S.P.I.C.E. is a nutritional program operated by the International Drop-In Center located at 610 S. Weller to ""stretch"" the low income of the elderly living within and around the International District, and to help avoid malnutritronal problems. S.P.I.C.E., a federally funded project supervised by the King County nutrition program, offers an inexpensive lunch, 65 cents for senior citizens and $1.50 for other participants on a first come first served basis.


""This program was conceived from a proposal written about four months ago when forming the Filipino Senior Citizen's Club,"" says Ben Rafanan, director of the IDIC. ""The lunch program will be a permanent part of the center, and is open to the public.""


The IDIC is staffed with a professional cook and dieticians who co-ordinate and plan the meals. Rafanan says, ""There is enough food for 40 people but 50 come so we supplement it with Filipino food."" Meals are served Monday through Friday from 11:30 to 12:30 with a different menu every day.


When asking an elderly gentleman whether he liked his food he said, ""Sure, otherwise I wouldn't be down here eating.""


Regular IDIC lunchers like the program because less spice is better for their health. As one gentlemen put it, ""There's no Filipino food in the menu, so they call it SPICE."" A Beacon Hill resident saw it another way, ""The lunch is good because they only charge 65 cents."" Another elderly gentleman declared, ""As long as Mrs. Mendoza cooks, I come down every day, the food is good.""

Community control rather than commercial control of parking is the theme of the new International. District parking program spearheaded by some members of the International District Economic Association (IDEA). The program, which regulates the use of parking lots during evening, weekend and stadium event hours, is designed to make sure that residents, employees and patrons of the ID find parking spaces within the District.


In addition, Stadium patrons will be charged to park in the spaces in the District, rather than taking up District parking spaces without paying.


Glenn Chinn, coordinator of the program, stated that 85 to 90 residents and employees of the district have signed up to rent monthly parking in the lots during evening and weekend hours Chinn said there are about 200 available spaces in six lots in the area. Included are the SeaFirst Bank, Rainier Bank, 7th Avenue Service, Uwajimaya, Officemporium and United Savings parking lots.


Restaurant and hotel owners are also signing up to rent spaces for their customers.


The main thrust of the program is to charge only enough to operate the program, with all excess profit going to the community, according to Chinn. He stressed that the program is non-profit, contrasted with commercial parking management programs which seek a profit. The program is cooperatively run by the member businesses.


The Interim lot under the freeway may also be added to the program, but final details have not yet been worked out.


Chinn said that residents and employees of the District can still sign up for parking spaces between 6 pm and 8 am. The charge is $7/month. A few daytime spaces are also available for $9 per month.


The parking group is also trying to develop a pool of people to run the program, especially those willing to work for four hours on Stadium days. The pay scale is variable, but a minimum of $3.50 per hour will be paid to the parking attendants.


Chinn said the program has been successful so far. They are also considering a validation system in which customers of ID stores can obtain free parking by validating a ticket with a purchase of goods.


To sign up for spaces call 624-6248.

""Peasants of the Second Fortress,"" a film depicting the struggle of Japanese peasants against an airport development which would deprive them of farming and, will be shown at 526 S. Jackson St. Sunday, June 27 at 1 p.m. The film, made in 1971, will be presented by the Sanrizuka Support Committee. It is about 2 1/2 hours long and admission is complimentary.


The airport project was started in June, 1966, but has been held up because of the joint efforts of peasants, workers and students in building fortresses, sabotaging government construction and resisting the military police who have tried to remove farmers from their land.


Two 10-story iron towers have been built by the peasants, making plane landing and take-off impossible. The airport was planned with longer runways than the Haneda airport to accomodate American B-52 bombers during the Viet Nam war.


The film will also be shown at Guggenheim Hall at the University of Washington, Friday, June 25 at 7:30 p.m., with the Asian Student Association as cosponsor, and Saturday, June 26 at Blaine Memorial Church, 3001-24th S. at 7:30 p.m.


The black and white film has English subtitles and is released by Ogawa Productions, a Japanese film company.

Much of what is now the International District or Chinatown was once covered with tideflats. That was over 65 years ago, before the city decided to regrade Jackson St. and fill in the tideflats.


Water came up as far as Ninth Ave. and Jackson St. at one time. The shoreline was apparently stretched outward into the bay as the tideflats were filled. Just before the regrade in 1907, the tideflats went up to Fifth Ave. and Lane Street, and curved around old Beach Road to the foot of Beacon Hill.


Above Eighth Ave. was a very steep hill. On the southeast corner of Ninth and Jackson stood Holy Names Academy The academy was moved because of the regrade project.


High as Beacon Hill


The top of the hill, along Twelfth Ave., was nearly as high as the top of Beacon Hill with only a small slope at Dearborn Ave. (presently the Twelfth Ave. Bridge) connecting the two hills.


The terrain made it difficult for farmers in Rainier Valley to bring their produce to downtown markets.


""Some farmers used to go around Auburn to get to town,"" said Ward Collier, city engineering specialist who made films about Seattle's regrade projects.


R.H. Thomson, city engineer at the time, considered building a tunnel through Beacon Hill. He chose to regrade Jackson instead, Collier said, because it was less expensive and would benefit the area more than the tunnel project.


Jackson Regrade largest


Collier pointed out that there were 62 regrades in the city. He said that the Jackson Street Regrade was the largest at the time. ""It extended all the way south to Lander St. and westward to Alaskan Way,"" said Collier.


The proposed plan called for a 90-foot cut at Ninth and Jackson, where the freeway now stands. According to Bill Spiedal, editor of Seattle Guide, ""you can put an eight-story building on top of the freeway...that was how high the hill was.""


In 1907, Lewis and Wiley Company was contracted for the project. A young civil engineer, W.C. Morse, informed Lewis, an eastern-trained lawyer and property owner in Rainier Valley, of the hydraulic method of regrading. He advised Lewis to begin an excavating company. Lewis did so -- under Morse's supervision.


Dearborn regraded


Shortly after the Jackson regrade began, the city also decided to regrade Dearborn. The plan was to cut out the Dearborn street slope and to replace it with a bridge to connect Beacon Hill with Jackson Street, which they did.


The entire project was a gigantic undertaking. According to a report by the Seattle Engineering Department, five and three-quarter miles of street or 56 city blocks were involved in the project.


""The greatest cut was 85 feet at Ninth Ave. and Jackson St., the grade of Jackson St. was reduced from 15 16% to 5.04%; and the street was widened from 66 feet to 96 feet. Grades on the streets to the north of Jackson were left steep but to the south they were brought down to 7.25% at the maximum on Weller St. and correspondingly on the other streets.""


Hill of clay


The hill was composed mostly of hard blue clay with little rock formation. The clay would shatter with only light blasting. A method called ""sluicing,"" using a water hose with added air pressure from a pipe connected to the nozzle, was used.


Water for the sluicing first came from Jefferson Park Reservoir. Later, pumping stations on Lake Washington and at the foot of Connecticut St. were added. The sluicing operation was carried to within a foot of the finished grade, the report said. The final grading was done with ""horse-drawn scraper.""


The pumps used on the sluicing operations were like those used on the Denny Regrade, the largest re-surfacing project in the city. The pump operators were veterans from Alaskan hydraulic mining operations.


""The process of mixing water and earth and various soils, and keeping the face of the excavation and the pipe lines open and full to capacity,"" the report said, ""was an interesting sight that brought full galleries of 'sidewalk superintendents.'""


Completed by 1910


By 1910, much of the regrade project was completed. According to the contractor, ""1,810,659 cubic yards of earth had been excavated and 1,252,688 cubic yards had been filled.""


The project, understandably, was not without problems. Sanitation in the district worsened with the filling of the tideflats because the drain and sewers got plugged. In addition, ""many of the buildings rested almost on the ground and had flooded during high tides,"" the report said. ""Some were raised on blocks and filled underneath.""


The regrade also created problems for some Japanese merchants on Main St. According to a 1909 article in Coast Magazine by the Japanese Consulate in Seattle, some of the merchants had to move their businesses down to Weller St.


Immediately after King St. was completed, a Chinese investment group, led by Goon Dip, honorary Chinese consulate and a wealthy businessman, built two large buildings on the south side of King, between Seventh and Eighth. Chinese businesses, including the Wa Chong and Yick Foon (which is still there), opened stores there in 1911. And the development of the present Chinatown or King Street core had begun.


According to Clarence Bagley, historian, the entire Jackson regrade project was completed in 1914.

International District Housing Alliance members -- who met with Mayor Wes Uhlman January 29 -- were unsuccessful in persuading the City to recommend to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that 200 housing units be given to the ID under a federal rent subsidy program.


The Alliance is comprised of business persons, residents and community organizations.


Mitsue Doniego of the Housing Alliance presented the Mayor with over 1600 petition signatures to support an International District receipt of 200 housing units under the Section Eight Housing Assistance Program. Low income tenants pay only 25 per cent of the rent in housing units subsidized by Section Eight money.


Uhlman was told by a local HUD official that an additional 2,000 units might be made available to the region encompassing Seattle.


Phil Sherburne, from the Office of Policy Planning, told representatives from the International District that a Presidential proposal, calling for the 2,000 units, has not yet been acted upon by Congress. The proposal would quadruple the number of units available under Section Eight funds. Sherburne said.


The Mayor said, ""Our city lobbyist is back there at the present time and they just had a meeting with HUD.""


The Housing Alliance charges the ID was discriminated against in the last round of Section Eight fund allocations. At that time the District received only 24 rehabilitated units out of an available 308.


The City's original recommendation was for 99 units.


Elaine Ko, of the International District Improvement Association (Interim), told the Mayor that he was not taking the ""strong advocate role"" that he should in the area of housing. She said representatives from the District should not have to go up to the Mayor's office with every grievance.


Ko asked Uhlman for a specific commitment and response to the demand that 200 units be given to the ID.


""It would be improper to do at this point,"" Uhlman said.


Uhlman said, ""We have a responsibility for other parts of the city too."" The Mayor said that, because of a trend over the last 60 years, there is a ""very, very severe concentration of poor people in one part of the city."" One of the City's goals, he said was to try to disperse the living opportunities into all parts of the City.


Ben Rafanan, International Drop-In Center director, told the Mayor. We are always put in the background. We are always getting the crumbs of the money. We want the City to make a commitment.""


The International District is only asking for a fraction of the housing needed. Rafanan said. He pointed out that the International District has always been a residential area. The residents ""feel secure in the District,"" Rafanan said.


Housing Alliance members pointed out that the City uprooted many people in the District when it passed the Ozark Fire Ordinance. The City is responsible for the housing crisis. Housing Alliance members charged.


Uhlman responded, however, by saying that people had to feel secure from the hazard of fire. He said the City has tried to deal ""sensitively"" with enforcement of the Ordinance.


""We just hate to go in there and wash the people out into the streets,"" Uhlman added.

Since March, a group of Asian attorneys and law students have been providing legal counseling services at Interim, 627 S. Jackson, on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The attorneys, Diane Wong and Anthony Lee, are from Legal Services Inc. The students are from the University of Washington.


Gary Iwamoto, law student said, ""The legal services program in the International District was started because of the lack of accessibility between the law and the Asian community. A definite void exists in the community in that most folks don't know what their rights are. The program is intended to breach this void."" Iwamoto added that because Asians did not go into the legal profession, there were very few the Asian community could call their own.


The program was started by Tony Lee and Bob Yamagiwa. The law students are donating their time.


In the six months that services have been provided, a variety of legal problems have arisen. Iwamoto said most are in immigration. He said, ""Immigrants have been treated very harshly by the US legal system. As compared to citizens and permanent residents, immigrants, treated as 'aliens,' have very few rights. Constantly hassled by the Federal Bureau of Immigration, faced with the countless number of forms that have to be filled out, immigrants always live with the fear that they are doing something that will get them deported."" Bob Yamagiwa, former legal service attorney now in private practice, has been handling most of the immigration cases that have come into Interim.


Types of Cases


Other types of cases Include landlord-tenant problems, social security, labor contract problems, discrimination, and divorce. Iwamoto said that several divorce cases are very much connected to immigration. The client is usually a female immigrant who married an American citizen. Problems developed after she came to this country. She feels her husband is mistreating her. Most of these clients wish to remain in this country. But if the client divorces her husband, she is no longer legally married to an American citizen. The ultimate problem is that the client faces deportation. At this point, the intervention of an attorney becomes necessary to fight for the clients' right to stay in the US.


Another such area is landlord-tenant relations. Tenants often feel that they are powerless in the event that the landlord wants to kick a tenant out. The general rule is that the landlord cannot evict a tenant without good cause unless adequate notice is given. Most tenants do not know what limitations exist in the law to curb the power of the landlord to evict.


In some cases, said Iwamoto, people with legal problems come in too late for us to do anything about it. ""The goal of our program is to inform and encourage people to know their legal rights.""


Service Limitations


Iwamoto said there are some limitations to the services provided. First of all, only the attorneys are qualified to handle cases which will end in court. Because the two attorneys are from Legal Services, they are bound by Legal Services guidelines. These guidelines severely restrict the types of clients which the attorneys can handle. Basically, the guidelines reflect income levels. Only poverty level clients are qualified. A qualified client can only make $208 a month, including assets (bank account, worth of car and home, etc.) with allowances made for each dependent. The purpose of these guidelines, according to attorney Tony Lee, is to restrict the availability of the services to people who cannot, by any means, afford a private attorney. Lee added that the guidelines are, in effect, unfair to people of moderate incomes who also cannot afford private attorneys.


However, Iwamoto emphasized that this does not preclude people from coming in and asking for legal advice. Legal counseling is available. Iwamoto told about one case where the client who came in had suffered eye damage when a boy threw a penny in her eye. The accident happened 3 years ago in California. The client happened to be in an area where a group of boys were playing.


After the accident occurred, the boy promised to pay for any treatment resulting from the damage to the client's eye. Legal Services does not handle personal injury suits. In addition, her income was too high. However, the client was advised that she had a legitimate complaint and to contact the boy in California and was referred to an attorney in California. The end result was that the client collected $500. Iwamoto said it was a small victory but a victory nonetheless.


Don't Hesitate


Iwamoto said that if anyone has a legal problem, they should not hesitate. All potential clients will be interviewed before the attorneys make the decision that their income is too high. If that is the case, the attorneys will give the client advice on what to do and refer the matter to another party.


According to Diane Wong, legal services attorney, the group plans to expand the project. One goal is to get more Asian law students interested in the project. Students can get valuable experience in interviewing techniques, identification of legal problems, plus a better feel for the community.


Another long range goal is to conduct workshops in the community on various aspects of the law. The group feels that it has expertise in the areas of discrimination, welfare, landlord-tenant, and immigration and is prepared to hold informational workshops.


Formed Association


Iwamoto added that the Asian attorneys and law students in Seattle have formed an organization, the Asian Legal Association. The purpose of this group is to address the legal needs of the community. There are about 40 Asians in the legal profession (attorneys and law students) in Seattle.


Tony Lee added that the group of people connected with the legal services program, Diane Wong, Bob Yamagiwa, Rod Kawakami, Willon Lew, Michael Marr, Iwamoto, and himself, wish to acknowledge the support to the Inter*im staff for its cooperation in getting the program started and for allowing the group to utilize the Inter*im facilities.

The Asian-Pacific American Political Caucus endorsed Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford in the recent presidential election. On January 20, 1977, Jimmy Carter will be sworn in as President of the United States.


There seems to be a consensus among caucus members questioned by the Examiner. They see the Carter election as a step in the right direction, but not as an end in itself. Carter was endorsed, caucus members say, because he was the candidate who officially recognized Asians and their status as a minority group. He was the first candidate with Asians as an integral part of his national campaign. During one of the Ford-Carter debates, Carter made specific mention that consideration must be made for those for whom English is a second language.


Caucus member Arlene Oki said the caucus must continue to monitor Carter to see that he follows up on specific issues that relate to Asian Americans. Carter had said that he would see to the development of a minority talent bank. He has recognized a possible pardon for Iva Toguri and relocation reparations as issues. The caucus wants to see more Asians on significant commissions. Caucus members say Carter has recognized this need. Presently, for example, there are no Asians with either the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Office for Civil Rights or the committee which sees to the needs of the Vietnamese refugees.


Caucus member Lois Hayasaka stated there was no great enthusiasm for Carter, but there was enthusiasm for a change.


There will be a meeting to discuss the future of the caucus on Tuesday, November 23, at 8 p.m. It will be held at the Japanese Baptist Church, 901 E. Spruce St. All interested are invited to attend.

Ed. Note -- The Examiner has initiated a guest column. This month, Alan Kurimura, a legislative aide to City Councilman George Benson, gives his views on Asian Americans and the political process, Kurimura has been active in the Asian Community for several years.


In this bicentennial year and on the eve of yet another general election, the Asian community should reflect upon its historic participation in the political process and future courses of action (or inaction).


In the past our needs and aspirations have not been adequately transmitted or reflected in public decision-making. We have never been encouraged to participate in the political process beyond requests for political contributions to ""candidate X who will best serve us."" Giving funds to a particular party or candidate is generally accepted as a way to participate, but we can not limit ourselves to voting and contributing money. Effective participation in the political process requires continual, long term commitments.


We must learn how the process works and where we can be most effective. Individuals seeking public office and both of the major parties must know who we are before we can expect that they will respond to, or at least listen to our requests and demands.


For too long the Asian community in Seattle has been identified with the International District/Chinatown and specific projects which involve us. The Mayor and City Council and other local officials must come to recognize that we are not willing to give our vote and dollar for their support of a particular I.D. project. They must recognize that we also care about public policy decisions which are not directly related to the I.D. they must recognize the need to consider our points of view when they are determining the level of funding for the Parks and Recreation Department or negotiating with public employment unions on pay scales and work force levels.


We can never totally isolate I.D. matters from other decisions made on apparently unrelated subjects. The level of funding for the Parks and Recreations. Department can impact the I.D. (a reduced budget could lead to reduced maintenance of the parks in the I.D.) and work force level decisions can impact Asian public employees (cutting the work force needs in the Engineering Department could lead to a layoff process which, according to union contracts, means layoffs on a seniority basis, and how many Asians are at a management level with sufficient seniority to avoid being bumped to a lower staff level?).


I think we must begin actively participating in the political process. Initially it might be best to limit our efforts to a particular level of government. If this strategy is adopted a critical question is -- which level? What level of government appears most capable of responding to us? And where are our best chances of organizing interest for such an endeavor within our communities? My choices would be city government and state legislative races. The first appears most able to respond to us and the second requires the least amount of financial support and can be focused on specific districts with high percentages of Asians.


Once we have determined where to focus our efforts we can begin to organize. A voter registration drive and a means of critiquing candidates and monitoring officeholders are all essential. Also important are ways of maintaining contact with office holders, and a method to communicate with all components of the Asian communities must be developed Each of us should also have access to an organization which can be used to transmit our needs and demands through the political process.


I could go on with my perceptions and ideas of why and how we can improve our participation in the political process, but that should await responses from Examiner readers. I hope my ramblings have spurned some thought and feelings on a matter which I believe is critical to all of us.

The Chong Wah Benevolent Association has long been a major force in this community's affairs. Founded in the early part of this century, Chong Wah was formed to promote co-operation and self-help among Seattle's Chinese people.


In the beginning, Chong Wah served to bring the Chinese people together. At that time, there was no Chinese community to speak of. In fact, the name ""Chong Wah"" means ""Chinese."" Racism and discrimination were rampant -- exclusionary laws, anti-Chinese riots, and overall hostility prevailed against the Chinese immigrant.


Today, ""Chong Wah is the highest organization in the Chinese community -- just like City,"" explained Ling Mar, chairperson of Chong Wah's Community Affairs committee. The Chong Wah Board of Trustees is comprised of about 54 persons representing 27 different Chinese associations, societies, and organizations in the Chinese community. Mar said only two or three organizations do not belong to the Chong Wah Benevolent Society. As such, he said, ""Chong Wah represents the majority of the Chinese community.""


Chong Wah deals with matters affecting the Chinese community. ""Decisions,"" says Mar, ""are discussed and decided by the Board.""


Chow Role Clarified


In answer to a frequently asked question, Mar replied, ""Ruby Chow does not run Chong Wah. While it is true that she is certainly most vocal and that she does carry a lot of influence, the Board of Trustees is comprised of 54 individuals, each it is hoped, with their own independent minds to make decisions.""


In fact, there are those who say that Ling Mar is one of the most influential persons in Chong Wah, if not the most influential. Because of contacts with prominent downtown businessmen and other ""important"" people, it has been said that Ling Mar has the last word on decisions in Chong Wah.


Preservation of Chinatown's identity and character is the foremost objective of Chong Wah today. ""The area,"" stated Mar, ""must retain its identity. We (Chong Wah) have a responsibility to maintain Chinatown as an ethnic identification. We do not want to make it a melting pot. The area at the core of the International District is Chinatown -- most of the organizations are Chinese, most of the businesses are Chinese, and most of the property is owned by the Chinese. It has a long history of being Chinese.""


""The International District,"" continued Mar, ""was created by some mayor who arbitrarily set guidelines, fixed boundary lines, and decided to call it ""International District."" We have no quarrel with the other ethnics in the community, but it is important to retain the identity of the area as Chinatown.""


ID Concept Won't Work


Mar believes, ""The International District concept won't work in reality."" By mixing many ethnic groups in one area, the community would ""lose its ethnic identity.""


""We are going to fight like hell,"" said Mar, ""if any group wants to infringe on the Chinatown character, specifically for any group that sets guidelines, restrictions, or regulations that will impede the growth of the community.""


Citing one example, Mar referred to a proposition that all Association headquarters could not exist at street level. The idea was for these Associations to move back 60 feet or relocate upstairs, off street level Mar said. ""We have been here for years. Chinese folks made it grow. Then these people come in and tell us how to run these businesses.""


As for the future of the International District, Chong Wah has definite plans. In looking ahead, they have purchased property next to Chong Wah headquarters. Mar elaborated. ""We want to put in medical facilities for the elders and a recreational center such as a gym for the youth. We want to be able to help the community.""


No Position on Stadium


Chong Wah has no definite position on the Domed Stadium. Mar said that while individual members have their own ideas, Chong Wah, as a body, has never come up with a formal statement. The reason? Mar replied, ""It has never come up for discussion. Someone can bring it up for discussion, but it never has in the past."" Mar believed that while the stadium would have some impact on businesses, traffic, and in other areas, it won't wipe Chinatown out.


As for housing conditions, it was mentioned previously that much of the property in the International District is owned by the Chinese. Mar said that one of Chong Wah's future goals is the redevelopment of the community. For example, Mar stated that pressure would be put to property owners in the effort to preserve and redevelop Chinatown.


Relations with other elements in the community are ""fairly good and open,"" said Mar. ""We don't have an isolationist policy. We are willing to work with other groups in the community if and when the need arises.""


Although misunderstandings have occurred in the past, Mar said, ""We are doing what we have to do for the community -- just as others are doing what they can do within their own jurisdiction Our position is, ""Let me do my own thing, you can do yours.""


""The important thing,"" said Mar, ""is that we want a place for the Chinese to come to. We want to preserve the cultural identity, the uniqueness, and the character of Chinatown.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Combined Asian-American Resources Project, Inc. (CARP) this month will release its first reprinted novel -- the story of a Nisei trying to find his way back into the American mainstream after having gone to prison rather than fighting for the U.S. during World War II.


The novel, ""No-No Boy,"" by John Okada, was originally published in Japan in 1957 Okada, a Nisei, was born and raised in Seattle. Many scenes in the novel are set in the International District.


Okada wrote that there were many reasons for his protagonist's refusal to fight for the American army. ""There is,"" Okada said, ""the bitterness of the evacuation, the unrelenting pressure of his fanatically pro-Japanese mother, the faith in his country which has been shattered and the ugliness of the knowledge of a prejudice hateful and mighty enough to uproot a thousand seemingly American homes.""


CARP considers Okada's novel one of the great works of American fiction. The organization seeks to publish other pioneer works of fiction plays and poetry by Asian American writers.


CARP, a non-profit, tax-exempt-organization, was founded by leffery Chan Frank Chin, Lawson Inada and Shawn Wong, the editors of ""Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian American Writers.""

When the International Examiner was first conceived by District businessmen Lawrence Imamura and Gerald Yuasa, and published by George Cox in 1974, its focus was the retail and commercial interests of the International District. Published by merchants of the I.D., it was ""...distributed...at selected outlets (of) significant interest in the International District and (where) commerce exists.""


In March, 1975, the Alaska Cannery Workers Association bought the publication from Cox While the paper continued a commitment to the general preservation and growth of the International District, it began introducing more social concerns to its readership.


Since June, 1976, the Examiner has undergone changes in size and content. There has been an expansion to eight pages from the original four, and there is a possibility of an increase to twelve pages in the near future. We now carry articles pertaining to Seattle's Asian community at large. More businesses outside the ID are advertising in the paper.


The current expansion has led the Examiner staff to look in two directions While the paper will maintain its focus on the I.D., with additional advertising revenue it is possible to develop a larger readership outside the District With that in mind, the Examiner could conceivably develop into a regional Asian American publication.


Since the late 1960's, there has been no doubt that a single Asian American community exists in Seattle.


Compared to other cities with significant Asian population, Seattle's different Asian ethnic groups live together in certain areas, rather than forming separate Chinatowns, Nihonmachi, or Manilatowns.


At present, the Examiner is the publication most widely read by a cross section of Seattle's Asian American community The fact that no existing Asian vernacular journal has accomplished this feat gives the International Examiner a strong advantage in developing this market and serving the interests of the larger Asian community.


We have, in fact, recently started to carry news from California Asian communities which we think may be of interest to Asians in the Northwest.


But there persists an identification association made between the I.D. and the greater Asian community. The I.D. is the community's historical base. It remains an integral, active part of the community for a number of cultural social and commercial reasons.


Because of this, the International Examiner has, and will retain, its base in the I.D. But by increasing its readership it will serve to bring the concerns of the I.D. to the community at large. And at the same time, news of events across the region's Asian community can be consolidated in one publication.


Drop us a line and tell us what you think of what we're doing.

The United Garment Workers Union last month approved over 200 dollars for translation of its new three-year contract into Chinese and the printing of 300 copies for distribution to its Chinese workers.


The Executive Board of the United Garment Workers Union, Local 17, at a September 29 meeting, voted unanimously to approve the request of two Chinese Media Committee members for $212.50, $100 for translation and $112.50 for xeroxing. October 4, the union membership voted to accept the Executive Board's recommendation.


Bertha McVay, the union's business agent, said about six or seven Chinese garment workers have already approached the union about getting a copy of the translated contract. McVay said she told them it would be several weeks before the contracts would be ready for distribution.


McVay said the contract would be made available to the garment workers in the various shops as they paid their does.


The United Garment Workers Union represents approximately 800 Seattle workers, a sizeable number of whom are Chinese non-English speaking women.


The Chinese Media Committee, in a June 23 letter to the garment union, requested a copy of the newly approved contract so the organization could translate it and distribute it to the Chinese workers.


Margaret Rogers, union president, told the Examiner in August that the Chinese copies of the contract would only be distributed to those who came to the union requesting one. The Media Committee felt that this approach would not reach all the Chinese garment workers because many would be reluctant to come to the union. The Media Committee wanted to distribute the Chinese contract themselves to all the Chinese.


At the same time, Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) a community organization of Chinese, has set a conference for garment workers on November 14, from 1:30 to 4 p.m. at the Chinese Information Center, 410-7th Ave. S. The conference, organizers say, will attempt to encourage Chinese workers to begin speaking out on various complaints they have about working conditions.


Asian attorneys will be present to inform the Chinese women of their legal rights Several garment workers will be featured as speakers and there will be a slide show about garment shops.

The International District Housing Alliance recently passed a resolution to support efforts to resist further evictions of hotel residents in the district. Government, they said, should relocate evicted residents within the area.


The resolution was one of three passed at the Far West Convention Sectoral Conference on July 31. It reads: ""We hereby support all efforts to fight further evictions at premises they (the residents) are now residing in and furthermore, because of the urgent housing problem, the government should be made responsible to relocate residents within the International District.""


Other resolutions passed obligated the alliance to support and actively work towards the goals of the upcoming Pilipino Peoples Far West Convention, and to support ""efforts of the Bush Hotel residents in fighting for their right to remain living in their rightful homes.""


The resolutions will be presented to the Convention's Housing Workshop next month. They were passed at a time when some 30 tenants were to be evicted from the New Central Hotel and when some fear the possible eviction of 140 Bush Hotel residents.


The conference keynote speaker, Dawn Canton, Frye Hotel resident and longtime community activist, told the audience that ""the city should build new housing before closing one down."" Raising several questions about certain features of the layout plans for the future Century Construction housing project, she said, ""these questions must be dealt with before construction.""


Some 70 persons attended the conference at the International Terrace. It was co-sponsored by the Alliance and Pilipino Peoples Far West Convention.


The Pilipino convention itself, will be held at the University of Washington on September 3-5.


A ""follow-up"" housing conference is scheduled in the near future to accomodate the non-English speaking Chinese in the district.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Unless the mayor acts soon, the 60 residents of Chinatown's International Hotel will be evicted.


On September 3, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of the International Hotel Tenants Association (IHTA). IHTA was asking for reversal of an earlier Superior Court decision that the Four Seas Investment Corp. had the right to evict tenants of the hotel.


During the middle of September, the tenants were discussing strategies to deal with the pending evictions. At press time, the eviction notices had not yet been posted. Five days after the notices are posted, Four Seas has the legal right to demand that the tenants vacate the hotel. IHTA representatives said that even when the notices are posted, the residents will not move because they have nowhere to go.


Nancy Erickson, of IHTA, told the Examiner their lawyers were planning to file suit soon, charging violation of the civil rights of the tenants.


""There isn't any replacement housing,"" she said.


Most of the hotel residents are elderly Filipino and Chinese males, who have lived in the hotel many years. Supporters of the hotel tenants point out that the International Hotel, located on Kearney and Jackson St., is part of the last block of what used to be a 10-block Manilatown. Only one block remains, however, as the financial district has slowly advanced.


The hotel, built in 1907, has become the focal point of the housing crisis in Chinatown and the symbol of the community opposition to corporate control.


On May 24, San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, in a letter to IHTA, pledged to explore the possibility of having the city purchase the hotel, later selling it back to the tenants. Moscone stated however that ""any plan for retention of the International Hotel that could endorse must be legal and must be financially feasible.""


IHTA points out, however, that the Mayor's plan is based on a number of factors. The City must appraise the hotel at a low enough price for the IHTA to purchase it. Additionally, the tenants association hopes the Board of Supervisors approves block grant money for the purchase.


Supporters of the International Hotel say that the fight to prevent eviction has been continuing for about eight years. Eviction notices were put out about two years ago, at which time the tenants refused to move and the battle moved into the courts where it has been since.


In 1968, Milton Meyer Co which owned the hotel, had plans to tear it down and build a parking lot. But because of resistance by the tenants, the company president decided to sell the hotel. The Four Seas Investment Corp finally bought it at the low price of $850,000. One rumor is that Four Seas wants to tear the hotel down and build a combination hotel, restaurant, shopping center on that block.


Four Seas also purchased the Victory Hotel, located next to the International Hotel, and the eviction of the tenants there is also pending.

The International District community has overwhelmingly chosen a ""traditional"" design for light fixtures that will be installed in the district as part of the Street Scaping Project, according to James Mason, I.D. District Manager who is coordinating the project.


The ""traditional"" design was chosen over two other designs, one reflecting a ""modern and the other a ""traditional-modern"" influence During two community meetings, the District Manager's office solicited community input on the selection and a questionnaire was distributed.


The Street Scaping Project calls for 256 light fixtures, each fixture and post costing $1,400. The fixtures will be installed in two phases throughout the District. According to Bob Suzuki of Church-Suzuki Architects, the firm which developed the three design alternatives, three light fixtures will be installed on sidewalks with no alleys and four on those with an alley. The fixtures will accompany the present street lights.


Mason said, ""The Department of Community Development is presently negotiating with the Engineering Department to hire Church-Suzuki Architects as consultants to draw up the construction documentation, the next phase of the plan.""


The first phase of construction and installation for the Street Scaping Project is expected to begin this fall. In addition to purchase of the light fixtures, the plan calls for installation of 152 light fixtures, planting 133 trees, and construction of new sidewalks curbs, corner extensions and stree medians with trees.


""The improvements during this phase,"" Mason said, will occur within the core of the District -- around King Jackson, and Maynard Streets.


Phase Two of the project, he added ""will begin no later than July, 1977."" This phase of the project calls for more sidewalk and corner construction, the planting of an additional 175 trees, and installation of the remaining 104 light fixtures in the area peripheral to the District's core.


""The entire project is estimated to cost $1,397,000,"" Mason said Funding for the project comes from the City's Community Block Grant for 1975 and 1976.

Retail and commercial trade in the International District have gradually re-vitalized and future prospects for the area are good. That is the general impression the Examiner found after talking to businesspeople in the district.


The district ""bottomed-out"" two years ago, said Jerry Yuasa, branch manager of the Seattle-First National Bank. The domed stadium has had a ""good"" impact, he said, and there is a ""re-interest, an awakening among Asians,"" towards the district. Yuasa, as well as others, is optimistic about the retail and commercial growth of the district. They pointed out the growing number of new and expanding business in the area.


District was Bleak


Just three years ago, the commercial picture of the district was bleak. A study of the economic potential in the area by Northwest American, a consultant group headed by John Huston, said: ""The over-all impression the district gives is one of deterioration and neglect. There is considerable unused and underused space both at street level on the main retail streets, on the upper floors of closed hotels, and on vacant land. The level of activity on the streets is low in most parts of the district and the storefronts are old and neglected.""


Some Closed


Within the last five years, according to the Examiner's unofficial tally: three taverns, a ping pong parlor, herb shop, gift shop, insurance agent, two restaurants, and two light industrial companies either closed or moved out of the district.


In addition, several hotels have closed, but their closures were due more to their failure to meet the city's fire and building code requirements than because of the lack of a demand for housing.


On the other hand, four restaurants were taken over by new owners and remodeled. Furthermore, an unofficial count shows that in this same period, a number of new businesses started: nine restaurants, a large antique business, a large office furniture and supply store, seven food import stores, two light industrial companies, a 100-unit housing project, and a number of professional commercial establishments.


Four restaurants also expanded, including the new Sun Ya which moved to Weller Street, and a bank which expanded with a new facility.


The bulk of the gain, then, has been in the Asian foods area -- imported food stores and restaurants -- reinforcing the International District as an ""Asian Specialty"" area with a regional market. Since the 1950's, with the sharp decline in residential population, the district has specialized in providing Asian products and services and serving more of a regional rather than local residential population.


Tourists, Small Part


Contrary to popular belief, tourists and non-Asians make up only a small part of the overall clientele of the district. The over-whelming majority of those who patronize the district's retail market are Asians residing outside of the area, according to some businesspeople. Most of the restaurants, except a few such as Four Seas, Tai Tung, and China Gate, rely on an Asian clientele. Although there are a few new retail businesses and professional services serving a non-Asian clientele, the Asian pattern has not significantly changed.


Business in the district has been generally good. For some, particularly some restaurants, business has been very good.


Greg Chew, head waiter at Hong Kong Restaurant, said that business has been ""very good,"" particularly since they started serving ""dim sum,"" Chinese pastries. Hong Kong averages 500 to 600 customers per day, that number doubling on weekend days.


The number of Chinese patrons increased from 30 to 60 per cent since they began serving pastries, Chew said. He estimated that at least 90 per cent of those who eat there live outside of the district.


Increased Business


Domed stadium traffic, Chew said, has increased business between 10 and 15 per cent, while tourists from out-of-town make up no more than 15 per cent of their business. Chew said that he thinks that the other restaurants in the district are also doing well.


Elaine Young, part owner of the new Linyen Restaurant, said that the district is unique and that she wanted to open a restaurant to being ""outsiders"" into the area. Linyen is newly remodeled with open space and large windows. It has a modern and lively atmosphere very different from other restaurants in the district.


""The district is developing,"" she said, ""and I wanted to be a part of it.""


Across the street from Uwajimaya, Alex Nicolas, manager of Fiesta Filipina, a three-year-old Filipino food store, said that business is ""fair."" The domed stadium, he said, has not affected his business. Almost all of his customers are Filipino, he noted.


Larry Imamura, owner of an office furniture and supply store, began his business three years ago. His business is unique in that it has a product that is not an ""Asian Specialty."" Yet, his business is ""steadily improving."" The district, Imamura said, offered a central location for his business.


Impetus for Growth


It is people like Young, Nicolas and Imamura that are providing the impetus for commercial growth in the district. ""Property owners and tenants,"" Yuasa said, ""are primarily the ones to make the moves to develop the district."" There has been a substantial increase among those people in the district for loans, he noted.


Planned for the near future are two more restaurants, a travel agency, 199 units of low-income housing, additional office and commercial space, and the expansion of a bank facility, retail store, and noodle factory.


There is also some discussion of turning the recently closed New Central Hotel into a commercial building. There are also the up-coming capital improvement projects for the district and the future multi-service center.


Peripheral to the district, there are plans for a $75 million convention/hotel complex northwest of the stadium, the development of Pioneer Square and the high potential of development for the area between that district and the International District, and some discussion of completing the southern exit on 1-5 to the district.


""It's hard to say what will happen in the future,"" said Paul Mar, economic consultant for the public corporation's multi-service center feasibility study, ""because of the diverse ownership of buildings in the area."" But, he added, ""the climate is right for customer-oriented retail business.""


Encourage Others.


""The fact that people are coming into the district will encourage others to invest in their business,"" Mar said. ""For that to happen, it will take the continual investment of the city and the ability of the banks in the area to assist businesses to locate in the district. It means that the trusts (associations) and businesses will have to look into the long-run. Two facts, the domed stadium is here to stay and Pioneer Square is here to stay.""


Tomio Moriguchi, president of Uwajimaya, noted that because of the ""geographic proximity of the area to downtown, it is inevitable that something is going to happen."" Uwajimaya, the area's largest retail store, plans to ""substantially expand"" in the near future.


Expressing his optimism towards the district's future, Moriguchi pointed out millions of dollars in private investment in the district, the construction of new parks and other future public projects.


Imamura said that the area warrants a block or two more of commercial and retail establishments. Other business will follow, he said. A major problem, Imamura said, is the lack of young Asians pursuing careers in business -- people who might be willing to take the risk and open a business in the area.


The economic report on the district said that what the district needed was momentum. That momentum has begun.

The Seattle Chinatown -- International District Preservation and Development Authority, better known as the ""public corporation,"" is now at work after a stormy year in the formation.


Ben Woo is the newly elected council chairperson. Other Executive Board members include: Roy Mar, vice chairperson, Ted Choi, secretary, Tomio Moriguchi, treasurer and James Young, member-at-large.


The public corporation's immediate function is to develop plans for the International District community center. Council members will be working in conjunction with the Department of Community Development on the plan.


The group will hold a special meeting to gain community input on the criteria and guidelines they have developed for the ID community center on March 22 at 7:30 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Wing Luke Museum, 414-Eighth Avenue South.


In the next few months the council must review existing community center proposals, identity and establish community center criteria, and solicit available properties and new proposals for the center.


The council meetings are scheduled on Wednesdays at noon. The meeting place is the social hall of the International Terrace Apartment Building located at 206-6th Avenue South. All meetings are open to the public.

The long-awaited community center will soon become a reality. The site of the center is the Bush Hotel, located on the southwest corner of Maynard Ave. and So Jackson St.


The preliminary architectural plans for the center, prepared by the Burke Associates, were approved by the corporation council last month.


The plans include space for meeting rooms, museum, library and social service offices. There will also be 9,000 square feet for retail/commercial usage. The present residential hotel will be retained on the upper floors.


""The existing six floor Bush Hotel was built to support 10 floors and has a concrete frame structure which has withstood Seattle's major earthquakes without damage,"" said Ed Burke, architectural and planning consultant for the center project.


The Bush Hotel was one of several buildings built in the boom following the Jackson Street Regrade,"" Burke said. ""Seattle had a substantial influx of foreign-born single males between 1910 and 1920. Most of them were housed in the hotels which were developed near the new railway stations.""


""William Chappell who built the Bush Hotel made his fortune in Alaska during the gold rush. When he returned to Seattle he invested in properties in the Jackson St area When he died in 1921 he owned twelve buildings in the International District most of which housed Japanese businesses and residents.""


""It is appropriate that the Bush Hotel, one of the district's finest structures, should play a role in the renaissance of this important area of our city,"" said Burke.


Cultural activities will be located on the lower floor to the north, adjacent to Hing Hay Park. ""Access to the meeting rooms will be developed beyond the library, museum and gallery located near the entrance from the park,"" Burke explained. The library will be devoted to Asian and Asian American subjects and be a resource for those speaking Asian languages. A retail gallery will be developed adjacent to the museum.


Retail activities on the main floor will be completely redeveloped. ""The present retail frontage is limited to forty feet,"" Burke said. ""The renovation will provide over three hundred and thirty lineal feet most of which would be arranged along a new galleria connecting Jackson Street to Hing Hay Park.""


A landscaped covered terrace will be developed overlooking the park, providing a platform for ceremonial occasions.


""The existing fireplace in the galleria will be activated and create a warm enclosure,"" Burke said. ""The galleria will have a new hydraulic elevator connecting the main floor to the new social service offices on the second floor and to the community hall on the lower floor.""


Social services will be housed in newly developed office space on the second floor. Most of the partitions would be removed to provide flexible space. Consolidation of social services is expected to improve service delivery and facilitate referral of clients from one agency to another.


Additional plumbing and new electrical service will be provided on the four residential hotel floors. The work will be undertaken to permit the present tenants to remain in the hotel and benefit from the improvements. Access to the hotel would be provided through a new lobby fronting on Jackson St. The exterior of the entire building will be cleaned and repainted.


The total cost of the project. Burke said, is $1,286,000.00, $450,000 provided by the City and the balance provided through private financing. ""The Bush Hotel renovation,"" he said, ""should augment the commercial and social revitalization which is presently taking place in the district.""

For Japanese immigrants and their children, sports, such as baseball served as both recreational and social institutions. Over the years, thousands of young Nisei men and women played baseball, basketball and football in teams and leagues organized in the Japanese community throughout the state.


This month marks the fiftieth year celebration of the Taiyo Athletic Club. For some old timers in their 60's and 70's, this will be the occasion to see old friends who now live in other places such as Japan, California and Chicago.


Shig Osawa, one of the oldest Nisei in Seattle, tells of sandlot baseball games at 5th and Main . . . the turn of the century. The few Japanese and Chinese kids in the neighborhood at that time played catch all the way to South School, the old Bailey Gatzert and home. Occasionally, Osawa recalls, they challenged ""a team of white kids from up on 10th and Main.""


There was often no money even for a ball, so Osawa ""got up 5 cents and bought a rubber ball."" Then he wrapped twine around it many times, and sewed a cloth cover with a darning needle. When they couldn't find a nickel, they even tried using a rock, wrapping the twine over it.


In 1906, the first Japanese baseball team was established, the Nippon Club, composed of young Issei men who toiled in typical immigrant jobs in canneries, janitorial, and domestic service. At about the same time, the Columbia Club from Tacoma, the Hayato, a Kagoshima group and the Mikado team started up.


Trips to Japan were made during this early time and games with Japanese college teams were held. The Nippon, Mikado and Columbia clubs went to Japan in 1914.


The Japanese School, established by the Japanese Association in 1904, was a likely place for young Nisei to play ball and it was here that Osawa taught Tura Nakamura, whom he later played ball with, to pitch and catch.


Perhaps the first Nisei team to organize was the Cherries, started by Mr. Doi in 1911. Doi got Osawa to play. The next year some Mikado people left that team and joined some Cherry team members to form the Asahi Club including Nakamura, Fukuda and Hide Kobayashi.


The new Asahi team played in the Star League B Class sponsored by the Spalding Sports Equipment company.


Other Issei teams flourished at this time, the Niko Niko, Great Union and Hayato.


The Asahis became the strongest team and rivalry with the Mikados was intense. According to Osawa, legitimate businesses favored the Asahis, but the Shitamachi (underworld) represented by the Toyo gambling club, favored the Mikado. Heavy game betting led to controversy over an umpire's decision at a championship game. A right ensued and a gun was pulled, said. Kenji Kawaguchi, former sports player. Osawa said the betting involved high stakes such as automobiles.


By 1919, the Asahi and Mikados each had three teams even though the Asahi were having financial trouble, due to mismanagement of the team's funds. Once $3000 or $4000 was mysteriously lost, Osawa, an Asahi member said. In 1921, a certain manager quit when the team was $3000 in debt and Tura Nakamura, George Ishihara and Osawa were left to handle the team.


They put the team into a newly-formed semi-pro league and traveled to play teams in other towns, as far away as Montana and Spokane. Through conservative management of funds, the team earned enough to travel and to make up for back debts.


In 1923, the team even went to the West Coast Japanese team championship in San Francisco. They met Fresno in over 100 degree heat. The bench of the Seattle team faced the sun. Uncomfortable in the heat, they dropped the title.


By 1924, Mr. Miyasawa was able to unite the two clubs, the Mikados and Asahis into the new Nippon Athletic Club, taking the best players form both teams. By this time, football and basketball were added to the activities.


In 1926, the Taiyo Club was started, accomodating the next best players in the community. George Ishihara was the first president and Ban Okada was responsible for organizing the group for many years. George Nishimura, prominent salmon cannery contractor, helped fund the original Taiyo Cardinals.


Kenjiro Yoshino, one of the few young Issei on the Taiyo team, said most parents favored the second generation's preoccupation with such good, clean sport as baseball. ""It kept the kids out of mischief,"" he said. Most Issei parents, though they had not played baseball in Japan, enthusiastically attended league games and championships and cheered their sons to victory.


A Junior League started in 1928 with sandlot teams such as the R.F. Giants, Indians, Asahi Cherries and Asahi Midgets. Later, the Dearborn Huskies joined as the Taiyo Cubs.


The Japanese American Courier, a Nisei newspaper published by James Sakamoto sponsored an athletic league from 1928 until the war broke out. It included baseball, basketball and football sections. It also included a girls' basketball league. The coaches volunteered their time.


Many young team players displayed excellent athletic ability and joined varsity and all-city teams. Kenji Kawaguchi made the first team in baseball when he was only a freshman at Franklin High School. Kay Takayoshi became a semi-pro umpire.


The Taiyos reached peak membership in the mid-30's with a roster of 120 members, five baseball, three football and three basketball teams. They competed in the Courier Leagues, Inter-City, Inter-District Class B, Independent City, as well as the Fourth of July and Labor Day baseball Tournaments.


The Fourth of July brought the annual Japanese state baseball championship at Columbia field, now the Rainier Playfield. An all-weekend event, it brought hundreds of Nikkei out to enjoy the vendors, booths and games. Started in the late 30's, it continued until the war broke out.


The annual highlight, though, was the championship between the Taiyos and the Nippon Athletic Club.


The teams earned money to pay for equipment by having Shibai, theatrical programs consisting of Japanese and American skits and dramatic presentations, musical talent acts, instrumental performances by young and old. The teams continued to sponsor exchange trips to Japan, including education tours for men and some for women.


Toward the end of the 30's and early 40's, sports interests were changing, and some older Nisei started taking up golf and fishing, according to some old Taiyo members. Only one Taiyo team entered league competition in 1941.


After the war, the teams were not started up again, because ""everyone was too busy,"" according to Kawaguchi. Yoshino pointed out that many community leaders who had helped out with the youth teams were now more concerned with survival matters such as gaining back property, businesses and finding homes for their families after the war.


Yoshino said the start of Little League after the war took many Japanese youngsters away from the possible start of a new team. Of course, many Sansei today are concerned more with basketball, Yoshino conceded.


Tad Kuniyuki, another former Taiyo player, feels much respect is due the Sakamotos -- James and his wife Misao for the many hours they put into their newspaper, making the Courier Leagues possible. A former sports writer for the Courier, Kuniyuki said the Sakamotos spent countless unrewarded hours for the sake of the young second generation.


The Taiyos have had several reunions since the first after the war in 1960. This, their golden jubilee should, indeed, be a very special one.

The International District Community Health Center on Maynard Avenue across from the park is probably the most consistent and down-to-earth service for residents of the District at the present time. Every day its doors open to serve coffee, tea, and good medical care in five languages to the low income, undernourished and neglected elderly who dominate the District's population.


On a national scale, the ID Health Center has been singled out for a demonstration project utilizing bilingual visiting nurses with a grant from HEW. The Center's classes in preventative health care fill the center every week. The small storefront space is always crowded, with about ten conversations going on at once, say the clinic staff.


Funding Trouble


Why is it the center is having trouble with funding? As a joint city and county project, the center staff must run back and forth from one local government to the other, making deals, lobbying, requesting, and demanding a few more dollars to continue the present successful program. The city recommended that the clinic needed $56,000 the first year and $117,000 the second year.


But when it came down to block grant allocation time only $25,000 was recommended for the Center, so the county matched that. But after a rainsoaked outdoor protest by the elderly and clinic staff, the city council recommended $56,000. Now it is up to the county to match that figure.


Spellman Interested


A meeting with John Spellman at the beginning of this month produced nothing, except the promise that Spellman was interested. The county is now ""looking for the money,"" while the city's $56,000 share of the allocation sits in limbo.


A clinic evaluator recently suggested that the elderly have shown an increased stress level perhaps due to stadium traffic patterns, more crowds in the area and waiting lines in their favorite older restaurants. The clinic is now, more than ever, a place for them to go to be cared for and understood.


Support the Center


The Examiner feels that the ID Health Center's problems are everyone's problems. Residents and social service workers are not the only ones who should be pressuring the County for this funding. The support of business people, too, would be greatly appreciated. Business people have nothing to lose by helping to bring improvements in housing and health care to District residents.


Most importantly, however, the County must be responsible to match the City's promised funding level. As the stadium is finally completed and is now receiving the high praise of many, the County's job is not done for those surrounding areas which the stadium is impacting.

The Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority (public corporation) will hold an open meeting. Wednesday, August 25 at 7:30 p.m. at the International Terrace.


The purpose of the meeting is for the consultant group MCS-TPG, Paul Mar, Director, to present its analysis report on the space requirements for the community service center.


All persons interested in the community center project being undertaken by the public corporation should attend to provide input on the report.


The $100,000 funding which does exist is provided by grants from the Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Services, King County, and the City of Seattle.


60% of the registered patients at the Health Center are 60 years of age or over, thus the AAA was asked for funding. The AAA determined to reject IDCHC's request because the Dept of Public Health recommended against it, saying the IDCHC had sufficient funding.


However, IDCHC has been placed on a priority list to receive funding from AAA if there is any excess from other AAA-funded projects. So, Miyahara said, ""We're still in the ball game.""


The IDCHC opened its doors in November of 1975 as the result of community demands on County Executive John Spellman.


The patient load for the clinic was predicted to be ten people a day, but 25-30 people are now served daily.


Four nurses employed by the Health Center conduct screening sessions in hotel lobbies, the park, or wherever possible. They check for health disorders such as TB and high blood pressure. Each nurse also makes 3 to 4 home visits a day.

The Bush Hotel is possibly a more economically feasible site for the proposed community center than the Howard Dong property on 6th Ave. and King St., according to an informal feasibility analysis conducted at the public corporation's June 9 meeting.


Contention over the two possible sites for the International District social service center has continued for over three months.


Howard Dong, architect and public corporation board member, stated, ""Any time you have a public group, there will be two sides, so to speak."" Dong indicated the corporation's council was composed of a forceful group, influenced by James Mason, city staff person in the District, which was pushing through the Bush Hotel site. The opposition group, called the Chong Wa group by some, actually includes a Japanese and Filipina, and this group, according to Dong, wants to go more cautiously on the site selection.


Council Secretary Ted Choi said some council members are reluctant to fully accept the goals of the corporation charter. He bases this on the absence of certain members of the Chong Wa faction from key meetings of the council -- such as meetings of the contractors -- and absence from visits to the proposed sites for the community center. Choi feels the council has difficulty reaching consensus, in part, because of differences as to the concept of the body prior to its formation.


""The longer we deliberate, the rising cost of acquisition and building will make it (the center) impossible to complete,"" Choi said.


Ling Mar, another council member said a feasibility study will be carried out on the site for the center. Mar said the site selection would be made within 30 days.


He declined to give a personal opinion regarding the site selection maintaining, ""there is no room for personal opinion when dealing with the public trust."" He said he would support ""whichever site best enhances the community.""


Howard Dong has offered to sell his property, now occupied by Mikies Tavern and Tamaya Restaurant, for the construction of a new building to house the center. The new structure would be four stories high.


According to Dong's estimates, the building would cost about $580,000. The total cost of the project, including site acquisition, would be about $818,000. Dong declined to comment on his site during the selection process.


By determining the amount of space to be rented by community organizations and retail outlets, the Dong building's income projection came to about $65,000 per year. No housing is planned for this building. With a possible 25-year loan at 6 1/2 per cent interest, the yearly payment would be about $42,000, leaving roughly $20,000 for operation costs. The estimated operating costs came to about $33,000 per year which would mean the building would lose $10,000 per year.


At a May 25 public hearing, the Bush Hotel was highly endorsed as a site for the community center by community representatives. The six story existing building which includes 160 units of occupied low income housing would continue as a housing facility, if it were chosen by the public corporation. According to Choi, no present tenant will be forced out and it will continue as a low income facility.


The cost of the purchase and renovation of the Bush would be about $1,125,000. But with retail space, community organization space and about 160 housing units rented out, the income on the property would reach about $175,000 per year.


With a 20-year loan at 6 1/2 per cent, the payment would be about $73,800 per year. Operating costs of $91,200 also subtracted from the income would . . . a net cash flow of approximately $10,000.


The public corporation will contract for a full economic feasibiliy study which is required by the city, since the corporation is a city body. It is not clear yet whether a study will be made of both sites, or just the Bush Hotel she, which appears to be more feasible at this time.


Although there is not strict time limit on purchase of the Bush, two other offers have been made to buy the Hotel, according to Shigeko Uno, manager of the property for the Rainier Heat and Power Trust, property owner. Bill Montgomery, trust executive, has given the public corporation priority on the purchase availability. The Trust expected an answer on the purchase of the property by the corporation by April 30 and it is a question how long the Trust will wait for the corporation.


The two other buyers both want to continue operating the hotel as a low income housing hotel, Uno said.


In other public corporation matters, Roy Mar resigned as vice chairperson.


Additionally, a motion made by Tak Kubota and seconded by Roy Mar at the May 5 meeting, was passed at the June 9 meeting. The motion states that during the first six months of the council, any officer or member at large of the Executive Committee can be subject to a vote of confidence or reelection by the members of the council. At the June 16 meeting, the vote of confidence was taken, but because of the absence of a quorum, none of the present officers were voted out.


At the same time, Tak Kubota was voted as new vice chairperson of the council.

Of the nine sites previously selected for a minipark play area by the Children's Minipark Committee, five will be submitted to the City Council for the final site selection. Once a letter of transmittal and the plans are submitted, the committee is hoping for a monetary allocation for park site acquisition and design.


The letter and plans will be sent to John Miller, Chairperson of Park and Public Grounds (Ted and Diana Bowers worked with Miller in the initial presenting of the miniparks project to the City Council in 1974).


The letter of transmittal presents all the data and survey research completed on the minipark/play area. It stresses that immediate action is necessary to avoid the imminent effects of the stadium and parking situations. Construction costs are on the rise and a safe area for children to play is becoming more essential in the ID.


The Parks Department will review the play area proposal. The ""committee will continue to monitor the Park Department's actions,"" said minipark committee member.


ID community support is assured for any one of the five selected park sites. Much preliminary planning has been completed by the Miniparks Committee. The next step depends on allocation of the necessary funds by appropriate sources in the very near future.

""There is no due process of law in the Philippines today,"" said Primitivo Mijares, former Philippine official, ""and the instant reaction to those who have caused embarrassment to the Marcos government is to have them placed in the stockade.""


Mijares testified here March 29 at an Immigration Department hearing on behalf of two Filipina maids threatened with deportation for fleeing their jobs with the Philippine Consul General in Seattle. The women, Francisca Abuel and Estelita Almirante are now seeking political asylum in the United States.


Mijares, who resides in the Bay Area, once served as Chairman of the Media Advisory Council, a licensing and censorship body for all media in the Philippines. He was employed under Marcos for 12 years before he became disillusioned with the martial law regime and became a refugee, seeking political asylum in the US in February, 1975.


He testified before the Federal Immigration Judge Newton Jnes that the two maids would be persecuted if they returned to the Philippines because those who cause embarassment to the Marcos government are routinely jailed without being charged or receiving legal counsel.


Bob Yamagiwa, defense attorney for the two women, contended that Consul General Julia Palarca used the Seattle Police Department to track down the two women on false charges of stealing jewelry. He also said Palarca would probably use the instrument of the Marcos government to persecute the two women for her own satisfaction if they were forced to return to the Philippines.


The case is now under the immigration judge's consideration and will be decided in a few weeks. The prosecuting attorney suggested that if the women were political opponents of Marcos or leftists their fear of persecution by the government would be more understandable. According to Judge Jones, hundreds of Filipinos are now seeking political asylum in the US.


At a talk at the Tyre iodge in Seattle, Mijares told members of the Filipino community about his experiences with the Marcos government. The former official received public attention when columnist Jack Anderson wrote that Marcos had attempted to bribe Mijares into not testifying before a US Congressional committee that the Philippine government is a dictatorship and that President Marcos ""methodically plotted to kill democracy.""


The bribe was in the form of a $50,000 check deposited in a San Francisco bank. Although the bribe was doubled, Mijares testified anyway.


""The landowners were paid off with worthless bonds which cannot be redeemed for five years, and even then it will be questionable,"" he told Seattle's Filipino community. Many members of the audience were concerned about the welfare of relatives in the Philippines or ownership of land which has been transferred from their hands during the land reform process.


When asked why he took part in the martial law government, Mijares admitted ""I believed that martial law would be the answer to the country's problems, but after two years I saw it was only an excuse to keep the president in power."" Marcos suspended national elections after his second presidential term expired three years ago.


""American corporations in the Philippines are pampered by Marcos at the expense of the Filipino people,"" Mijares charged. ""They are given tax incentives, the chance to repatriate profits and the go-ahead to give low wages to their workers in the Philippines."" Most workers earn about eight pesos or about $1 per day, he said.


Mijares also said American taxpayers' money is used by Marcos and his wife, Imelda, for lavish parties, resorts and other luxuries. City beautification projects are favored by Mrs. Marcos while residents suffer from poor housing or starvation.


Mijares has just completed a book about the Marcos government entitled ""The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda."" ""I am a fatalist,"" he said. ""After the book comes out and I have told my story about Marcos' injustices, I don't care what happens.""


""If I am forced to go back to the Philippines, I will be jailed and punished for sure,"" he said. Mijares own case with the immigration department has been held in limbo for over one year and a decision is still pending.


Speaking of the land reform program in the Philippines, Mijares called it a ""bogus reform, with its only objective to take the landowners from the provinces so they couldn't regroup and organize against Marcos.""


""Tourists are encouraged to visit the Philippines and spend money which in turn becomes part of the instrument to further repression in the Philippines,"" he said.

An ad hoc task force exploring the concept of an Asian women's health clinic agreed at a June 30 meeting to hold an Asian women's health fair sometime later this summer.


At the June 30 meeting, Wen Shaw, who has worked in a number of hospitals and clinics serving the bulk of the Asian population, reported having seen low numbers of Asian women.


Karen Matsuda cited low reported cancer rates for Asian women.


The group felt low rates of utilization of health care facilities by Asian women was not due to the lack of problems. The group agreed to work toward increasing knowledge and awareness of health care concerns among Asian women.


A survey to determine the interest and need for the women's clinic was recently completed. Bruce Miyahara, director of the International District Community Health Center, said the June 30 meeting was to collate information presented at an earlier meeting. The health fair, he said, will probably feature health screening, films, booths and displays. At that time, the task force will try to determine the interest in an Asian women's health clinic.


The next meeting of the task force was scheduled for July 13.

Cicada Arts Cooperative will feature the enamel and jewelry works of Tatsuki and Lenore Kobayashi and the weaving of Sally Wagner during the month of July. The public is invited to a preview opening Friday, June 25 from 5 to 9 p.m.


Kobayashi, originally from Nagano, Japan, and Lenore, of Seattle, are two of the few limoges enamel artists in the Northwest. The technique, which they learned from artist Lisal Salzer, is derived from a 16th century French enamel technique.


Tatsuki Kobayashi, who came to Seattle in 1958, will also be showing his silver, gold and brass jewelry designs. He has been designing jewelry for about 10 years, and enamels for about 7 years.


Lenore Kobayashi has designed authentic period costume paper dolls of American and European fashions. Some of her paper dolls are exhibited in the Pollack Toy Museum in London and the Harvard Graduate School of Design.


Tatsuki and Lenore now make their home in Everett.


Sally Wagner, a self-taught weaver originally from Seattle, studied at the University of Washington and worked at Magnolia Weaving. Wagner prefers to use natural fibers, wool, cotton and silk for her pillows, baby blankets, place mats and shawls.


""I like to make everyday things,"" Wagner said, ""things people will use."" She also will show hand woven cotton hand towels and purses.


Wagner, with a loom to demonstrate weaving, will let people try out the skill at the preview opening.

While the restaurant business in the district has generally profited from the thousands of stadium-goers, there are some businesses which have not.


""We had high expectations and hopes that the domed stadium would increase business,"" said Don Chin, owner of Sun May, a small gift shop on King Street, ""but it has helped very little.""


Chin, however, believes that the construction of the domed stadium has generally benefited business in the district, particularly the restaurants. He said, ""It helps bring people down here.""


Chin, past president and presently a board member of Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, has his own formula about how to develop the area. ""To make any Chinatown, Japanese, or Filipino Town,"" he said, ""the people themselves must live there.""


Stockton, California, has a new Chinatown and half the stores are empty, he said, because ""there's not a single Chinese that lives there, there's only shops."" Los Angeles' new Chinatown experienced a similar situation, he noted. ""They built a new Chinatown there 20 years ago and then people moved away."" Business in that Chinatown is not as good as elsewhere, according to Chin.


Successful Chinatowns, like New York's or San Francisco's, have a Chinese population within the area, he noted. When he walked around in San Francisco's Chinatown, he found that 80 to 90 per cent of the customers are Chinese, not tourists. ""The area was all Chinese and the buildings are owned by Chinese. They built a town by themselves.""


Chin said, ""The city must help revitalize the area and provide housing for the district.""


When asked about the future of the area, Chin said that he does not envision any drastic change in the near future. ""We don't have any rich Chinese,"" he said. The district's up-coming beautification program won't do anything in the short-run, he said, but maybe in the long-run.


Chin expressed hope that some of the underutilized store fronts on King Street will be better utilized for business rather than storage or some other use (a criticism noted by several economic reports on the area). He said that the underutilization was the result of the lack of co-operation between the owners and merchants, and business practices.


If there were full utilization of the King Street for businesses, he said, business in the area would improve.

A Narcisco-Perez Legal Defense Committee has been established here to provide support and money for two Filipina nurses arrested in Michigan.


The nurses, Filipina B. Narcisco and Leonora M. Peres, were charged with five counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of poisoning, and conspiracy to commit murder while working at a hospital in Ann Arbor.


Both women have pleaded innocent to the alleged crimes.


The defense committee, one of several throughout the country, was initiated by the Filipina Nurses Association of Seattle, but also consists of members from the recently formed Asian Nurses Coalition.


In an article in the October issue of the International Drop-In Center newsletter, Sister Heide Parreno, a spokesperson for the committee and International District Health Clinic coordinator, said the nurses ""deserve a just and fair trial,"" which requires a large amount of money. The cost for the defense, she wrote, would be over $350,000.


According to Sister Heide, ""The Legal Defense Committee in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the Pilipino Nurses Association in Chicago believe that the case against these two nurses is largely circumstantial.


""Two principal witnesses for the prosecution appear to be unreliable, one gave testimony under hypnosis and the other contradicted himself and changed his statement several times.


""These nurses were interrogated on various occasions once for six hours straight -- without benefit of legal counsel. They have also been allegedly harrassed and pressured to confess by FBI agents and the Ann Arbor V.A. hospital administration.


""They have appeared in handcuffs and chained together in newspapers and on television all over the country. And yet these women are by law presumed to be innocent.""


The trial is expected to begin on January 4.


Defense donations can be sent to Mrs. Rose DeGarcia, c/o Filipino Nurses Association, 8430 S.E. 35th Ave., Mercer Island, Wash Checks should be made out to the Narcisco-Perez Defense Committee.


For further information, contact Sister Heide at 622-9650 or 634-0819, or DeGarcia at 626-6200.

The International District farmers market which ended October 24 was a complete success. Plans are now being formulated for running the market as a self-sustaining organization next year.


The purpose of the market was to provide District residents a conveniently located place to buy fresh, low-cost vegetables and fruits, so they would not have to go all the way downtown to the Pike Place Market. The market was held on Maynard Ave., between King and Jackson St.


The Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA) began organizing community support for the farmers' market through petitions and media and personal contacts. Actual organizing began in early. May, when I was named coordinating director and Nemesio Domingo, funding director.


The International District farmers market opened for business August 7, in conjunction with the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce Seafair activity. On opening day, three farmers were in attendance. This first week was the only week the market stayed open until 5 p.m., rain plagued the grand opening.


During the next 11 Saturdays, the market closed between noon and 1 p.m., primarily because everything was sold out. During the second week, Jeff Sakuma, a Rainier Beach High School senior, was named co-director of the market. Susan Alfonzo and Michael Cruz also worked as volunteers.

In Hing Hay Park, approximately 150 Asians, young and old, gathered to celebrate May Day. The weather was good and the festivities included food and speakers.


May 1 was a day of paying tribute to Asian workers throughout the country, workers who have been involved in the battle to achieve decent low-income housing, full employment, workers' rights and good education.


Chris Mensalvas, Sr., one of the principal speakers for the afternoon, said, ""Chinese Americans in the Pacific Northwest enabled the railroads to penetrate the Cascades. Japanese on the West Coast produced food."" And, he said, the Filipinos worked in the fields.


Yet all these contributions led, he said, to ""race riots, deportation...and rounding up of men, women and children in concentration camps in World War II.""


He then related his experiences upon arriving in Seattle in 1927. His first meals were hot cakes -- for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Mensalvas encountered ""wall-beds"" for the first time. He began organizing workers into independent labor unions, thus raising the hourly pay and making employment in the salmon industry more acceptable for workers today.


Mrs. Aki Kurose, who spoke about the labor market after the Japanese relocation of World War II, commented on the disbursement of the Japanese. The Japanese, she said, had ""less power, less impact -- less threat of organization."" They were forced into menial low-paying jobs and were pitted against other minorities and became a ""tool of the capitalist,"" stated Mrs. Kurose. She said that even today, the government constantly intervenes and disrupts minority communities, and without communities, ""there is no solidarity.""


They day's program continued with songs about Asian workers' struggles in this country.


Michael Kozu spoke on the July 4 Coalition to expose the Bicentennial ""fraud"" and show the real history of the country.

Public Corporation meetings can be informative and entertaining, to say the least. Take, for instance, their July 21 meeting.


The July 21 meeting was billed as both constituency and regular council meetings, but neither group showed up in sufficient numbers for a quorum. So, Chairperson Ben Woo announced to the gathering of eight constituents (two more came later) and three other council members that the meeting would be conducted ""without business transaction.""


Anyway, the meeting started innocently enough with Ted Choi, council secretary, reading the minutes of the last constituency meeting four months earlier. At that meeting, the constituents agreed on one evening meeting per month, but apparently the council thought that wasn't a good idea. Quarterly meetings, according to corporation's guidelines, are all that is required.


Consultant Chosen


After reading the minutes, Choi informed the audience the ""alphabet group"" (MCS-TPG, meaning Management Consultant Services -- The Planning Group) had been selected as consultant for the multi-service center feasibility study. Woo added that a conditional purchase agreement had been made with the Bush Hotel and Howard Dong properties, both of which have been mentioned as possible sites for the center.


""The preliminary feasibility study to determine which of the two are more feasible,"" Woo said, ""will be completed three weeks after the contract with alphabet group is signed."" (The council reached an agreement with MCS-TPG for the study to the tune of some $18,000 at its July 28 meeting).


That's where the regular run-of-the-mill meeting ended and where the ""hidden agenda showed itself.


Motives Question


At that point, Bob Santos, director of Inter*im, raised his hand. In no uncertain terms, he questioned the motives of certain council members and charged that some of their actions had impeded the corporation's progress.


Santos alluded to time wasted by the council in removing Tomio Moriguchi and James Young from the council's executive committee. He also said the council ""should begin moving on the multi-service center project before the City Council takes the $385,000 away.""


""What is the interest of each individual member of the council?"" Santos demanded to know.


""My record speaks for itself,"" Council Vice-chairperson Tak Kubota replied, obviously shaken. ""I have 20 years working in the community. In a public meeting, we should refrain from certain language that is not appropriate. I have no axes to grind, no vested interest, no property in the district...""


Kubota Took the Stand


""What is the interest of each individual member of the council,"" Bob Santos demanded to know.


And for the next 20 minutes, the meeting resembled a trial. Kubota was the first council member to take the stand. He proceeded to carry on a dialogue between himself and the audience.


One constituent asked, ""If we (the community) are working together to improve the community, why were Tomio and James Young removed?


""The voting of confidence had to be done for a change,"" Kubota responded. ""Uh, votes of confidence needs clarification. We did not know how they (Moriguchi and Young) would be like... They voted the same way...""


""What do you see as your role? Are all the council members for low-income housing?""


""I can't speak for the other council members,"" Kubota said. ""In the past five years, I played a role in a project for the elderly...""


""I take full responsibility,"" Kubota answered, in reference to the votes of no confidence.


""I'm alarmed that eight members of the council are not present,"" another person said. ""It is the public duty of the council members to bring back the opinions of the constituents to the council members not here.""


""We've been meeting every week since the beginning of the year, sometimes twice a week. Many of the council members are busy...""


""If council members can't come to the evening meetings,"" said another equally disturbed woman, ""they shouldn't be on the council.""


Why Liem Tuai?


""Why did the council chose (as their legal advisor) an attorney (Liem Tuai) who voted against the center?""


""It wasn't brought up,"" said Woo, who by now had picked up on the barrage of questions.


""We wanted to hire an Asian,"" Kubota added.


And so it went.


The feelings of the constituents can be summed up by the remarks of one of them, Elaine Ko, who suggested that ""votes of confidence should be made by the constituents.""


Council on Trial


The public corporation council was on trial. The constituents wanted information about the council's actions. That is why they came and that is one of the main purposes of the constituency meetings. In that sense, the meeting was no different from others in the past.


What was different, and alarming, were the questions being asked and the responses to them. The constituents in fact, questioned the very basic motives and actions of the council. Some of their questions were answered, some partially, and some were not.


Need Constituent's Trust


The council needs to gain the confidence and trust of its constituents, if it is to be accountable and responsive. It can begin by showing up for the constituency meetings rather than to get second or third-hand gossip.


But, the constituents must also be responsive and they too must earn the respect of the council. As chairperson Woo put it, the situation works both ways. Both the constituents and the council must attend the meetings in order to gain each others' respect.


The burden, however, is on the council. They are the ones chosen to accomplish the goals of the corporation. They can only gain the confidence and trust of the people by taking positive and concrete steps, in a timely manner to preserve and enhance the district.

The membership of the International Special Review District Board is now complete with the Mayor's appointment of two new members last month. The Examiner applauds the Board's hard work over the past year in drawing up guidelines for physical development in the District. We hope that the Board continues to take a firm position so that the District will not degenerate into a mess of clashing neon signs and cheap tacky store facades.


It's not easy for the Board to deal with angry individual property and business owners who feel that in America one can do what one wants with his/her private property. The Board has made a genuine attempt to assist in the development of a community in which business and residential interests are compatible.


However, there is something missing on the Board. Where is the representation of residents? The enabling ordinance #102455 passed by City Council to form the Board was a response to community outcry over the impending impact of the Domed Stadium. The Council, recognizing that the District is both a business and residential community stipulated that the Board be composed of five elected and two appointed members. The five elected members must include two business or property owners or employees, two residents or community participants and one at-large member. It further states that with the two appointments, the Mayor ""must attempt to assure that the Board represents legitimate District interests.""


The Mayor should have used the opportunity of appointing two new members in January to designate resident representation on the Board. There are no women in the membership either, and only one Filipino sits on this important review body.


We hope that the Board will take every opportunity to make up for the lack of official representation from District residents by striving to fairly address the interests of residents. If they don't, the Board will lose credibility in the eyes of many people concerned with the District.

An off-street parking plan now under study by the International District Economic Association may for the first time organize parking for employees and residents of the area. A survey is now being conducted to find out how many owners of parking lots in the District are interested in participating in a plan to consolidate parking spaces for use by employees and residents in off-business evening hours.


""Response to IDEA's community parking plan has been astounding,"" said an IDEA spokesman, ""It is proof that the business community here sees the need for cooperative efforts to improve the District.""


So far twelve lots in the core area out of 73 lots of all sizes in the District have been added to the plan:


Bush Garden


Inter*im


Jimmy Woo


KCW Furniture


Officemporium


Rainier Bank


Seattle First National Bank


Seventh Avenue ServiceStation


Terry Toda


Tom Chin


United Savings and Loan

Residents and employees will be served by the plan first, and will be expected to rent spaces on a monthly basis, but the remaining stalls will be rented to patrons of the area on an hourly or daily basis.


Those residents or employees who are now seeking parking spaces may call Inter*im to reserve a space in the parking plan. The plan may be administered by an International District parking authority or cooperative, according to IDEA.

The Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) is investigating possible violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in the elimination of the last bilingual Asian caseworker position funded under the State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS).


Virginia Balderrama, of HEW's Office for Civil Rights, told the Examiner her office is looking at whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which requires equal access to services for welfare recipients under federally-assisted programs, was violated.


Luke Leung, Pioneer Square Public Assistance Office caseworker, was told in February that his position, funded by DSHS, would be eliminated March 15 and that he would be rehired into a project position. Leung, operating out of the Chinese Information Center, did community outreach work, providing assistance to Chinese welfare recipients who have trouble with the English language.


DSHS was also funding bilingual caseworker positions for a Filipino, Japanese and Korean, but the persons filling those positions left their jobs and those positions were never refilled.


""The whole program is going to be wiped out,"" Leung said. ""The Chinese recipients who come in will no longer get any service.""


Leung said the elimination of his position is part of a general cutback in social services area affecting 200 persons. Those persons will be rehired into project positions. Leung pointed out that DSHS is operating under the concept of ""last hired, first fired.""


DSHS's Minority Affairs Office is presently conducting an investigation into the elimination of the Asian caseworker positions.


Balderama said HEW would review the Minority Affairs findings and see whether adequate bilingual services are being provided for Asian clients. She said, however, from the information she has on the DSHS cutbacks, ""we have as close to a prima facie case (for violation of Title VI) as we've had.""

Terraces will be cut in along the hill-side behind International Terrace by Ohno Landscape Company to begin the International District Community Garden ""very soon."" The use of a land dozer is being donated by Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation.


The terraces initiated construction of an Inter*im-sponsored hillside garden to serve the low-income, elderly in the International District, according to Darlyn Rundberg, project coordinator.


The garden, being built almost entirely with donated materials and services from throughout Seattle, was organized through the use of ""seed money"" in the form of a grant from the Hunger Action Center. Rundberg points out that construction of the garden requires the donated labor of residents and those concerned with the International District community.


""And,"" Rundberg notes, ""Inter*im is currently contracting with the City of Seattle Summer Youth Employment Program for a 10-member crew of youngsters to assist us as we build our garden.""


Railroad ties and utility poles will make up retaining walls to hold the terraces. To develop a good garden soil, house manure from Longacres will be rotovated with existing clay and 300 cubic yards of sand.


Inter*im is currently receiving applications from those who wish to garden. Gardeners qualify by low-income status and age. Those who qualify for the meal voucher program qualify to use the garden. Garden plots will range in size due to the irregular geometry of the site. It is hoped that the gardens will average 300 square feet and that about 40 plots will be available.


This year, no charge will be made to low-income elderly who use the garden. It is hoped this can remain a free activity through establishment of a ""garden sustaining fund.""


According to Rundberg, construction of the garden is expected to end about the beginning of August, in time for planting winter garden crops.


""Anyone wishing to assist with the building of the garden or wishing to donate funds or materials will be warmly welcomed,"" Rundberg says. ""It is a monumental task which requires all the energy the community can muster. Already a work party of 10 has completed the initial clearing of the site.


""It is expected that hauling of the poles and timbers donated to date will occur during the week of June 14.


Assistance is now being sought for the loading and unloading of these retaining materials.""


Anyone wishing to participate should contact Darlyn Rundberg at Inter*im, phone 624-1802.

Kobe Terrace Park, a city government construction job, is nearing completion and no Asians have been hired to work on the site. Is this contrary to affirmative action guidelines for government funding projects?


The Alaskan Cannery Workers Association (ACWA) complained about this problem last November. They claim that originally the job site was to have three minorities but the work force was reduced because of a change in the budget and the result was that only one minority was required on the site out of a total crew of six workers.


""They didn't even comply with that,"" said Rod Mamon, spokesman for ACWA recently, ""they just had one black truckdriver for a couple of days.""


-- Spragues' Replies --


Spragues' Incorporated, the Lynnwood commercial landscaping firm constructing the park, protested that it is a union company, and has exhausted every procedure to hire an Asian within the bounds of its agreement with the Local 440 Laborers Union. If no Asians are in the union hall then there will be none on the job site, the company told Mamon.


In a January letter to the Park Department on the matter Harry Moore. Vice President of Spragues Incorporated stated that they had not failed to comply with the City's affirmative action ordinance, in fact, they had ""gone overboard in the opposite direction.""


Moore was unavailable for further comment.


The City's Human Rights Department said that it is keeping a watch on the site to see that the work crew of six includes one minority. The ethnic background of the one minority is not specified.


-- Must Hire Minorities --


Nate Sanders, Contract Compliance Administrator for the Human Rights Department said the contractor must comply with the City's guideline on hiring minorities even if it means going outside the union hall. The penalty for non-compliance, according to Sanders, is a stop on the payroll from the City to the firm.


The Cannery Workers Association contends that Asians should be hired on construction sites in the District, whether or not they are found in the union hiring hall.


However, the City, Sanders said, cannot specity which minority is hired on the job. He suggested that the minority community in which the job is to be done should take the responsibility to get their workers into the union hall in order to be hired on the site. Additionally, the community should monitor the bid specitications and contract agreements between the company which has been awarded a contract in their community and the City. If it is monitored from the outset problems in the hiring of preferred minorities may be avoided according to the Human Rights representative.


-- Develop Mechanism --


ACWA admits that the job is really too small and too near completion to warrant a site shut-down or lawsuit to protest the lack of Asians hired on the site. But in the future with government jobs in the District there should be a mechanism developed to force contractors to hire Asians According to Mamon Asians should be hired on private construction jobs as well as government jobs.


""It should be easier for the small private jobs to comply since most of them are non-union companies and they don't have to hire through the union,"" Mamon said.


The organization suggested that the International Special Review District Board should consider this problem since it must review all construction projects in the District.


Because of the Block Grant tunded streetscaping project which will start construction some time in late April the issue of equal work opportunity for Asian construction workers will soon become crucial.

The City Building Department has agreed to extend the deadline for bringing the Milwaukee Hotel into compliance with the Housing Code. But the King Street hotel, which houses a number of Chinese families, may still be forced to close unless money to pay for the necessary upgrading is found.


On October 28 and November 4, Milwaukee Hotel tenants and International District Housing Alliance (IDHA) representatives met with City Building Department officials.


Jordan Wong and Don Louie, co-owners of the Milwaukee Hotel, had been served a housing code ""notice of violation"" on October 5.


At the two meetings, Wong and architect George Lucker requested an extension of the February 5 deadline for correcting the hotel's violations of code.


C.F. Hester, the City's superintendent for conservation and abatement, told Wong and Lucker the code violations he was most concerned about were the lack of heat, unsafe wiring, and litter and debris in public areas.


Housing Inspector N. Vance said, ""Even February is an exorbitant time (for the tenants) to live without heat and with unsafe wiring.""


Bob Santos, director of the International District Improvement Association (Inter*im), said his organization wanted the city to grant an extension to the owners so that, in the meanwhile, a financial plan for renovation could be worked out. The owners have said the cost of renovation might exceed $300,000, which is more than they can afford.


Santos said the owners could possibly lease the building to the International District Public Corporation which, in turn, could take up the burden of seeking housing rehabilitation funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.


The tenants and supporters fear the owners may be forced to sell the hotel, because of the cost of renovation. The approximately 50 tenants would then have to search for new housing outside the International District.


In an October 19 letter to Mayor Wes Uhlman, Santos wrote, ""The burning questions on our minds are: How many more hotel closures threaten our District? Where is the alternative housing for displaced residents?""


At the October 28, meeting, Karen Chan, a junior high school student and representative of the Milwaukee Hotel Tenants Council, told city officials that her family has lived in Seattle for four years and that it is difficult to find inexpensive housing in the International District.


Mrs. Wong, another Milwaukee Hotel tenant, speaking in Cantonese, said she would like the owners to fix up the hotel. She said that, without a car, she has to take a bus to go anywhere.


""The Chinese don't know English,"" she said, ""and they want to live in China-town.""


Ken Wong Mar, of the IDHA, told Hester the City shouldn't require upgrading of the Milwaukee Hotel unless it was also willing to provide funding for it. Mar asked Hester if he should write a letter to the mayor.


""I will assure you,"" Hester said, ""the mayor is very concerned about housing.""


Mar asked Hester if he would write a letter expressing concern that money is provided for upgrading the hotel.


""That does not fall within my function,"" Hester replied, ""and I will not do so.""


Hester, when he met with Jordan Wong, Lucker, the tenants and supporters again November 4, agreed to recommend to the Superintendent of Buildings that the deadline for correcting three violations be extended to May 5, and certain requirements for doors and locks be met by July 5.


The IDHA has met recently with James Mason and Bill Vivian, both from the City Department of Community Development. Mar said both expressed interest in trying to get the Public Corporation to take up renovation of the Milwaukee Hotel.


In a letter to Public Corporation Chairperson Ben Woo, Jordan Wong and Don Louie said they have been meeting with Inter*im and the Housing Alliance and have agreed to work together with those organizations to seek funding sources for renovation of the hotel.


""It is our hope,"" the co-owners stated, ""that with your assistance, we can realize a positive alternative for the hotel other than the pending eviction of the current residents.""

The Upholsterers' International Union, Local 6, has not yet responded to the recent written request of the Seattle Chinese Media Committee for a copy of its garment worker contract.


The Media Committee, in late September, was granted over 200 dollars by the United Garment Workers Union, Local 17 to translate its new three-year contract into Chinese and print 300 copies for distribution. The Chinese contract was made available to those attending the November 14 garment worker conference at the Chinese Information Center.


Media Committee representatives say they want to translate the Upholsterers' International contract as well, since the union represents a significant number of Chinese workers who do not understand English.


Betty Tsang, a member of the Media Committee, told the Examiner that she called the Upholsterers' International office and was told by a woman on the other line that the Media Committee letter had been referred to the union's lawyers who told them not to grant the request for a contract. Tsang said the woman hung up on her.


When the Examiner called the union, a woman on the other line, who refused to identify herself, said that Al Gord, the business and international representative, was out of town until after Thanks-giving and that the contract could not be given out without his approval.


""I wish they (they Chinese) would go to school and they would be educated,"" the woman added.


The woman said she did not see the need for the translation. ""I've been here 26 years and I know them (the Chinese workers) and they know me. I don't care if they've only been in this country two months; I understand them and they understand me.


""I know a lot more about the Chinese (than the Chinese Media Committee),"" she said. ""Of course, every country has a few stinkers. But the Chinese are nice people.""

Asian bilingual caseworker Luke Leung has retained his position with the State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) despite a Thurston County Superior Court ruling in late April that selective certification, which the state used in Leung's case, cannot be used to rehire in a layoff situation.


Investigation Continues


Meanwhile, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) is continuing its investigation into whether DSHS is violating Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by not providing adequate bilingual services staff to help Asian welfare recipients.


The court ruled, on the basis of a 1960 state civil services law, that rehiring must be done solely on the basis of seniority when there have been layoffs, the position of the Washington Federation of State Employees which opposed Leung's rehiring and took the state to court.


The court enjoined the state from using selective certification based on special skills or racial membership in hiring when there has been a reduction in force. But since the court's ruling does not have any effect on past actions, Leung can retain his present position.


Leung, operating out of the Chinese Information Center providing assistance to Chinese welfare recipients, was rehired into a project position in March during an overall cutback in the number os social services staff. Leung was rehired back following complaints that Leung's position was crucial since he was the only bilingual caseworker servicing the needs of the Chinese welfare recipients who had difficulty with the English language.


Somewhat Favorable


Leung said the court ruling is ""somewhat favorable"" because it forces DSHS to plan ahead of time to see how Asian caseworkers, with less seniority than others in the department, can be protected during layoffs.


Leung noted, however, that the union did win in court and that as a result of the court ruling the state cannot hire a Japanese or a Korean bilingual caseworker. Beside Leung, there is presently one Filipino bilingual caseworker.


He said he pointed this out in a June 8 meeting he had with a representative of HEW's Office for Civil Rights, with which he filed a complaint in March.


Mitsuye Mijara, Equal Opportunity Specialist for HEW, told the Examiner that her office is exploring the impact of DSHS's staff cutbacks on Asian welfare clients.


Frank Irigon, who prepared an impact statement on the cutback of Asians in the department for DSHS's Minority Affairs, Office, said, ""His (Leung's) position should be protected. Whether he should be reclassified, I don't know.


Another Case


Anne Ellington, State Human Rights Commission attorney, told the Examiner of a court case, Braybant vs. Seattle, in which selective certification involved in the city's affirmative action program was upheld. She called it ""a very strong case for selectively certifying to maintain affirmative action.""


The case, she said, involved a white employee named Braybant who was passed over for promotion to foreman in the engineering department. The position went, instead, to a person with a Spanish surname.


She said the case is set for argument in the State Supreme Court in fall. She warned that there is no decision yet as to whether a reverse quota system can be used to retain laid off members of a minority group over whites with more seniority.""

The first construction phase of the hillside community garden project, sponsored by the International District Improvement Association (Inter*im), is approaching completion after four months of labor.


The garden, located near 7th Ave. and s. Washington, will eventually be tended by and provide food for the low-income elderly living in the District.


Six students have been hired through Inter*im to help install retaining walls. Railroad fies will hold the soil on the terrace site from sliding when the winter rains begin.


The next phase of construction involves making pathways, the walls and laying water and drainage lines. Next, sand and horse manure will be mixed with the clay on the site. This will provide the garden's topsoil.


The final stage will be construction of compost bins, a picnic table and clearing rocks.


Inter*im hopes to begin planting early next spring. Anyone interested in donating labor or materials should call Garden Coordinator Glenn Takagi at Inter*im, 624-1802.

Old Chinatown down on Washington St. is now history. It's been dead for some fifty years, long enough for many to have forgotten or to have not been told about it.


Only a chipped wooden board with cracked and faded Chinese characters sitting above the balcony of an old, blighted building on the corner of Second Ave and South Washington St. remains. It is the only visible reminder of the Chinese quarters and the entire settlement area that was once there.


For some 60 years, old Chinatown served as home for early Chinese immigrants in Seattle Chinese enterprises grew rapidly to accomodate an increasing immigrant population.


Chin Hock First


Chin Hock is on record as the First Chinese resident of Seattle, although there might have been others who arrived at the same time or possibly earlier. He came here in 1860, and began as a domestic worker, just nine years after the first white settler, Arthur Denny, landed at Alki Point.


In 1867, Chen Cheong began manufacturing cigars on Commercial St. (now Occidental Ave.) He earned the distinction of being the first Chinese to begin a business in this city. This was also the first cigar business in what was then Washington Territory.


One year later, Chin Hock with his savings, began a general merchandising store in which cigars were manufactured. The Wa Chong Company, as it was called, opened next to the tideflats just south of Henry Yesler's sawmill on the foot of Mill St. (Yesler Way). The store advertised that it manufactured cigars and sold sugar, tea, and Chinese goods. Some years later, the company advertised an additional commodity, opium, apparently legal at the time.


Labor Contracting


Chin Hock, taking advantage of the growing Chinese population and the need for workers, also became a labor contractor His company advertised as a ""Chinese Intelligence Office,"" asking anyone wishing to employ Chinese to contact the company.


According to the 1870 census 234 Chinese resided in the territory, but only a few of those in Seattle. Most were in Eastern Washington seeking gold. The Chinese followed the trail of white miners from California, working their abandoned mines. With the depletion of gold mines in Eastern Washington, many headed west of the Cascades to the Puget Sound region to work on railroads, in coal mines, on hop farms, in lumber mills, and in the fishing industry.


Some eventually ended up in Seattle By 1873, there were 100 Chinese among the city's 2,000 inhabitants.


More Chinese


As the economy of the city grew, more Chinese, arrived in Seattle through other ports. Some came here through Port Townsend, where the U.S. customs house was located. Others came via Port Gamble and Port Blakely, where they had worked in lumber mills. In 1974, the first boat run between China and Seattle began. Some Chinese came here from points as far south as Portland, and as far north as Canada.


In 1876, the city's population reached 3,400, with the number of Chinese at 250. There was an additional ""floating"" population of 300, representing a transient Chinese labor force contracted to various work sites around Seattle.


Until the mid-1870's, Chinatown served as a base for the transient Chinese merchants. Thereafter, a commercial-residential area developed as increasing numbers of Chinese found work in the city.


From Mill Street


Meanwhile, the Chinese quarters gradually moved from the Occidental-Mill St. area to Washington St., between Second and Third Ave.


Chin Hock moved his prosperous business to Third and Washington St. in the middle of the 1870's. Soon thereafter, other Chinese merchants leased buildings along Washington St. from wealthy white property owners.


The new location quickly became congested. ""In 1877, Washington Street was Chinese Headquarters,"" wrote Clarence Bagley, the late University of Washington history professor. ""On that street there were twenty-seven Chinese houses in about a half a block.... During any alarm of fire they poured out like rats from a burning house.""


Variety of Occupations


The Chinese engaged in a variety of occupations. Some worked in small businesses owned and operated by Chinese merchants. These small laundries, restaurants, and dry goods stores were patronized by whites and Indians as well as Chinese. The Indians, in fact, regularly patronized the dry goods stores and some Chinese employees learned. Indian sign language and Siwash (an Indian language).


Other Chinese peddled vegetables planted at either of two gardens: one in the northern section of town on what is now the Seattle Center, and the other on the Duwamish River, south of the city's commercial area. Some worked in factories while others became domestic laborers. Still others found jobs in lumber mills. Some worked on public work projects such as street paving, some engaged in net fishing in Elliot Bay. There was even one Chinese who peddled ice cream on a converted wheelbarrow.


Church School Established


In 1882, a school for Chinese children was established at the Methodist Episcopal Church at Fourth ave, and Columbia St. About 40 children attended the classes.


Economic conditions grew worst in the early 1880's and antagonism toward Chinese increased. By the time of the anti-Chinese riots in Seattle, in 1885 and 1886, there were about 400 Chinese in the city, a small increase in 10 years. This was because of antagonism towards the Chinese and the decrease of job opportunities in the surrounding areas. The passage of the first Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 was, of course, the primary reason for the limited growth.


After the riots, only a handful of Chinese remained in the city. But, two years later, when economic conditions had improved, about 300 Chinese were residing in the area from which they had been driven not very long ago.


First Brick Building


During the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, the Chinese quarters burned down. To insure the future safety of his business, Chin Gee Hee, a wealthy merchant and labor contractor, had the first brick building in the city erected after the fire.


In the absence of Chinese associations, the small number of Chinese general stores provided needed services to assist the immigrants. These stores served as boarding houses and meeting places. Laborers would sleep above the stores in designated rooms and the family and relatives of the merchants slept in other rooms. Cooking facilities were available and meals served for a small fee. At the stores, gossip, news, employment opportunities, and general information were exchanged.


For restless sojourners, those living in the stores and those who came to town from their work sites, the stores provided gambling facilities. Generally, those who used the facilities of a particular store had the same surname.


In 1900, there were 434 recorded Chinese in Seattle, but this figure jumped to 924 by 1910.


The Move to King St.


""Old Chinatown was getting too crowded, so they began moving up here to King Street,"" said Willard Jue, a 71-year-old retired botanist.


Immediately after the re-surfacing of King St., which began in 1907 as part of the Jackson Street Regrade Project, a Chinese investment group built a series of buildings on the south side from Eighth Ave to Maynard Ave., Jue said In 1909, Goon Dip, the honorary Chinese Consulate and labor contractor, built the Milwaukee Hotel on King Street.


The 1913 International Chinese Business Directory of the World, published in San Francisco, listed 41 businesses in Seattle's old Chinatown. These included. 28 General merchandising stores, two laundries, three associations, two restaurants, one drug store, two Chinese and Japanese bazaars, two ladies underwear shops, and one bird and goldfish store.


Most of these stores and the Chinese living in old Chinatown gradually moved to the King Street area during the next decade.


Final Blow


The final blow to old Chinatown came when the city decided to create the Second Avenue Extension in the mid-1920's. ""Streets down there were at an angle,"" Jue said. ""The traffic to the Union Railway Station became too heavy and so they decided to make the streets leading to the terminal straight. The Extension cut through the middle of Chinatown.""


After 1925, only a handful of Chinese stores and a few Chinese remained in old Chinatown. ""There was only one legitimate business down there."" Jue said, ""and that was a family association."" The only thing down there was gambling, he said.


""The stores sold cigarettes as a front. Lottery tickets were sold to Caucasians and Chinese would go down there to gamble in the back rooms.""


By World War II, all the stores of old Chinatown had closed. The area is now considered part of Pioneer Square. But somehow, that name doesn't seem right because the area is missing a very important pioneer flavor that will never be replaced.

Two Christian relief workers who left Vietnam one year after the former Saigon regime fell in April, 1975, said recently that they never heard of any people forced to leave the city and go to the countryside after the war ended.


Jim Klassen and Max Ediger members of the Mennonite Central Committee, presented a ""Vietnam Interpretation"" to about 75 people at the University of Washington October 21.


Klassen said there was an ""amazingly smooth transition"" from the American supported government to the Communist government. The transition was so smooth, he said, that the people in Saigon never lost their electricity. Few soldiers carrying guns were seen on the streets, he said.


Klassen commented that barbed wire, one of the symbols of the war, finally came down. ""We were able,"" he said, ""to travel on streets we were never able to travel on before.""


Ediger, who did work in community development with students in Quang Ngai Province in the Central Highlands, said the new government's goal was to encourage half of Saigon's population to go to the countryside.


Prior to the change in government, Ediger said, the United States was shipping 400,000 metric tons of rice per year to South Vietnam. Now, without the American aid, the country was not producing enough rice.


Some left the countryside, Ediger said, because they could not find jobs in Saigon and some left because they had relatives living there.


""We did not,"" he remarked, ""hear of any people forced (to leave the city) in the sense of people coming in and taking over the house and saying, 'You have to go.


Klassen said there was fear that after the Saigon regime collapsed, ""Maybe all the people would withdraw into their houses and draw their shutters."" That was not the case, he said.


Klassen and Ediger said they were surprised by the amount of freedom under the Communists.


In response to a question, Ediger said, ""The only thing I can say is that I witnessed no executions during the year I was there (in Saigon). I heard of no executions or anything of that kind.""


Klassen added that he did not hear of persons sent to re-education camps mistreated. He said he had two friends in re-education camps.


""They didn't speak very angrily about it,"" he said. Klassen said they studied government, economics and history, and tended gardens while they were there.


Klassen, who taught congregational Bible study classes in Saigon, said churches kept right on meeting. There were not soldiers coming to disrupt the meetings, he said. The meetings had to be registered, he said, but it only took several days for the director of the center in his area to register his meetings.

In Hing Hay Park, approximately 150 Asians, young and old, gathered to celebrate May Day. The weather was good and the festivities included food and speakers.


May 1 was a day of paying tribute to Asian workers throughout the country, workers who have been involved in the battle to achieve decent low-income housing, full employment, workers' rights and good education.


Chris Mensalvas, Sr., one of the principal speakers for the afternoon, said, ""Chinese Americans in the Pacific Northwest enabled the railroads to penetrate the Cascades. Japanese on the West Coast produced food."" And, he said, the Filipinos worked in the fields.


Yet all these contributions led, he said, to ""race riots, deportation...and rounding up of men, women and children in concentration camps in World War II.""


He then related his experiences upon arriving in Seattle in 1927. His first meals were hot cakes -- for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Mensalvas encountered ""wall-beds"" for the first time. He began organizing workers into independent labor unions, thus raising the hourly pay and making employment in the salmon industry more acceptable for workers today.


Mrs. Aki Kurose, who spoke about the labor market after the Japanese relocation of World War II, commented on the disbursement of the Japanese. The Japanese, she said, had ""less power, less impact -- less threat of organization."" They were forced into menial low-paying jobs and were pitted against other minorities and became a ""tool of the capitalist,"" stated Mrs. Kurose. She said that even today, the government constantly intervenes and disrupts minority communities, and without communities, ""there is no solidarity.""


They day's program continued with songs about Asian workers' struggles in this country.


Michael Kozu spoke on the July 4 Coalition to expose the Bicentennial ""fraud"" and show the real history of the country.

The proposed bilingual education plan for the Seattle Public Schools does not meet all requirements set forth to implement a court decision on special instruction for non-English speaking students, an Asian attorney has charged.


The Seattle Public School Board is negotiating staff transfers and a bilingual education plan with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to reach an agreement in compliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Lau vs. Nichols Supreme Court decision.


Prohibit Segregation


The federal act prohibits racial segregation in staff assignments and requires the schools to take into account the needs of non-English speaking students. Further, the court decision requires school districts with high concentrations of non-English speaking students to provide special instruction for those students.


The staff transfer plan, previously negotiated in Washington, D.C. between the School Board and the Civil Rights Office of HEW, came under fire from the Central Area School Council and Washington State Senators Warren Magnuson and Henry Jackson. The Council pointed out that the plan, providing for the exchange of white and minority teachers to equalize minority staffing within the district, would mean the loss of minority staff members in the Central Area next fall.


Under the transfer plan, white and minority certified staff personnel, 280 teachers and 20 principals, would be transferred in September. According to Tony Orange, chairperson of the Central Area School Council, half of the Central Area's minority staff would be lost if the proposed plan were implemented.


Eleven Left


Margaret Chow, deputy administrator for the South Region, noted that Franklin High School would be left with 11 minority certified staff, Cleveland seven, Asa Mercer 11, Beacon Hill four and Kimball four.


""These include bilingual teachers who are certified,"" Chow remarked. ""The impact of the transfers will have a tremendous impact on the community.""


Meanwhile, the school district and HEW continue to negotiate over the bilingual program.


According to Tony Lee, an Asian lawyer at Legal Services who is monitoring the proposed plan, the attitude of the Seattle School Board has been ""very bad.""


""The proposed bilingual plan for the Seattle schools does not meet all the requirements set forth in the regulations established by HEW to cover the Lau vs. Nichols ruling,"" Lee said. Nevertheless, he added, ""It appears that HEW will accept Seattle's bilingual plan.""


Lee said the Lau decision calls for special instruction for those who understand no English, and also those categorized as having very limited fluency with English. The bilingual plan, he said, does not provide for the latter.


The Seattle Public Schools lost all its federal money for bilingual education programs last year. Nancy Chin, bilingual program director for Seattle Public Schools, said HEW felt the plan submitted by the school district last year did not establish sufficient ""relative need"" for such a program.

SAN FRANCISCO -- (Sept. 29) -- ""We won't move,"" say the elderly residents of the International Hotel. The tenants of the hotel, located in the last block of what used to be a 10-block Manilatown, face eviction in less than 60 days.


When the sheriff comes to the hotel, the tenants plan to barricade themselves in their rooms. Supporters will form a human barricade around the building.


One volunteer working for the International Hotel Tenants Association (IHTA) said, ""Over a hundred organizations have committed themselves to a phone tree and will come down to the hotel within an hour's notice.""


The hotel is near the expanding financial district in downtown San Francisco, and the land on which the hotel stands has been appraised at one and a quarter million dollars. The hotel owners feel the value of the land is worth more than the 90 elderly, poor Filipino and Chinese males, without families, living in the hotel.


If the hotel goes, the remaining landmark of Manilatown and the home of these elderly Asians will vanish.


Early last month, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of the IHTA. IHTA was asking for reversal of a Superior Court decision that the hotel owners had the right to evict the hotel tenants.


Joe Diones, hotel manager since 1968, said, ""The sheriff has a 60 day option under law to serve the court order of eviction. On the 55th day, five-day notices of eviction will be posted. On the sixth day (after) five-day notices have been posted, the sheriff can legally come in and evict the tenants.""


The International Hotel Tenants Association has proposed that the city buy the building from the present owners and sell it back to the tenants. The tenants, under cooperative ownership, would then renovate the hotel.


Diones said, ""Housing people and lawyers are working on three proposals to be presented to Mayor (George) Moscone and the Board of Supervisors as to how the International Hotel Tenants Association will pay back the city if they decide to buy the building.""


The IHTA has already recieved $100,000 from the Campaign for Human Development, a Catholic funding agency. The IHTA plans to use this money as down payment for purchase of the hotel. The Campaign for Human Development has assured IHTA another $100,000 as soon as a proposal has been submitted. The Housing Authority has just received appraisals on the building and the Mayor's office will soon announce whether it will be able to implement the IHTA proposal.


The situation for the International Hotel is the same now as it was five years ago when its fate became a city-wide issue. A Campaign for Human Development proposal states: ""Ninety residents, poor and elderly, with language problems, some ill or disabled with the need for a supportive community to survive. No place has been found to re-establish this community.""

A comprehensive history of Filipinos in Washington State is being compiled by the Department of General Administration's Division of Archives. The project is part of the Washington State Oral/Aural History Program.


Through tape recorded interviews with numerous Filipinos, the history of Filipinos has been traced from the early 1900's to the mid 1950's. Emphasis has been centered on the Seattle-King County area, where 80 per cent of the state's Filipino American population resides.


The documentaton will eventually result in the writing and publication of a book and a possible supplemental periodical about the history of the Filipino American.


Among those participating in the project are: Timothy Frederick, program coordinator; Dorothy Laigo Cordova, community advisor; Nancy Ordona Koslosky, interviewer; Carolina Apostol, transcriber; Teresa Croin, Cynthia Mejia, Nancy Laigo jr. Cordova, and Bob Flor.


The history of the Philippines and the United States is closely intertwined Filipinos revolted for independence from Spain in 1896. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Filipinos and Americans were fighting a common enemy. The Treaty of Paris gave the United States control of the Philippines and the promise of independence was broken. The United States took over and occupied the Philippines.


President William McKinley, in a message to Congress in 1899, stated, ""The Philippines are ours, not to exploit, but to develop, to civilize, to educate, to train in the science of self-government.""


American Occupation


During American occupation in the early 1900's, the foundations of the American democratic government and educational system were laid in that country. The young Filipino learned to read white American books and periodicals, patronize white American movies and amusements, dress and act as white middle-stream Americans.


The majority of the Filipino pioneers to this country were male, young, single, primarily Hocanos, from the North on the Island of Luzon. Many were from large families with limited economic opportunities.


The American Dream and the spirit of adventure lured many to America. ""The reason why we migrate,"" said Fabian Bergano, ""is to make a challenge for a better way of living and also pursue, with the thought on mind, for the goal of educational success...and to see the world.""


Trinidad Rojo said the opportunities for a ""self-supporting student"" were better in the United States. ""The assistance was better than in the Philippines,"" he remarked.


Mariano Angeles pointed out that it had always been his ambition to go abroad. ""Missionaries were boarding in our home,"" he said, ""and they told me about America, what kind of people they have and what kind of government they have.""


Salvador Del Fierro says he befriended some Americans and ""they told me about the wonder of America.""


Easy Immigration


Before 1953, travel from the Philippines to the United States was unrestricted, so immigration was easy.


For the price of a boat ticket, $150, the American Dream was yours Some came first-class, some second-class and countless came by steerage.


Young, eager, alone, with family and friends, all dreaming a dream, expecting so much.


""I was so excited I even lose my tie when I went to America,"" said Felipe Dumlao, laughing. ""I went to the plank...when you get on the boat, big boat. I don't know what happen to me. I was so anxious. My father said 'bye-bye' and I don't even look at them. I just ran inside. Just me alone, but I find a lot of friends on the boat.""


Mrs. Bibiana Castillano recalls that her boat ride to America was not a very pleasant experience. She says she was seasick.


""I was in the hospital on the boat until I landed in Seattle,"" she said.


The trip to America took approximately 30 days, with stops in Korea, Japan and Hong Kong. Life on the boat wasn't easy. Passengers lived in very cramped quarters and had a limited diet. Many got seasick, some were confined to sick bay, some died from disease and many were quarantined upon arrival.


Dumlao said there was a lot of disease, primarily meningitis, among those on his boat. There was, he said, poor ventilation. ""When the people get sick,"" he commented, ""they just throw-up there.""


Dumlao mentioned that four men on his boat passed away. ""I am anxious to see how they bury the people on the boat,"" he recounted. ""They just dump it in the water.""


By Steerage


Sam Figueras came to America by steerage. He recalls that most of those in steerage were Filipinos. ""The living condition in the ship is almost unbearable,"" he said, ""and I didn't mind very much because I know I'm not going to live in that condition all my life but just on the ship over here.""


Those quarantined for any length of time learned new methods of survival.


Zacarias M. Managan was quarantined in William Head, British Columbia. ""The company left us,"" he said. ""The ship left us. They only provided us certain amount of food that we have to ration.


""I learn a lot during that time because the people who came from the North, the Nortenians, Bauanganians, lived close to the sea back home. They know how to find food from the sea. They used to go down there and get some mussles and the octopus and, that's the first time I tasted octopus.""


Mrs. Maria Beltran, a nurse, was quarantined with 300 other Filipinos and sent to Firlands. When the head nurse at Firlands discovered she was a nurse, the nurse told her of special work for public health nurses.


""That's the only school in the whole world that was giving that and I want to do it,"" she said. ""I played safe so I went to apply after I was released.""


Mixed Feeling


Those who were healthy arrived in Seattle with mixed feelings.


""I don't like it,"" Eddie Acena said. ""It was cold. It was winter and it is snowing.""


Bibiana Castillano went to a Chinese hotel. ""Boy did I have such an unhappy time at the place,"" she said. ""It was a very poor kind, and even though I just came from the Philippines, I never lived like that.""


Those met by family and friends were brought to Filipino-run clubhouses in the University District and on the fringes of the Central Area. There, room and board and job referrals were available.


""We have boys from our town who preceeded us,"" Trinidad Rojo recalled. ""Fortunately for us they were living in the Filipino Club House at the University District. We were introduced right away to the University community.""


Pete Filaraca said, ""There was a Filipino Catholic Club there and it was run by one of our townmates. That's where we stayed and they were the ones that found us jobs.""


Ponce Torres arrived in Seattle with six others from his home town. ""We ask the taxi driver to bring us to the YMCA in Seattle,"" Torres said.


""It was a funny experience for us. We were using our short pants just like in the Philippines, and the people gave us insulting looks. They were amazed by the way we dressed, but we did not realize then...""

Court testimony in the class action discrimination suit brought against the largest cannery company in North America ended November 10, but Federal District Judge Gus Solomon is not expected to rule on the case until sometime in January.


The Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA), a Seattle-based organization fighting employment discrimination in Alaska's canneries, brought the suit against the New England Fish Co (NEFCO) in 1973, charging that Alaskan Native and Asian American workers were relegated to the lowest-paying, menial cannery jobs, dined in segregated mess halls and slept in segregated bunkhouses.


Suit on behalf of labor


ACWA's suit is the first class action case ever brought on behalf of a seasonal, migratory labor force. It is also the largest case ever brought on behalf of Alaskan native and Asian American workers, potentially affecting 1,000 cannery workers.


The suit went to trial November 8, after negotiations between ACWA and NEFCO attorneys fell through. The negotiations failed when agreement could not be reached on an affirmative action requirement for skilled positions in the canneries.


Approximagely 50 per cent of the company's employees are non-white but the vast majority of those working in the lowest cannery position are non-white. There are no non-whites in the top administrative category, and few in other skilled positions.


Nemesio Domingo, ACWA representative told the Examiner after the surprisingly short three-day trial, ""At the heart of anything we want is a 50 per cent affirmative action requirement for the skilled positions. That is the cornerstone of any kind of settlement we would accept.""


During the trial, NEFCO attorneys argued that the percentage of minorities applying for skilled positions was less than six or seven per cent.


Michael Dundy, NEFCO attorney, told Judge Solomon during the opening arguments November 8 that the company has no legal obligation to train and promote employees.


""The people must be able to perform when they arrive,"" Dundy said. ""There's no promotion. If someone's got the skills and we know they got the skills, we give them the job.""


Nepotistic hiring


Michael Fox, ACWA attorney, said the company engaged in nepotistic hiring practices and that there were separate hiring channels for whites and non-whites.


The absence of written job qualifications can lead to the imposition of illegal and racially discriminatory practices, Fox told the judge.


""We contend,"" Fox continued, ""that some of the opinions offered by some of their (the company's) witnesses are ideal job qualifications rather than actual job qualifications applied on those in the industry.""


Fox said that before ACWA filed suit in 1973, as many as 16 non-white cannery workers were housed in one room. Fox called attention to the deposition of one worker who said his bunkhouse floor was so warped he could roll a stone down it. Even today. Fox said, non-whites continue to receive inferior housing.


Dundy retorted, ""Most of the housing is not good for anyone."" The NEFCO attorneys added that, recently, the company has upgraded the housing.


One witness, a white woman, testified that the mess hall at Chatum was partitioned into two areas, one for whites and one for non-whites. The non-whites, the woman testified, received no bread, butter, coffee or potatoes.


No bread?


Judge Solomon asked, ""If it wasn't on the table, were you able to get it elsewhere in the dining room?""


The woman replied no.


NEFCO had witnesses prepared to testify that non-whites and whites received comparable food, but Solomon said their testimony wasn't necessary.


""I want to tell you now that I believe they served bread and butter,"" the judge said shortly before court testimony ended.


""I would agree on the bread and butter, but don't press it too far,"" the judge cautioned Dundy.


Ivan Fox, superintendent at Uganik Bay since 1963, testified that hiring was done strictly according to ability. People have to have the ""desire"" to become a machinist, Fox said.


Is the desire, asked the judge, stronger among whites than it is among non-whites?


Fox said no.


Solomon, who began questioning Fox, then asked about the different food served non-whites. Do Filipinos want to be served ""ethnic food?"" asked Solomon.


""Yes,"" the superintendent replied ""Rice and pork and ginger beef and that kind of thing."" He added, however, that whites and non-whites ate at both mess halls. And he said the food at both halls was comparable.


Solomon brought up the testimony of plaintiffs Nemesio and Silme Domingo who said the food they received was of poorer quality.


Too late to change


""Didn't you tell him (Nemesio Domingo) it was too late in the year to change the food?"" asked Solomon.


Fox said he could only ""slightly recall"" the incident.


""He was a troublemaker,"" the judge said. ""He asked for better food, didn't he?""


Fox denied that was the reason Domingo was fired. He said Domingo was fired for other reasons.


Solomon asked Fox to comment on the contention many, many people were housed in one room.


""We had dormitory-style rooms,"" Fox replied.


Solomon asked about the statement of the plaintiffs that, out of four toilets in the bunkhouse, two or three were never working.


""I have read their statement,"" Fox said, ""and I don't agree with it.""


Asked if there were fewer dressers and chairs in the Filipino bunkhouse, Fox replied, ""They (the workers) move them around, so it's pretty difficult to say where they're going to be.""


The judge noted testimony that there are very few minorities requesting work on tenders, the boats carrying the fish back to the canneries.


Fox said there were probably six or eight Alaskan natives on the 17 tenders. There were no Filipinos, Fox added.


""Compatibility"" is a quite important qualification of those who work on tenders, Fox said.


Badge of discrimination


The judge told Fox the U.S. Navy once used the test of compatibility as a qualification, but the Supreme Court struck it down, ruling it was ""a badge of discrimination"" used to keep ""Negroes"" out of the navy.


Michael Fox argued that minorities have been kept out of entry level jobs and that the company should be required to reserve a certain number of those jobs to minorities in the future. Had there not been discrimination in certain classifications. Fox argued, there would be significant numbers of minorities in those positions today.


One of the NEFCO attorneys said, however, ""What the plaintiffs are asking for can be described in two words, quota system."" What is fair, the attorney said, is to hire based on qualifications and skill which, he said, NEFCO has always done.


Judge Solomon, at one point, said, ""I believe that the New England Fish Co is not required to hire any non-white because he is non-white. They should hire on qualifications, Solomon said.


However, the judge added, looking at the statistical absence of non-whites in the skilled, higher paying jobs, the burden can be placed on the defendents to show non-discrimination.


Hesitancy about ruling


Solomon cautioned that ""court decree"" will not solve the problems of the case. He expressed hesitancy about ruling that there have to be written job qualifications. If he did so, to what extent he should spell them out. Solomon asked.


During the next two months, attorneys for both sides will submit briefs and rebuttals to Judge Solomon. Sometime during the 15 days following the two month period, Solomon will come out with his decision.


ACWA representatives feel that if they win this case, they will be in a much better position to negotiate favorable settlements with the several other cannery companies against which they have also filed suit.

The employment committee of the Seattle Women's Commission will investigate the garment industry following a letter to the Commission from a Chinese woman denied the opportunity to translate for Chinese workers at an April union meeting, the Examiner has learned.


A complaint filed last month with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by the woman, Betty Tsang, has been withdrawn and the Board will not go forward with its investigation.


Sources say, however, that the complaint will be refiled with the NLRB within the six month statute of limitations unless the union, the United Garment Workers Union, Local 17, allows the Chinese Media Committee to translate at future union meetings. Tsang withdrew her complaint before she left for Hong Kong in the middle of June. There was insufficient time to line up witnesses for the investigation, sources said, and therefore Tsang may refile the complaint when she returns to Seattle next fall.


The United Garment Workers Union represents approximately 800 Seattle workers. Tsang estimates 25 to 30 per cent of the union membership is Chinese, most of whom do not understand English and do not attend union meetings.


The union membership, at an April 5 meeting, voted down a motion to have Tsang translate for the Chinese workers. However, during the latest union meeting June 15, when the membership approved a new three-year contract, a Chinese interpreter was allowed to translate for the Chinese in the meeting hall.


Margaret Rogers, president of the union, said that prior to the June 15 meeting the union received a call from the National Labor Relations Board and was told that there was going to be a Chinese translator at the meeting and ""we had better use her.""


Asked if the union will continue allowing a translator to interpret future meetings, Rogers replied, ""I don't know. Most of our Chinese members don't come to the meetings. They have families. They want to go home and fix dinner for their husbands and their children.""


Felton Miles, NLRB investigator, said he called the union and told them of Tsang's complaint and that there was a good chance the Board would find a violation of the National Labor Relations Act in the union's refusal to allow a translator for Chinese members ""less than truly literate"" in English.


The case is now closed, Miles said, because the complaint was withdrawn. ""We've had some discussion since,"" he said. ""Some say it was a definite violation (of the Labor Relations Act). Some say there was definitely not a violation.""


One source told the Examiner last month of a case in which several Chinese women working at Seattle Quilt Manufacturing Co., whose employees are represented by the Upholsters' International Union, Local 6, were laid off last year despite their many years seniority.


The Examiner has obtained copies of letters the three women wrote the Upholsters International Union in September. In the letters, originally written in Chinese, the women asked the union to challenge the company on their behalf.


One woman wrote that she had been employed by Seattle Quilt for eight years and ""during that period I have never committed any wrongdoing.


""I was fired from work in July for absenteeism,"" her letter stated. ""However, I was absent from work only because of the illness and death of my husband and I did inform the supervisor-assistant...when I could not come to work.""


The woman demanded back pay and reinstatement.


Another woman wrote that she was dismissed ""on a pretext of slow and inefficient work."" She wrote that she felt she had been treated unfairly.


""I hope that some grievance proceedings would be taken by the union to look into this matter, her letter stated.


Al Gord, business representative and international representative for the union, which represents about 500 Seattle workers, said the women did not go directly to the union with a complaint following their dismissal, but instead went to ""outsiders.""


The women, Gord said, should have exhausted their means through the union before going to ""outside sources."" The letters of complaint were registered with the union, Gord said, only after there had been a heated verbal confrontation between the women and management representatives.


The police were called in at one point, but there were no arrests, Gord said. ""They (the management) just wanted them out of the shop,"" he said.


Asked if the women had job security because of their long tenure with Seattle Quilt, Gord replied, ""Nobody has security if they violate the (grievance) procedures.""


""The case is completed and out as far as we're concerned,"" Gord declared.


Sources at the meeting between management and the three women said the woman who was charged she was fired for absenteeism told the management representatives her husband was constantly ill and that she had to take him to the doctor all the time. She explained that as a result she was late to work, sources said.


The woman's supervisor charged, sources said, that the woman did not come to work for a period of time and did not give an indication when she would return.


The woman responded that she was absent because of the death of her husband and that there was no way she could determine when she could return, sources said.


Gord said the Upholsters' International Union has found jobs for two of the women, but that the third Chinese woman never came in to see union representatives.


He termed the relationship between union officials and Chinese members ""fairly good."" He said the union does not receive many complaints from Chinese workers. Approximately 80 to 100 of the union's members are Chinese, he said. During union meetings, which are called when members petition for them, some of the sons of the Chinese women help translate, Gord said.


One source, whose mother was laid off by Seattle Quilt recently, told the Examiner 80 to 90 percent of the employees at that factory are Chinese women. The pay is ""a little bit higher"" there, the source said.


The source said one young man went to speak with the union about unfair treatment his mother was receiving. The mother has an allergy, but was given work involving jackets with fur linings. She had an explanation from a doctor. ""The union does nothing,"" the source said angrily. The mother had been working at Seattle Quilt for seven years.


The mother was told by Seattle Quilt that it did not have enough work for her to do, the source said, and she was laid off. The mother was told that she would receive a phone call when the company had more work, the source said.


""I don't want my mom to go back because she suffer so many problems there,"" the source said. ""I told her a lot of times, 'Get out of that damn factory.' Sometimes she is scolded. Sometimes when my mom is coming home, she is crying and I ask her, 'How come?' And she said her boss scold her all the time.


""When things happen in the factory, she would like to hide it because she thinks we will get angry.


""I still think the Chinese don't get equal rights like the other people. When they complain, the management fight it. They think the Chinese are a weak minority. The Chinese want to speak up, but they cannot speak the language.""


Gord said complaints from Chinese workers are usually the complaints of ""Chinese against Chinese."" He said he did not want to discuss personal squabbles.


The Seattle Women's Commission, at a June 21 meeting, voted unanimously to have its employment committee look into whether the United Garment Workers Union, Local 17 is disregarding the right of the Chinese workers to know what is going on during union meetings.


Employment committee sources said the matter is still at the ""talking"" stage and that the investigation has not yet begun. One source said the investigation would start initially with the problem of the Chinese translator, but that it could lead into other problems involving Asian garment workers.


The employment committee, after its investigation, will make a recommendation to the full Commission and the Commission would then decide on a course of action.


""It could be writing a letter, asking representatives to come in and discuss the problem or it could be asking an agency or organization to take action,"" Employment Committee Member, Delores Sibonga told the Examiner.


The investigation has not been targeted for completion by any particular date.

Looking back over accomplishments in our District in 1975, one could get the distinct feeling that things are moving right along. However, under the surface, those who are active in the District have serious differences in perspective.


A primary problem is that people active in District improvement are largely looking at the situation from one viewpoint -- their own. That perspective could be commercial, social service, urban planning, or one of narrow nationalism.


The Examiner thinks all these viewpoints are important because there are many components to our community. It is difficult to say that one project should have priority over all others. After all, we need people with all kinds of skills and ideas to make the whole place come alive. Housing, for example, is a foremost problem. But only recently, after a year or more of housing demands, did a few business people state their support for low income housing in the District, probably because they previously saw low income housing as detrimental to their interests. Likewise, some activists don't understand why we should be concerned with increased commercial activity.


Chicken or Egg


Whether commercial shops can attract housing developers or whether residential units are needed first for small business activity to flourish is a chicken and egg argument.


People involved in one or another District improvement need to support each other. Some are now realizing that behind-the-back name-calling about ""District capitalists"" or ""radical kids"" is unconstructive and a barrier to progress.


Those with business interests and those who are concerned with social welfare demands now see that they need each other. Examples of efforts being made to span the gap are numerous: The Corrective Action Program Committee (CAP) making personal contact with businesspeople about the social action plan proposed last fall, and CAP's support for Ray Chin and Jimmy Woo who applied to HUD for Section Eight funds. IDEA's effort to provide a few complimentary tickets to community organizations for their development conference a few months ago is another concrete example of willingness to communicate with the other side.


Sadly, though, there exists another hinderance to District cooperation. This is the division between those who feel the area is an ""international"" district and those such as Chong Wah who see the area as ""Chinatown.""


Hassles Everywhere


Perhaps most visible during the long process of forming the public corporation, the ID vs. Chinatown hassle has been surfacing everywhere. During the early public corporation talks, the strong Chinese faction was represented and essentially wanted control of the entire process. Later Chong Wah pulled out of the largely Interim-sponsored effort and announced it would create a separate public corporation. The Chong Wah corporation charter turned out to be the same as Interim's, except for the substitution of the term Chinatown for International District.


Let's look into the reasons for this difference of approach. Chong Wah has been the most influential organization in the Chinatown area since the turn of the century. The Japanese lost a great deal of business and property in the area during the Second World War. Filipinos have essentially used the District as a stopping-off point between fishing and agricultural labor contracts. The Chinese have come to see the ID core area as owned and populated by Chinese, an argument which is statistically unsound. They recognize that other ethnic groups also live and work in the area, but prefer to consider the area ""Chinese"" thus falling under the jurisdiction of Chong Wah, the Chinese Benevolent Society.


Mayor Office Takes Task


The Mayor's office was charged with mediating the dispute. Compromises were made including corporation name changes and allowing equal representation from both groups on the list of charter members.


The result was a compromise slate which is the same thing that could have been achieved if the groups had worked together to start with, instead of having the Mayor ""mediate"" between the two groups. The only and most important difference was that since the compromise process was under the Mayor's control, he could consult the side he favored, Chong Wah, on the choice of the charter member list. Unfortunately, that Chinese group does not speak for the International District.


Again, we see the ""For Chinese Only"" label placed on the kiosk for Hing Hay Park. The IDEA/Interim Kiosk raffle netted a couple thousand dollars and the design process of a kiosk for the park began. The Chinatown Chamber of Commerce heard about the project, didn't think the design was Chinese enough, and promptly submitted their own design and funds to the Park Department. The Chamber's claim was that the park is Chinese, and the pagoda is Chinese, therefore the kiosk must also be Chinese.


Looking at Problem


What we're getting at is the problem of people looking at a situation in different ways...and how the problem is made worse by hassling over what viewpoint will predominate. We all need to run the show, not the Mayor's office, or HUD officials who keep forgetting that they have made a verbal commitment to the ID. Every time these petty, personalized hassles appear, someone loses and its always the District as a whole and especially its residents.


Of course, it's unrealistic to think that everyone will start liking one another in the upcoming year. But at least people should recognize that every project will be delayed if we don't develop common goals and work together. We don't have to love each other, but we do have to quit working against each other.

Filipino Youth Activities of Seattle issued the following statement recently regarding their decision to participate in the opening day ceremonies at the King County Stadium. The Examiner feels this is a responsible action on the part of an Asian community organization in regards to the welfare of the International District.


The Filipino Youth Activities Khordobah will not participate in the King County Domed Stadium dedication program Saturday, March 27 because of its deep commitment to concerns affecting Filipino Americans especially in the City of Seattle.


We appreciate the invitation issued not once, but twice by those preparing the gala dedication. We also appreciate the considerations, extended the FYA by County Councilwoman Ruby Chow and Prof. Val Laigo of the Seattle King County Arts Commission, both urging dedication officials to include the FYA in their plans.


The Princesa Drill Team, Cumbanchero Percussioneers and Mandayan Marchers will not be counted among the many participating groups to recognize and emphasize the benigned neglect of Filipino Americans in Chinatown. For almost 5 years the concerns of Pinoy elderly and other Asian Americans, disenfranchised and disadvantaged residents have not been totally met by governmental agencies. This district which is the cradle of our beginnings in the Pacific Northwest, continues to serve the various needs of Filipino Americans. The impact of the Domed County Stadium called to the attention of the powers-to-be years back by Filipino American young people and other Asian American activists has not been resolved. It is only now that minimal health care is being provided to Chinatown residents. There is no assurance of its permanence not or any other necessary social services.


The FYA's token appearance in the dedication program would have been a signal to the Anglo Community and an unqualified endorsement to the power groups that all is well with our Pinoy residents in Chinatown.


In respect to our Pinoy, Asian American and other minority brothers and sisters, the FYA Khordobah will seek other avenues of assistance to them in concert with those responsible community organizations working on behalf of Chinatown residents.

The regional office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced June 11 the approval of Security Pacific Incorporated's application to build 99 units of low income housing the International District.


The 99 units represent the total amount of subsidized low income housing units allocated for the District under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the fiscal year. The program is designed to provide low income housing for urban areas.


In the first round of allocations last November, 24 units were allocated to the District, but were not used because the hotel owner, Ray Chin, could not find a profitable formula for the investment Over 600 low income units were approved city wide for last year's program.


Security Pacific's proposal calls for an 11-story structure, covering one fourth of the block on the southeast corner of Weller St. and Maynard Ave. It was chosen over four other applications to build in the District, all of the proposals for sites north of Jackson Street.


Actual construction of the building may, however, be delayed since the plan for the structure does not meet zoning regulations of the particular block. As planned, the structure rises higher than the 65-foot height restriction and also does not have any retail-commercial functions planned for the street level which are required by the zoning laws.


Selection of Security Pacific's site was greeted with mixed reactions.


""In approving this plan, we feel that HUD has finally acted on a project that serves the best interest of the residents in this neighborhood,"" remarked Bob Santos, director of Inter*im and member of the Housing Alliance.


The Alliance, along with other community organizations, including Inter*im, Chinese Information Center, the International District Youth Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action, supported the Security Pacific proposal on the grounds that housing sites north of Jackson caused undue physical strain for older residents because of the steep incline of the hill and because the Weller-Maynard site ""offered greater amenities to the residents.""


The Alliance also said it supported Security Pacific's proposal because it was consistent with their desire to maintain the ""residential core"" of the District. Security Pacific has assured the Housing Alliance it would provide the residents of the District first priority for occupancy and that the structure will remain a resident for low-income tenants even after five years when, according to Section 8 regulations, they have the option of increasing rents.


Concern over the choice of Security Pacific proposal came from the city's Department of Community Development, the International Special Review District Board and portions of the business sector who suggested that Security Pacific failed to meet the zoning regulation and also Special Review Board guidelines.


Further, approval of the site has raised some suspicion as to HUD's intent. ""In choosing the housing which has the most problems in zoning,"" said James Mason, District manager, ""one would wonder if HUD is serious about low-income housing in the District.""


Security Pacific Incorporated is a subsidiary of Leach and McDounough Development Company, which has been involved in the development of other low-income housing projects.

The district will have a community center as early as February, 1977, constituents of the Chinatown/International District public corporation were told, if everything goes according to the plans of the body's council. That is when the corporation is scheduled to occupy the Bush Hotel, said Ben Woo, council chairperson, at the October 20 constituency meeting.


Actual renovation is planned to begin in July of next year. Woo said. Before then, the council hopes to retain an architect to develop a design to renovate a portion of the hotel into a community center and to select a building contractor.


In addition to the commercial-retail space already planned on the ground floor facing the streets, the council plans to build a tunnel arcade through the present hotel lobby with access to Hing Hay Park. The hotel lobby would be moved upstairs to the second floor.


The council also announced that the final recommendations of the consultant team headed by Paul Mar and Ed Burke for the community center will be presented on Wednesday, Nov. 17.


In a related discussion, the council considered plans to revert $500,000 from the third-year Community Block Grant money allocated for the district's street-scaping project for the public corporation project. The City, through District Manager James Mason's office, has submitted a $800,000 grant proposal to the Federal Economic Development Association for the district which could replace the $500,000, and is optimistic of its approval.


If the money is reverted, part of it would be used by the council to place a larger down payment than what they now have for the acquisition of the Bush Hotel.


In another matter, Woo informed the constituents that the council has asked the mayor to fill the council seat vacated by Chong Wa member Ling Mar by the end of the year.


Subsequent to the meeting, the mayor named Bruce Mar, another member of Chong Wa, to the council. Many District groups had support the nomination of Mayumi Tsutakawa, community activist and Examiner editor, to the council.

On the day the Dome opened, about 150 residents and activists reaffirmed their intention of preserving and improving the conditions in the International District. A rally was held in the afternoon of March 27 at the Praying Mantis gung-fu academy, and later the group moved to the site of the stadium to leaflet the curious first day Dome visitors.


Representatives of elderly, youth, and social service groups dominated the afternoon rally. Al Masigat of the Filipino Senior Citizen's Club described his life in the District. ""There are all types of people here,"" he said, ""and there is no trouble in here. As for the statistics of crime, there is less crime committed in this area.""


A few years ago, Masigat was offered a place to live downtown but he refused it saying, ""I like living in a place where I can get my happiness, living with my own people.""


Ted Ranjo, representing the International Drop-In Center, (the ""old fogies,"" as he put it), commended the youth for their service to the community and stated that the elderly are demanding, not requesting, their just share from the city, county and federal government.


A resident of the Milwaukee Hotel, Mrs. Louie, explained through a translator the living situation in her hotel. There is no heat and residents must supply their own gas burners for heat. Worst of all, though, is that there are no locks on the front door and she and many of the other elderly Chinese women living in the building are afraid that after the stadium opens there may be a greater chance of being robbed. She expressed her appreciation to the youth and all those trying to help her.


A high school student and member of the International District Youth Council, Claude Blumenzweig asserted that to combat the problems of no heat, no water, poor lighting, traffic and pollution, ""we must organize against big business.""


Mitsue Doniego spoke of the future direction of the International District Housing Alliance. ""The struggle today is qualitatively different than that in 1972,"" she said. ""Today, we have some results such as the ID Clinic to be proud of, and if we work together, step by step, surely we will be victorious in making gains for the residents and small businesspeople of the District.""


The group then walked down to the stadium were 50,000 excited and confused stadium-goers pushed their way through ticket lines. About 5,000 leaflets describing conditions in the ID were distributed. The reception to the leaflets was fairly positive, according to one leafletter. Most people took them and read them. The Alliance has received some monetary donations as a result of the leafletting.

""Why should we give way graciously to the County's misallocation of public funds to build a sports stadium?"" perhaps summarizes the three years Diana Bower spent on the Stadium Impact Project which recently lost its funding.


Bower, a long-time International District supporter, was contracted by the City and County to implement the 21 Stadium Impact Resolutions passed by the City to mitigate the adverse impact of the Domed Stadium on the surrounding Pioneer Square, Skid Road and International District areas.


Although the job is far from completed, funding for the Project ran out. Bower served as liaison between the City and County governments and planned social services concentrating mainly on the International District. The Pioneer Square and Skid Road areas had agencies to deal with such matters at that time, Bower said.


Looking back now, Bower sensed that, ironically, the reason for her contract was to try to mitigate the effects of what she calls the misallocation of public funds for the Stadium. She says misallocation because the basic needs of the poor and elderly in the surrounding areas remain unmet.


Bower, a native of New York with a New England arts education, traveled in Europe and Asia studying art, architecture and graphics, she studied urban planning after she moved to the West Coast with her husband, Ted, an architect. Before the stadium project, she worked on Model Cities parks, Central Area housing programs and city transportation planning.


Early in 1973, the Citizen's Action Force, a citizen's group formed to discuss how the Stadium might affect people in the area, persuaded the County to hire someone to implement the 21 Impact Resolutions passed by the City Council during Fall, 1972. The resolutions dealt with various social services and physical improvements in the I.D. and Pioneer Square.


The project was contracted to Ted and Diana Bower, Architects and Planners, and Diana served as principle consultant on a half-time basis for three years. The salary was paid by the County and the work space and secretarial staff provided by the City.


""The funny thing is,"" Bower said, ""that that County was, in essence, paying for someone to oppose it, since the Stadium was built by the county and the person was to deal with the problems caused by the Stadium.""


Bower had been involved with the International District earlier, notably in conjunction with the Model Cities program as member of a citizen's task force and also as a staff member of Model Cities.


She traces her interest in Asian people and culture to the year she lived in India, Southeast Asia and Japan.


""Any artist on the West Coast, especially one who has travelled in Asia, can't help but have an interest and relationship to Asian art, thought, and design -- the influence of Asian art and people on the West Coast is very important,"" she maintained.


Looking back over three years, Bower sees a few major successes in the District, notably in social service: the health clinic, the community center plan which became the impetus for formation of the public corporation, street trees and the children's small park. She points to those with whom she worked to make these projects come about -- Bob Santos, Tomio Moriguchi, Susie Chin, Maxine Chan, Doug Chin, Frankie Irigon, Angel Doniego, Donnie Chin, Glenn Chinn, and many others.


""The Inter*im Social Welfare Task Force, chaired by Doug Chin, got things started,"" said Bower, ""and we made plans for comprehensive social services needs in the District, wrote proposals and looked for funding. The community center proposal is a good example of our efforts.""


Bower sees negative aspects to the stadium project. ""This big mistake is the cause of a lot of problems, a lot of bad things flowed from that,"" she said. ""District people have been forced into a situation for which there is no fair or equitable solution.


People have been pushed into a situation opposing each other or trying to decide who is expendable -- the residents, the businesses, and so on. The parking problem is a good example of this. We are trying to decide whether Kokusai theatre-goers or residents who own cars are more important, and the answer is that everyone is important.""


She continued that because of the stadium, some District people have gotten into the mind-set of accepting the burden the County has placed on them, even though the quality of life in the district is threatened.


Bower feels the Stadium impact will continue, despite the end of the Stadium Impact Project However, the Special Review Board and the Public Corporation have been formed to deal with various development and planning aspects. ""No single half-time person could deal with all of it,"" she said.


Housing is an unsolved dilemma, says Bower. Housing, basic to survival is not adequately provided for all people.


""Perhaps this is a reflection of the state of American society,"" she said.


The best solutions for the District Bower said, are those which involve the cooperation of all people -- businesspeople, residents, and others.


""Economic growth should not be the only goal in life, even though I know some businesspeople and people who build stadiums think this way,"" Bower said. She also thinks District people would start relying more on themselves, not federal funding. She likes the idea of workers owning their own means of production. The Cicada Arts and Crafts Cooperative, which she helped initiate, is one example.


""Housing, garment factories and lots of projects could be run as consortiums or cooperatives with people putting in money and running the project cooperatively,"" she said. Commenting on the women working in garment factories under poor working conditions, Bower asked, ""Why can't we have our own factory, maybe on a small scale, and arrange it so the people doing the sewing own the factory?


""I have an educated mistrust of federal funds as a source for District projects,"" Bower remarked. ""Just look at the failure of Ray Chin's low income housing project utilizing (Department of Housing and Urban Development) Section 8 funds. These HUD programs do not work out partly because of the tons of federal regulations put on people who accept the funding. In addition, the reporting and monitoring procedures are terrible unless you have a big corporation to deal with it.""


The secret, Bower says, is to think small. She offered this quote from E.F. Schumacher: ""I would suggest that the possibilities for any real change, can only come from small groups of people...the dinosaurs will collapse under their own weight...If any of us still expects any real help from big, powerful organizations. I suggest they are wasting their time.""


""Small people, even poor people, can create an economic base,"" Bower said. She pointed to China as a good example of small units of individuals working together and joining to make a large movement.


""We have a tremendous asset in the smallness of the I.D."" she said, ""If we want to, we can communicate with each other three times a day, in person.""

For Japanese immigrants and their children, sports, such as baseball served as both recreational and social institutions. Over the years, thousands of young Nisei men and women played baseball, basketball and football in teams and leagues organized in the Japanese community throughout the state.


This month marks the fiftieth year celebration of the Taiyo Athletic Club. For some old timers in their 60's and 70's, this will be the occasion to see old friends who now live in other places such as Japan, California and Chicago.


Shig Osawa, one of the oldest Nisei in Seattle, tells of sandlot baseball games at 5th and Main . . . the turn of the century. The few Japanese and Chinese kids in the neighborhood at that time played catch all the way to South School, the old Bailey Gatzert and home. Occasionally, Osawa recalls, they challenged ""a team of white kids from up on 10th and Main.""


There was often no money even for a ball, so Osawa ""got up 5 cents and bought a rubber ball."" Then he wrapped twine around it many times, and sewed a cloth cover with a darning needle. When they couldn't find a nickel, they even tried using a rock, wrapping the twine over it.


In 1906, the first Japanese baseball team was established, the Nippon Club, composed of young Issei men who toiled in typical immigrant jobs in canneries, janitorial, and domestic service. At about the same time, the Columbia Club from Tacoma, the Hayato, a Kagoshima group and the Mikado team started up.


Trips to Japan were made during this early time and games with Japanese college teams were held. The Nippon, Mikado and Columbia clubs went to Japan in 1914.


The Japanese School, established by the Japanese Association in 1904, was a likely place for young Nisei to play ball and it was here that Osawa taught Tura Nakamura, whom he later played ball with, to pitch and catch.


Perhaps the first Nisei team to organize was the Cherries, started by Mr. Doi in 1911. Doi got Osawa to play. The next year some Mikado people left that team and joined some Cherry team members to form the Asahi Club including Nakamura, Fukuda and Hide Kobayashi.


The new Asahi team played in the Star League B Class sponsored by the Spalding Sports Equipment company.


Other Issei teams flourished at this time, the Niko Niko, Great Union and Hayato.


The Asahis became the strongest team and rivalry with the Mikados was intense. According to Osawa, legitimate businesses favored the Asahis, but the Shitamachi (underworld) represented by the Toyo gambling club, favored the Mikado. Heavy game betting led to controversy over an umpire's decision at a championship game. A right ensued and a gun was pulled, said. Kenji Kawaguchi, former sports player. Osawa said the betting involved high stakes such as automobiles.


By 1919, the Asahi and Mikados each had three teams even though the Asahi were having financial trouble, due to mismanagement of the team's funds. Once $3000 or $4000 was mysteriously lost, Osawa, an Asahi member said. In 1921, a certain manager quit when the team was $3000 in debt and Tura Nakamura, George Ishihara and Osawa were left to handle the team.


They put the team into a newly-formed semi-pro league and traveled to play teams in other towns, as far away as Montana and Spokane. Through conservative management of funds, the team earned enough to travel and to make up for back debts.


In 1923, the team even went to the West Coast Japanese team championship in San Francisco. They met Fresno in over 100 degree heat. The bench of the Seattle team faced the sun. Uncomfortable in the heat, they dropped the title.


By 1924, Mr. Miyasawa was able to unite the two clubs, the Mikados and Asahis into the new Nippon Athletic Club, taking the best players form both teams. By this time, football and basketball were added to the activities.


In 1926, the Taiyo Club was started, accomodating the next best players in the community. George Ishihara was the first president and Ban Okada was responsible for organizing the group for many years. George Nishimura, prominent salmon cannery contractor, helped fund the original Taiyo Cardinals.


Kenjiro Yoshino, one of the few young Issei on the Taiyo team, said most parents favored the second generation's preoccupation with such good, clean sport as baseball. ""It kept the kids out of mischief,"" he said. Most Issei parents, though they had not played baseball in Japan, enthusiastically attended league games and championships and cheered their sons to victory.


A Junior League started in 1928 with sandlot teams such as the R.F. Giants, Indians, Asahi Cherries and Asahi Midgets. Later, the Dearborn Huskies joined as the Taiyo Cubs.


The Japanese American Courier, a Nisei newspaper published by James Sakamoto sponsored an athletic league from 1928 until the war broke out. It included baseball, basketball and football sections. It also included a girls' basketball league. The coaches volunteered their time.


Many young team players displayed excellent athletic ability and joined varsity and all-city teams. Kenji Kawaguchi made the first team in baseball when he was only a freshman at Franklin High School. Kay Takayoshi became a semi-pro umpire.


The Taiyos reached peak membership in the mid-30's with a roster of 120 members, five baseball, three football and three basketball teams. They competed in the Courier Leagues, Inter-City, Inter-District Class B, Independent City, as well as the Fourth of July and Labor Day baseball Tournaments.


The Fourth of July brought the annual Japanese state baseball championship at Columbia field, now the Rainier Playfield. An all-weekend event, it brought hundreds of Nikkei out to enjoy the vendors, booths and games. Started in the late 30's, it continued until the war broke out.


The annual highlight, though, was the championship between the Taiyos and the Nippon Athletic Club.


The teams earned money to pay for equipment by having Shibai, theatrical programs consisting of Japanese and American skits and dramatic presentations, musical talent acts, instrumental performances by young and old. The teams continued to sponsor exchange trips to Japan, including education tours for men and some for women.


Toward the end of the 30's and early 40's, sports interests were changing, and some older Nisei started taking up golf and fishing, according to some old Taiyo members. Only one Taiyo team entered league competition in 1941.


After the war, the teams were not started up again, because ""everyone was too busy,"" according to Kawaguchi. Yoshino pointed out that many community leaders who had helped out with the youth teams were now more concerned with survival matters such as gaining back property, businesses and finding homes for their families after the war.


Yoshino said the start of Little League after the war took many Japanese youngsters away from the possible start of a new team. Of course, many Sansei today are concerned more with basketball, Yoshino conceded.


Tad Kuniyuki, another former Taiyo player, feels much respect is due the Sakamotos -- James and his wife Misao for the many hours they put into their newspaper, making the Courier Leagues possible. A former sports writer for the Courier, Kuniyuki said the Sakamotos spent countless unrewarded hours for the sake of the young second generation.


The Taiyos have had several reunions since the first after the war in 1960. This, their golden jubilee should, indeed, be a very special one.

No one was injured in the August 9 arson fire in the Milwaukee Hotel, but afterwards a number of its residents were afraid for their security because of the condition of the hotel.


The fire department reported that the blaze, which began shortly before 4 p.m., started in one or two places in the stairwell of the hotel. The fire, however, was prevented from spreading because of the fire doors.


The fire caused an estimated $20-25,000 damage.


Hugh R. Macek, hotel manager, told the Examiner that three girls came down to his office and told him there was a fire in the garbage cans which he had brought downstairs earlier that morning. He tried to put the fire out himself with a fire extinguisher, Macek said, but was driven back by the smoke and flames. He said he then pulled the fire alarm.


""I couldn't say (who started the fire),"" Macek said, ""I wouldn't even know.""


Some of the hotel residents who were fleeing during the fire came out through the fire escape.


William Burkovich, who came out of the hotel coughing from the smoke, held an elderly man on crutches by the arm.


Burkovich and others who escaped the fire, which was brought under control soon after firefighters entered the scene shortly after 4 p.m., were half-dressed and coughing from the smoke. Burkovich said that after he smelled smoke he went to see if there were any other residents he could take out. ""I got a little smoke,"" he said, ""but I'm all right.""


An employee of the Silver Dragon Restaurant located on 7th Ave, and connected to the hotel, told the Examiner that when he came to work at 4 p.m. he smelled ""something funny"" in the restaurant's bar. The air conditioning system is on the other side of the restaurant, he noted.


Donnie Chin, of the International District Emergency Center, said that after the hotel fire, there was no heat, lighting, or electricity for the residents. ""We had to bring some food for them,"" he said. ""They are redoing the wiring.""


He said he has patrolled the hotel at nights and the fire doors have been left open. He criticized the hotel manager, saying it was pressure from the Emergency Center which resulted in the installation of the fire doors in the first place.

At Blaine Memorial United Methodist Church, there is a cooperative pre-school run totally by parents. The children, primarily Asian, are broken up into the toddler class, for those 18 months to three years old, and the pre-school class, for those three to four years old.


A.C. Arai, parent coordinator at the pre-school, said, ""It's not just our children learning, but parents learning as well -- learning how to raise our children and how to react to various situations.""


Seattle Central Community College provides a family life instructor for the preschool who visits once a week and attends monthly meetings with parents as a resource person. This is the third year the parent cooperative pre-school has been affiliated with the College, A.C. points out.


The tuition is about $15 a quarter. The pre-school meets three to four times a week and the children go on excursions, ferry boat rides, fire department tours and picnics.


Sharon Lorentz Smith, a Head Start instructor for two years, is the teacher She speaks fluent Japanese, Spanish, Swedish and French. She has a state teaching certificate for public schools.


Although the preschool meets three or four times a week, A.C. would like to see an all-day pre-school. Both the toddler and preschool classes are open to new children this fall.


Here in the International District, Elaine Ko and Linda Ramos of Inter*im had been talking about setting up a daycare cooperative. The cooperative, Ko said, would serve employees in the District who have children and have to work.


""We haven't gotten any further on the idea."" Ko said. This she remarked, is because of Inter*im understaffing. However, the idea may resurface as a future project, she said.

The 27th birthday of the founding of the People's Republic of China was celebrated October 2 at a program sponsored by the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association. Featured speaker Carma Hinton, an American woman raised in China, spoke of her first-hand experiences during the Cultural Revolution of the mid-60's.


Notable changes were made in the university system, during the Cultural Revolution, she said.


""University professors used to treat the students like the enemy giving them sneak attacks in the form of surprise tests,"" she said, ""and they never allowed discussion in class, only expected the students to memorize the lessons."" Hinton suggested this style of education was based on Soviet model adopted by China after the 1949 revolution.


During the Cultural Revolution, the education system changed Professors were no longer allowed to run a class without student input. ""During this time,"" Hinton said, ""the students found that Chairman Mao was supportive of their cause."" She said Mao stated that professors should not blame students for falling asleep in their classes but they should improve their manner of teaching and then the students would be more eager to learn.


Hinton also spoke of the struggle against sexism in China. She said great changes had taken place since the Revolution and that women were so oppressed before the revolution that at first even small changes were welcomed enthusiastically.


Hinton, who now teaches in an East Coast American college, speaks fluent Chinese and considers China her ""home.""


About 400 people attended the event at Seattle Center, including many Chinese Americans.

Lack of proficiency in the English language is a major impediment to the growth of Asian American business, according to a socio-economic analysis conducted for the Department of Commerce.


The analysis, prepared by Amsun Associates of New Rochelle, New York, also concluded that Asian Americans ""are not in the mainstream"" of American business or competitive with other businesses.


Asian American businesses are predominantly in retailing and service, according to the study. The difficulty in obtaining commercial funding and lack of familiarity with federally-supported business financing and management assistance programs contributes to weaknesses in business development by Asian Americans, according to the analysis.


The study, prepared for the Commerce Department's Office of Minority Business Enterprise, recommends increased government assistance to improve basic language skills and business management knowledge and skills. The study also recommended increasing the availability and amounts of capital for financing Asian American businesses and providing the management and technical assistance with which Asians can secure government contracts.

On January 19, 1977, President Gerald R. Ford, as one of his last official acts, pardoned Iva Ikuko Toguri.


This marked the end of a long vigilance for justice for a tragic victim of a legend. Iva Toguri had been accused, convicted, and punished for being the legendary ""Tokyo Rose"".


guest column She was convicted in 1949 of treason in an atmosphere of post-war racism and hysteria.


A remarkable Asian woman


Iva's persistance should have waned in light of the deadends, cost, and public attitude. But Iva, being a remarkable Asian woman, exhibited great quality in continuing her struggle. She maintained her innocence and relying on her cultural value of perseverance, finally won.


The pardon, although it does not exonerate her, does regrant her citizenship, which had been stripped.


Although born in Los Angeles, Iva Toguri's roots extend to the International District. Her father, Jun, was an Issei who was a naturalized citizen of Canada. He was a businessman who had dealings all along the West Coast, including Seattle's Chinatown. Iva occasionally accompanied him on trips and met and still retains friends in the Seattle area.


The elder Toguri seemed to possess some influence during those early days. He assisted a young pregnant Issei woman from being deported. His efforts in dealing with immigration authorities allowed the woman to give birth to and raise a Canadian Nisei, S.I. Hayakawa.


An ill aunt in Japan


Soon after her graduation from UCLA, in 1941, Iva was selected by her family to care for a seriously ill aunt in Japan. After the war broke out, she became stranded. She was harassed and ostracized for not renouncing her American citizenship.


She was forced to take a job with Radio Tokyo and later coerced into broadcasting to Allied servicemen. The scripts were written by Allied POW's, primarily Americans. During this time she continually assisted POW's with food, cigarets, and medicine. Still she refused to denounce America.


She was only one of 13 other female broadcasters, many of whom were Japanese Americans.


After the war, she was incarcerated for over a year without charge or counsel by the U.S. Army.


Many of her civil rights were denied, but that was only the beginning. She voluntarily returned to the U.S. to see her family, and soon after arrested for treason.


The trial was a judicial farce. It was held in San Francisco, a center of anti-Japanese racism.


She was imprisoned for nearly two years before the trial even began. Only white jurors were accepted, the defense was not allowed to bring Japanese witnesses from Japan to the U.S., but the prosecution brought over 19. She was doomed.


Witnesses bribed


Iva was found guilty on one of eight counts of treason for allegedly airing the words: ""Orphans of the Pacific, you really are orphans now. How will you get home, now that all your ships are sunk?""


The witnesses, whose crucial testimony convicted her later admitted to lying and being bribed and coerced into their testimony by the government.


For broadcasting those words, Iva was sentenced to 10 years in prison, fined $10,000, and lost her citizenship. She served over 6 years and borrowed to pay the fine. Her father recently died and left his estate to cover the remaining portion of the fine.


Shadow of constant harassment


Iva Toguri's ordeal was not over. She still lived in the shadow of constant harassment from the media, from the stigma of the stereotype of being ""Tokyo Rose"", and from the knowledge she was innocent but merely a victim of the racist attitude of that time.


The Toguri case, however unique, epitomizes a general attitude of prejudice reflected in laws and thought regarding Asians. The Alien Land Laws, the various miscegenation laws, the earlier laws preventing Isseis from becoming citizenships were only a few of the organized prejudices against Asians.


Korean women harassed


Even today problems exist. An example could be the plight of Korean women. Many have been abandoned by their servicemen husbands and forced to work in saunas.


Legal authorities have continually marked and harassed their businesses. Licensing has, until recently, discriminated against them and their English limitations, in terms of testing.


The experiences of recent immigrant. Asians magnify prejudicial problems.


A variety of movies concerning ""Tokyo Rose"" were released. The image of ""Tokyo Rose"" as a seductive, mysterious, exotic, sinister, and willing. ""Oriental"" woman was perpetuated by Suzy Wong later.


Iva Toguri's pardon allowed her to regain her valued citizenship and faith that America can ultimately be just. For the rest of us, it restores a certain amount of hope in our justice system and proof that concentrated, collective efforts can have an impact on our society.

""Across Oceans of Dreams"" is a play written and directed by 19-year-old Timoteo Cordova. The play was produced by Filipino Youth Activities (FYA) and presented at the Langston Hughes Center February 25 and 26.


The play tells, in words, music and dance, the story of two Filipinos who come to America because, as they have been told, it is a land of golden opportunity.


According to the program, ""Juan and Adriano join the vast army of Pinoys who go through the yearly cycle of Alaska canneries in the summer, agricultural fields of California and Washington in the fall and spring, and possible unemployment in the winter.


""Circumstances separate the two friends. Juan follows the rootless life of the bachelor, while Adriano continues his education, marries and raises a family.""


Timoteo Cordova, in an interview with the Examiner, said, ""I didn't write about the fields and the canneries on purpose.""


He emphasized the story of Adriano. ""Recent plays have depicted the life of the Filipino pioneers,"" he said, ""but rarely have these included the many men who had married -- usually a non-Filipino -- and raised families despite financial and social hardships.""


Cordova said he wanted to ""deal with a different area, but one that still has a lot to do with Filipinos.""


The character of Adriano, when he became older, was the combination of two men, Cordova said.


""I tried to show, one thing, that Filipinos did make it through school,"" he said. ""And that, two, there were men that didn't go to school, but worked their asses off to put their kids through school.


""I was thinking of my grandfather when I wrote that.""


There has been criticism that the play showed the hopes and dreams of the Filipinos without depicting the harsh realities they encountered.


""You can succeed,"" Cordova said. ""That's what I tried to show -- is that if a Filipino tries he can succeed.""


Cordova said the early pioneers took all the prejudices in stride. ""They didn't let it get them down,"" he said. ""They didn't let it stop them from becoming someone.""


The third act of the play opens with a solo dance routine, which sums up the feelings Cordova is conveying in ""Across Oceans of Dreams."" Cordova's poem, ""Pledge of Alliance,"" is read during the dance.


Of this he says, ""I wanted to show Filipinos that they should be proud of being Filipino, yes, but they should also be proud of their other heritage, and that's being American.


""I look at America not as an assembled area, but as the people.""


The last line of the play depicts Adriano's dependence on Juan. Adriano has not forgotten his roots.


""I never told this to you, Juan, but I have a lot of respect for you,"" Adriano says. ""Even after we split up. I made it through school, but it was actually you who put me through school.


""We've gone through a lot together, you and I, and it hasn't been to nice.


""But if I had the chance to do it again, yes, I'd come across those oceans, across those oceans of dreams.""


""Across, Oceans of Dreams."" has undergone some revisions and will be presented again April 2 in Pigott Auditorium at Seattle University. For more information, call the FYA office, 323-6545.

The Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs was created by the State Legislature several years ago in response to the lack of access by the state's Asian American population to the official policymakers in Olympia. At that time, the Legislature finally recognized Asian Americans have unique and special problems which required attention.


The Commission was set up to facilitate the participation of Asian Americans in government, business, and education and to insure Asian Americans access to government services. A chief Commission function has been to identify. Asian 'American problems so policy makers in Olympia consider the needs of Asian Americans before making decisions. In addition, the Commission has lobbied for the appointment of Asian Americans to the various state boards end commissions, to facilitate participation of Asian Americans in all fields.


Commissioners are appointed by the Governor, representing Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese segments from both Eastern and Western Washington.


Largely through the efforts of Commission Director Mitch Matsudaira and his staff (including interns and administrative aides), Asian Americans in Washington State have their needs voiced at the state capitol.


Accomplishments include setting up positions in state agencies to deal with Asian American concerns. Two examples are: the setting up of an Asian desk (to act, investigate and insure delivery of services to Asian clients) at the State's Department of Social and Health Services, and establishment of an Asian American Bi-lingual Consultant with the State Superintendant of Public Instruction (to lobby and help supervise delivery of bi-lingual education for Asian Americans in the public schools).


Among its many achievements, was the establishement of the Vietnamese Relocation Assistance Center at Camp Murray. The Commission was instrumental in the orderly resettlement of Vietnamese refugees who fled to the United States after US involvement in the Vietnam War ended.


In 1973, the Commission (then known as the Washington State Asian American Advisory Council) conducted public hearings on discrimination against Asian Americans.


Pursuant to the hearings, the Commission made recommendations to improve the status and treatment of Asians in these areas. Since that time, progress has been made in most areas. While not all of the recommendations have been carried out, the Commission has lobbied for change at the official level (such as pushing the Legislature toward better treatment of foreign professionals) and, at least, started ""the ball rolling"" for Asian community groups to initiate change.


The Commission is scheduled to automatically expire June 30, 1977. It was born in response to the well-nurtured myth that ""Asians had no problems."" When Asian Americans finally opened up and publicly advocated social change after recognizing the existence of discrimination, the State created a Commission to identify and investigate.


Has the Commission outlived its usefulness? Is it a relic of the past?


There have been moves in the past to abolish the Commission and to put its function within the Washington. State Human Rights Department. The main problem is that the Commission has been advocacy-oriented while the Human Rights Commission is primarily investigatory. It is important to keep these separate, as Human Rights has a huge backlog of cases and there is the potential for the needs of Asians to get ""lost in the shuffle.""


Has the Commission on Asian American Affairs outlived its usefulness? Currently, the Commission is involved in:


1) the future well being of the Indochinese refugees when federal resettlement funds expire in 1977;


2) the need for comprehensive bilingual education and training programs;


3) implementation of better government service delivery to the Asian community.


There is a bill (House Bill 138), pending in the State Legislature, to extend the life of the Commission to June 30, 1983. In 1970, there were 44,000 Asian Americans in the state. Today, there are an estimated 68,000 Asians. If the Commission does expire, 68,000 people will lose their ""voice"" in Olympia. The needs of 68,000 people could be ""benignly"" neglected, given the size of the state bureaucracy.


Certainly today, there are still many inadequacies in the State's treatment of Asian Americans. A Commission advocating Asian American concerns can only improve conditions.


The Examiner supports the bill to extend the Commission until 1983 and it urges its readers, Asian and non-Asian, to write their state senators and state representatives in support House Bill 138.


It is not time to speak of the Commission in the past tense. Hopefully, the Commission's most notable accomplishments lie ahead. This is a story that needs to be continued.

The article in this issue concerning the process by which an alien can become an American citizen raises some serious questions about this procedure.


One application form question concerns communism. The way this question is worded, a person could have investigated Communist Party activities out of curiosity and if that person were to answer this question truthfully he or she could be denied citizenship.


Why is the Communist Party singled out?


There are other parties opposed to the republican/democratic form of government here in the United States. The fascist dictatorships of South Korea, India, Chile and the Philippines are good examples. These governments have denied all civil liberties to the people of their countries and have violently suppressed even peaceful opposition.


And yet the U.S. supports these governments with millions of dollars and military aid.


So, if the U.S. is trying to ""weed out"" those opposed to a republican democracy, why not ask about fascists and all others who believe in a different form of government?


The application form also asks, all in one question, if the applicant ""believed in polygamy...received income mostly from illegal gambling; committed adultery, have been or procured a prostitute...helped an alien to enter the U.S. illegally;...illicit trafficker in illegal drugs...or have been a habitual drunkard? Have you ever, anywhere, committed any of these acts?""


Again we find a restriction on a person's beliefs. The form doesn't ask ""have you practiced polygamy"" but merely ""do you believe in polygamy.""


Here we see the hypocrisy of a government that demands a certain code of ethics from those not yet citizens and does nothing about the lack of ethics in its own government officials. The Examiner feels that, although a person's past should be given some consideration, immigration officials should be more concerned with what an applicant intends to do in the future.


The naturalization examination is geared to the applicant. That is, the better educated a person, the more technical and difficult the examination. This recalls the old joke, ""All men are created equal, but some are more equal than others.""


Shouldn't the test be basically the same for all? Why make it harder on someone just for being better educated?


Those of us educated in this country were constantly being taught that America is great because each individual has equal rights. Shouldn't these rights be extended to those we are welcoming as new citizens?

Four alternative theatre groups have combined to form Theatre Seattle Foundation, in a move which may benefit not only alternative theatre and the city of Seattle, but the International District as well.


Theatre Seattle Foundation is made up of four resident companies: the Asian Exclusion Act, the Red Earth Performing Company (Native American theatre), the Open Theatre Project (political theatre), and the Womyn's Theatre (feminist theatre).


They are negotiating to occupy and renovate a building at 407-413 Seventh Ave. So Located on Seventh So between Jackson and King Streets, the split-level building now houses auto repair and taxicab meter services. Renovation of the building would ultimately provide the groups with two different performing areas, offices, dressing rooms, storage areas, and shop space.


The groups combined forces to fulfill a specific need. Unlike more established theatre companies, such as A.C.T. or the Seattle Repertory, alternative theatre companies are newer, possibly community-based groups. Often they are nonprofit and must rely on volunteer services and donations.


Their most critical, most expensive, and most regular need is for space -- office, rehearsal, performing, breathing space.


Theatre Seattle Foundation hopes to fulfill that need and provide other resource services, as well: publicity resource services, theatre technical advisors, job actor pools, and a listing of opportunities for traveling shows, which would benefit both the companies and any potential audiences. It hopes to serve not only the resident companies, but visiting companies as well. The building might also be available for non-theatrical use, such as meetings or classes.


If the project goes through, it will have some positive impact on the District. The theatre would be economically beneficial. It can draw people into the I.D. who will add to the revenue of the District's businesses. The renovation of the building itself would be another addition to the District's continual, albeit gradual, improvement program.


Theatre Seattle Foundation would also return live, homegrown theatre to the District, something which has been missing since the close of the Nipponkan. This factor was a prime incentive for the Asian Exclusion Act's involvement in the project.


""We want to bring Asian American theatre to our people,"" says one member of the group, ""and having our base in the I.D. would really bring us home.""


Theatre Seattle Foundation hopes to open its doors this summer, with the Asian Exclusion Act giving the opening performance in August. No terms have yet been finalized, however, and if that should occur, there is still much remodeling which must take place. To do that, Theatre Seattle Foundation a non-profit organization, is waging an extensive fund-raising campaign aimed at private sources, as well as applying for CETA and block grant monies.


For more information on the project contact Denis Warren or Mary Schulz at 324-5565.

There are Asian psychologists, but ""not enough Asian American psychologists,"" a University of Washington instructor said during an April convention of the Association of Asian-American Psychologists (AAP).


The participants at the 57th annual Western Psychological Association Convention, held April 22 at the Olympic Hotel, assessed the role of the Asian American psychologist and the needs of the Asian American mental health patient.


Dr. Stanley Sue, pointing to the lack of ""Asian American psychologists,"" said a large number of Asian psychologists are foreign-born and deal with issues that concern their homeland. Asian American problems are then overlooked, he said.


The President's Commission on Mental Health had sent a letter to the president of AAP, Dr. Bob Chin of Boston University, asking for advice on Asian problems in mental health. Chin, the first Asian American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1947, in turn notified AAP members to draw up recommendations.


Approximately 20 individuals attended the meeting. There were psychology graduates and undergraduates, representatives from social services (Asian American Alliance, the University of Washington Equal Opportunity Program) and a few professors.


Sue, who chaired the meeting, said the Asian patient seeking psychiatric help encounters barriers.


The patient, he said, may have shame or lack knowledge about where to go to find help. The patient may not want to go to a public facility, he continued, and ""if they go, the response (from the psychiatrist) may be quite adverse to them.""


Sue said the Asian patient may not know where to go ""purely for information"" and face financial problems.


""If the patient also doesn't know English, finding a bilingual therapist is difficult,"" said Sue.


The group at the conference cited the lack of visibility of Asian Americans. For example, they pointed out, the President's Commission on Mental Health has no Asians on the board to represent Asian needs. The group pointed to the stereotype of Asians as self-sufficient and without mental health problems.


Sue cited an example of an Asian American community's response to its lack of visibility. He said that several years ago, when orphans from Southeast Asian countries such as Laos arrived in the United States, California decreed that no Asians could adopt them. The state felt, Sue said, that the process of assimilation could be speeded up by non-Asians adopting the orphans. The Asian community fought the decree and won, he said.


Dr. James Morishima, University of Washington professor in Higher Education, recommended that mental health research and prevention be continued and stressed.


Morishima said that under the Ford Administration the National Institute for Mental Health stressed the biological sciences and tended to neglect research and prevention.


""A grant was given to the Navaho Indians to learn the art of the Medicine Men,"" he said. ""I hope there is the same possibility for Asian Americans (to learn about Asian American culture).""


Sue said some Asian American problems are unique. He cited the Maslow Theory which says a person's lower needs for food, clothing and shelter must be fulfilled before higher needs such as esteem and social status.


But this is not true for Asian Americans, Sue said. ""Higher needs take precedence over lower needs,"" he said. The UW professor said early Asian immigrants would live under intolerable conditions and would send their wages back to their homeland.


Daisuke Bill Nakashima, a staff member at McNeil Island Prison, said, ""We believe we're a specific group, so we believe we are a problem.""


Nakashima said many Asians ""deny they're Oriental.""


""Cognitive view is extremely important,"" Sue added. ""Perhaps someone treats you differently, not because of race, but you think so."" It is a cognitive problem, he said. If you see life (as) unenjoyable and everything (being) racist, you will see everything due to racism.""

The University of Washington Board of Regents last month approved the appointment of a major Filipino American novelist to be visiting professor in Asian American Studies and English.


Nestor Vicente Madali (N.V.M.) Gonzalez, professor of English at California State University in Hayward, will serve as visiting professor for three quarters, beginning March 16.


Gonzalez is the winner of major Philippine literary awards and former associate professor of English and comparative literature at the University of the Philippines in Manila.


Gonzalez was a participant in the Pacific Northwest Asian American Writers Conference held at the University of Washington last summer. He gave a public lecture, ""The Planting and Harvesting of Metaphors, Or the Stories We Can Tell.""


He said at the Conference, ""It is the kind of thing that we put our material in which determines whether it will be useful or not. Do you realize the sentence as a form? It is the form we need to work with.""


""The most beautiful experience, without the bottle to put it in, is nothing.""


""The job of the artist,"" Gonzalez said, ""is to make things come alive. He is like a fairy with a wand. When he touches the object, it comes alive.""

There's a test immigrants have to take if they want to become citizens of this country.


But they have to have resided in the United States for five years before they can apply to become a naturalized citizen. If the immigrant is married to an American citizen, the period of mandatory waiting is three years.


Can you pass?


This means several years to study


The Examiner tried some of the citizenship exam questions on American-born folks, who are automatically citizens of this republic by virtue of their place of birth. Many of the questions they could not answer. They said it was a good thing they were born here.


Dan P. Danilov, a noted attorney specializing in immigration law, was interviewed by the Examiner.


He explained that the test is not as difficult as it looks. Immigrants are asked samplings of the study guide questions, he said, and the technicality of the exam is geared to the educational background and occupation of the applicant.


Thus, Danilov said, a lawyer would have a more detailed test than a factory worker.


Basic comprehension


He said the immigration examiners are testing to see if the applicant has a basic comprehension of the United States form of government and a citizen's rights.


He added that children under 18 can be included on their parent's petition and that the qualifications for elderly are very minimal.


Another aspect of the naturalization process is the application to file petition for naturalization.


""Most people think that the petition is made to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS),"" said Danilov, ""but the petition is made to the federal courts. The INS assists the courts in this matter.""


It is the judge's decision, not the immigration examiner, that determines one's citizenship. Thus, if an examiner decides to recommend denial of U.S. citizenship, the applicant can appeal directly to the judge.


Not that simple


All of this sounds fine, but upon closer inspection the process is not as simple as it looks.


Some of the questions on the application to file petition for naturalization would be comical if the circumstances were not so serious.


One question asks if the applicant has ever ""knowingly committed any crime for which you have not been arrested."" The applicant must answer yes or no.


One question asks if the applicant has ever ""been a member of, or in any other way connected or associated with the Communist Party."" Then the question goes on to ask if the applicant has ""ever knowingly aided or supported the Communist Party directly, or indirectly through another organization, group or person."" Finally, it is asked if the applicant either now or some time in the past ""advocated, taught, believed in or knowingly supported or furthered the interest of Communism.""


Moral character


Does the applicant have ""good moral character?"" Here's how question 15 reads.


""The law provides that you may not be regarded as qualified for naturalization if, at any time during the period for which you are required to prove good moral character, you believed in polygamy or have been a polygamist, received income mostly from illegal gambling committed adultery; have been a prostitute or procured anyone for prostitution, or have knowingly for gain encouraged or helped an alien to enter the United States illegally, or have been an illicit trafficker in drugs or marijuana, or have been a habitual drunkard.


""Have you ever,"" the question reads, ""anywhere, been such a person or committed any of these acts?""


The applicant must answer yes or no.


Equal right?


Acceptance of the applicant as a citizen does not, however, insure equal rights under the Constitution.


If a naturalized citizen is found to have been associated with the Communist Party or to have committed acts such as those listed in the application form, that person's citizenship can be revoked and he or she can face deportation.

If you've gone down King St. looking for the Chinese Baptist Church lately try again.


The new church is on the corner of Beacon Ave. S. and Orcas St. It's been open at the new location since November 14.


Reverend Paul Szeto, pastor of the church, says the growth of the congregation was the reason for the new church. The increase in the church's population, he says, is due to ""the sense of ethnic identity"" the church provides.


""People feel at home and have a sense of belonging,"" he said.


During the Depression, Rev. Szeto said, ""everybody thought the melting pot theory was the answer. But each culture has its own distinction and differences."" He related the change in attitude to the rainbow theory: all seven colors are distinct, but work together in America.


The new church site is due, in part; to a survey the church conducted to find out the location of the highest concentration of Asians. The survey took approximately six to seven months. The results came out in May, 1972. At that time, the growth of the church became very apparent.


Rev. Szeto said, ""The location was closer to the people on Beacon Hill"" where most of the congregation resides. In 1971, the population of the King St. church was 125. The membership is now 500 and still growing. In 1972, it was decided that the old church just couldn't hold all its members, Szeto said.


The construction of the new church, which began in 1974, took approximately two years. The cost of the property was $60,000. The church lost $500,000, but the loss is being made up from money which has been raised.


There were according to Szeto no major problems resulting from the transition.


""We were all excited about it."" he said.


There were of course sentimental feelings, he said, but in working together the mood has changed.


There were reasons, besides the growth of the church, for finding a new location Rev. Szeto said the church has good lay leadership. There are also many groups which make up the church: teenagers, Christian women and men's groups, Chinese couples and adult fellowships held monthly.


It seems that the new church offers facilities for all these groups.


The church sanctuary offers seating for 400. The church also has: a large fellowship hall for education, a library, youth center, lounge, administrative area, nursery and infant room, and kitchen facilities capable of preparing food for more than 300 people.


Mr. John Y.F. Ho is the ministerial assistant and Mrs. Tammy Wong is the church's secretary.


The ""old"" Chinese Baptist Church was purchased by the American Legion.

A great number of Filipinos are lured to this country by the illusion that America is the land of milk and honey. As a result, there has been a significant influx of immigrants here in the last four to five years.


John Ragudos, executive administrator of the Filipino Youth Association (FYA), said, ""Because of the new quota system law, immigration has allowed 20,000 to 30,000 Filipinos to come in this country. This system enabled Filipinos to fill quotas of other countries that were not filled.""


In fact, Filipinos rank number one in population among the eight Asia groups in this country, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service annual reports, 1965 to 1975.


The Filipino Youth Association has been concerned with problems of Filipino immigrants. Out of this concern, the organization completed a study on immigrants in July, 1976. Statistics were compiled. Problems affecting immigrants were defined and programs designed to solve those problems.


Since its founding in 1957, the FYA, a non-profit organization, has been the only Filipino American organization in the United States devoted solely to providing multi-program social services to youth of all races.


""Immigrants are probably the ones who have required our utmost attention,"" said Bob Bioko, FYA immigrant specialist. Because of the enormous influx of immigrants, FYA is presently in dire need of volunteers. Immigrants face numerous diverse problems, therefore, FYA is unable to set priorities as to which problem should be attended to first.


""When the immigrants arrive and encounter their first difficulty,"" Bioko said, ""they call us, sometimes because the Philippine Consulate refers them to us or because we're about the only place that is open during the day. But most of the time, they call us because we have provided them services before and because they like to keep in contact.""


Employment: number one problem


The FYA staff feels the most difficult problem facing immigrants is employment.


A study of the socio-economic characteristics of ethnic minorities, based on the 1970 census, shows the average Filipino immigrant between the ages of 25 and 44 has acquired more than a college degree. And the Immigration and Naturalization Service annual reports of 1965 to 1975 show that Filipino immigrants rank number one in the category of professional, technical, clerical and household workers.


Since the Philippines, as a whole, has a high turnout of college graduates not absorbed into the labor market, many prefer to leave the country.


""They come to the U.S.,"" Ragudos said, ""because America's illusion of being the land of milk and honey is still real and that they envision better opportunities here.""


Specialist Bioko tries to provide employment opportunities for Filipino immigrants. The employment problem professional immigrants face is one of the most difficult to solve, Bioko says. ""Once they arrive, they are forced to take low-paying jobs to remain and to prevent going back to the Philippines,"" he says. ""They are afraid to face their countrymen and to admit they were a failure.""


Ragudos added, ""They have to work like hell to get over here, some have had to wait for as long as five years to save money. But once they get here, they have to wait at least six months or longer to get a job.""


According to the 1975 annual report of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington State ranks number six in the number of Filipino immigrants admitted annually. Washington follows California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and New Jersey, respectively.


""A lot of them could come here and then move out to the different states for employment opportunities, but through friends or relatives, they find out which state is ideal for such opportunities prior to coming here,"" Bioko said.


Licensing requirement


He said the main concern of the professional immigrant is the licensing requirement. Others are not even aware of such a problem prior to coming, he said. Bioko noted that some states have more lenient laws than others. Ragudos thinks states with stringent laws are discriminating because they don't want the entry of immigrants.


""We (FYA) were involved in state legislation and lobbying before to help loosen some of these restrictive licensing requirements, but it is now the primary task of the Demonstration Project for Asian Americans,"" said Ragudos. ""They are working specifically for the professional immigrants and their problems.


Then there's the work experience problem to contend with. Even educated immigrants have problems acquiring a job without work experience.


""Employees do not necessarily state they are over-qualified because, according to the law, no one is over-qualified,"" Bioko said. ""To be over-qualified means one is qualified and they are usually given some other reasons why they are not hired.


Language difficulties


The FYA staff feels inadequate communication skills or language difficulties have been reasons for discrimination. Bioko feels that, despite learning English as a second language in the Philippines, immigrants still have difficultites. He pointed out that in the Philippines more emphasis is placed on writing than on practical verbal skills. Slangs and pronunciation are the major causes of the difficulty.


The FYA staff is particularly optimistic about the Seattle Public Schools bilingual program and its effect on immigrant school children. Ragudos feels bilingual tutoring will speed up the language learning process and perhaps motivate children to do well in school.


""Part of the problem,"" said Ragudos, ""is that the books and the lessons are designed like, everyone was born here.""


FYA itself held summer colloquial conversation classes which to date, have not been very successful.


Presently, FYA is cooperating with Seattle Opportunities Industrial Center and the Employment Opportunity Center to provide employment training and information about interview policies and career opportunities. In addition, FYA is trying to obtain federal funding to implement training programs. But Ragudos was doubtful FYA would obtain money. ""People are still unaware of the problems Filipinos face, unaware that there are Filipinos here, he said. They are just plain unaware.""

A commemorative exhibition of the photographic works of the late Dr. Kyo Koike, a Seattle resident who became an internationally known photographer, is scheduled to go on display at the Wing Luke Museum May 26 to June 26.


This will mark the first post-war showing of Koike's works.


Koike, a physician, came to Seattle in 1917 from Shimane Prefecture, Japan. According to Caral Zabilski, in an article published in the April issue of ""Pacific Northwest Quarterly,"" Dr. Koike was introduced to a camera shortly after his arrival. Within five years, he gained an international reputation.


""His prints,"" wrote Zabilski, ""were exhibited in the salons of Europe, Japan, the United States, and South America, and his articles and photographs appeared in photography and art journals published in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Poland, England, America, and elsewhere.


Koike's school of art photography was known as pictorialism, which traditionally centered on manipulation of negatives and prints. However, Koike chose natural subjects, primarily landscapes, and used soft-focus treatments. He emphasized photographic techniques rather than darkroom gimmickry.


""Pictorial work,"" Koike once wrote, ""is the product of the photographer's mental abilities, and we use the apparatus only for the means to express our ideas.""


""But more,"" Zabiliski wrote, ""Koike pictorialism represented something new in art photography: the influence of Japanese artistic tradition upon Western invention.


""With a strong background in his native art and literature, Dr. Koike perceived the beneficial effects that Asian culture could have upon pictorial photography. The traditions of Japanese woodblock prints and sumi paintings were especially valuable, for their principles of arrangement and shading in a black and white medium applied perfectly to photography.""


Koike was also an established poet, writing under the pen name Banjin. In 1934, he helped start the Rainier Ginsha, a Seattle haiku society.


""As a haiku poet, Koike brought to photography the simplicity and spareness of his poetry,"" Zabilski stated. ""In both art forms, he wished to express the essential and to suggest much...""


Dr. Koike, she wrote, believed that the role of the poet and photograper was ""to evoke for the reader and viewer the beauty and atmosphere the poet-photographr had experienced.""


In 1923, he helped form the Seattle Camera Club, a group of 40 Japanese amateur photographers. The Club published a bilingual bulletin, ""Notan"" (dark and light), edited by Koike.


The group also encouraged multiracial participation in its membership and activities, but whites ignored their offers.


Nonetheless, the Club sponsored several salons with numerous non-Japanese participants. There were occasions when its members contributed their works in shows and competitions outside the country.


""They won acclaim for themselves and recognition for the city that refused to acknowledge them,"" wrote Zabilski.


Dr. Koike and other Japanese on the West Coast were sent to concentration camps during World War II. Koike's camera was taken from him. He returned to Seattle after the war and passed away in 1947.

""Every culture has a concept of others which makes them less than human beings. We destroy each other in wiping Earth clear of people not like us,"" stated Dr. Dean Barnlund at a recent PACASIAN Intercultural Conference.


The conference was held at Seattle Central Community College April 29, 30 and May 1.


Dr. Barnlund director of intercultural studies at the American University in Japan, was one of four speakers at the conference which focused on intercultural and interpersonal communication. There were approximately 40 people at the conference, mostly educators and administrators.


Barnlund said the tremendous improvement of modern transportation has caused erosion of intercultural barriers. ""We are no longer segregated from the diversity or variety of cultures,"" he said ""The erosion of the (intercultural) barriers points out our inadequacies of our attempts to deal with other cultures.""


""There are four stages which all of us have to go through before we can understand another culture,"" he said The first stage, he said, is where one is locked into one's own culture and evaluate the other culture based on one's own norms and standards. The second, he said, is where we become aware of something in the other culture. One does not understand it, he said, and one begins to look for other cues and signals to find the meaning. ""In the third stage, we began to notice more cues and see the significance of it,"" he said. ""We may even begin to use those cues or signals. We begin to develop insight into underlying dynamics of the culture in the fourth stage.""

It's a fine . . . of Japanese American life in the year preceeding Internment. Everyone that's seen it has really enjoyed it, many have empathized with the characters, all have learned something. But the Asian Exclusion Act needs your support.


The Asian Exclusion Act offered its support recently to another community organization. Over 130 persons attended a special benefit performance of Gold Watch, all proceeds of which went to the Seattle Keiro Nursing Home. It was their second performance in one day, but it was well worth the extra effort. This production, incidentally, is dedicated to the Issei.


Speaking of pioneers, the Wing Luke Museum is featuring things used in the Chinese community during the early 1900's as its special Chinese New Year exhibit. Many of the objects are the legacy of Chin Gee Hee, an early railroad and cannery contrator, who returned to China to build his own railroad in the early 1900's. He left the Quong Tuck Store to his brother who became Dan Woo's great-granduncle. Dan lent the artifacts to the museum.

The Children's Play Area Committee has been recently re-established through the District Manager's office. Its suggestion is that the $90,000 allocated to the project be used to develop the play area between Hing Hay Park and the post office, and to extend the west part of Hing Hay Park into one-half of Maynard Avenue. The committee has requested that the Seattle Park Department, which controls the money, provide the funds to hire an architect who would develop the plans. The Park Department has not yet responded to the request. Previously, the Park Department had threatened to re-allocate the play area money to another project, but the quick work of City Council Members Miller and Lamphere prevented that.


In 1976, the Alaska Cannery Workers Association received a $2500 grant to produce a photo history of Asian Americans in the Northwest salmon industry. The photo show, a Bicentennial project, has been shown throughout northern California. It should be displayed in Seattle sometime this spring.

A joint study by the City, King County and Metro has resulted in a published report, ""Transportation Needs of the Disabled and the Elderly.""


The report, published early this month, is the product of one of the largest studies in the United States of the transportation problems of elderly and disabled.


Jeanette Williams, Seattle City Council Member, who sponsored the study, said the report estimates 170,000 disabled and elderly persons live in King County, approximately 15 per cent of the population. Of those 170,000, she added, more than 60 per cent live in Seattle.


""The special transportation needs of this segment of the population have been virtually ignored until recently."" Ms. Williams said, ""and a coordinated, effective, public and private transportation program is essential to the independence and self-sufficiency of the elderly and disabled.


""This study will be a major resource in planning an economical, efficient transportation system serving the entire Metro area.""


Metro Council Chairperson C. Carey Donworth said data from the study will be a ""valuable aid"" in planning transportation service throughout the County.


Copies of the report are available at city and county libraries.

You don't have to be President of the United States or a recognized scientist to travel to the People's Republic of China. Since the days of Ping Pong diplomacy, over 12,000 Americans from all walks of life have visited that country.


Many persons interested in visiting China have misconceptions about the possibility of obtaining a travel visa. Although it may appear difficult, with enough patience and a reasonable purpose, one can usually get there.


In fact, one group, the local U.S.-China People's Friendship Association, is actually seeking out persons interested in traveling to China, particularly minorities and working class people (non-professional, manual labor, non-salary types). At its national convention, the Association passed a resolution calling for a minimum of two minorities and two working class participants on all of its tours.


Through its tours, the Association has sent over 4,000 Americans to China in recent years, said Bill Ziegler, chairperson of the Association's local travel committee. Tenative plans for the up-coming year include: five national, four western regional (West Coast) and two special tours, one for women and the other for Association members.


Building understanding


The U.S.-China tours seek to build understanding and friendship between the people of both countries. Each tour usually consists of 24 persons. The tour members spend 18 days in China, visiting communes, factories, schools, hospitals, tourist attractions, markets, and cultural facilities.


Each tour varies, depending upon the particular focus of the tour group. For instance, a tour for those interested in health may visit more hospitals, clinics, and other health related facilities than another tour group.


The cost of a tour ranges from $1,400 for the national tours to $2,400 for the regional friendship tours. Persons may apply for a scholarship or grant to pay up to a third of the tour cost through the Association.


In some cases, the total individual cost of the trip is paid for by the Association, Ziegler said, so that one's ability to pay for the trip is not a factor in selection. In other words, poor persons are encouraged to apply.


The local Association sends six to nine persons to China each year. Next year, they plan to send 11 persons from this area


Local minorities


The possibility for local minorities to go to China is good, said Ziegler Interested persons, however, should apply and get interviewed early in the year, perhaps four to five months before a scheduled tour, he said. (Persons interested in going to China should phone 632-7632 or 622-2800, earlier callers receiving a better chance of going.)


The selection criteria centers on one's willingness to talk about China upon returning, one's attitude towards learning and understanding China, and the applicants desire to attend the required orientation sessions about that country. In the past, the Association selected persons from a wide range of backgrounds -- housewives, engineers, longshoremen, community workers, trade workers, teachers, and others.


Another group, the Guardian Newspaper based in New York City, also sends tours to China. Its tours typically recruit particular groups -- such as trade unionists, artists, teachers, women -- depending upon the specific focus of the tour.


Another large group of persons, mostly scientists and government officials, go to China by special invitation of the Chinese government or by making a request through the State Department.


Some individuals and groups have gone to China by successfully applying for visas by writing the People's Republic of China Liaison Office in Washington, D.C. or the consulate office in Toronto, Canada. The number who use this method to get to China is relatively small compared to the other alternatives.


Chinese with relatives


Chinese in the United States with relatives in China usually get accepted, but because of the tremendous backlog in processing applications, they normally have to wait a year or longer for a response. American businesspersons who apply sometimes get invited to the Canton Trade Fair, held in the spring and fall each year. Otherwise, individual applicants are seldom approved by Peking.


Tourist-type individuals can forget about applying. It is simply not the People's Republic of China's bag at this time to establish commercial tourism. Going to a travel agency to get to China, then, would be fruitless.


One major reason the Chinese do not accommodate greater numbers of tours and individuals from the U.S. is the lack of Chinese who can interpret in English. It is not that they don't want more people from the U.S. there. At any one time, there are numerous tours and individuals from foreign countries visiting China.


The Chinese will accommodate more foreign visitors in the future as more translaters are trained. In the future, then, one can expect to see more Americans traveling to China, provided U.S. China relations remain stable.

""We see many more Asians (in court) now than we did in 1969 when I first started,"" said King County Superior Court Judge Warren Chan in a recent interview.


Before, Asians had not been in contact with the criminal justice system he said, but now they are involved in all crimes. ""In the earlier days, if it wasn't gambling, it was opium. Those were about the two major crimes in which the Chinese were involved in,"" said Chan, ""but now we see them in everything, assault, murder, robbery, burglary and drug violations.""


Many crimes seem to be committed to support drug habits. When asked about a solution to the drug problem, Chan said a lot of it had to do with the way a person is raised, what the parents require and the peers of the person involved. ""I suppose the solutions are as wide and as difficult as the reasons,"" he said, ""I suppose the best solution is education. It's a tremendous problem. I don't think I have any answer for it.""


Chan, who was elected in 1968, served in private practice 18 years before becoming Superior Court Judge.


""Being a judge is a very interesting life,"" he said. ""The court deals with people in all walks of life, from the very low to the very high.""


""The beauty of serving on the King County Superior Court is that the judge never knows from day to day what kind of case will be assigned to him or her to try.""


Chan feels there is an sufficient number of Asians in Law.


""Nationwide, there are not too many,"" said Chan. ""In the state of Washington, I would say that there are between 8 to 10 lawyers of Chinese ancestry. If we were to include all Asians, there are probably 20 to 25.""


Economics has a substantial impact on individuals who commit, crimes according to Chan. The majority of the people who come before the court for felonies, are not well trained to perform any good job.


""Once in a while we have an individual who is highly trained or well educated,"" said Chan, ""but that's the exception, that's really the category of white collar crime.""


""But the normal felon that comes before us is age 18 to 28,"" he said. ""Some have high school educations and probably a majority of them do not. The majority of them are dropouts from high school.""


Chan feels the penal system leaves much to be desired.


""The system was not designed to rehabilitate,"" he said.


In his opinion, most of our prisons are designed just for the purpose of locking people up.


""The great difficulty I suppose, is the selection process in determining which individual is susceptable to being rehabilitated."" Chan said ""We just don't have the tools to make a good selection process. But by and large we're doing well with what we have.""


Commenting on his future plans. Chan said it's open, but there's always a thought of moving up in the judiciary.


""There's a lot of politics involved. The longer a judge is a judge, the less likely his chances of moving up to the Appellate Court or Federal Judiciary,"" he said ""Because our code of ethics prevents us from being involved in politics.""

If you are not completely satisfied with Western medicine, you might want to try Chinese herbal medicine.


""Chinese herbs are organic,"" said Hen Sen Chin, Chinese herbist, ""so it agrees with your body better and it virtually has no side effects compared to Western medicine.""


Chin, owner of Hen Sen Herbs on 8th Ave. and King St. is one of two Chinese herbists in the District. The longest practicing Chinese herbist in the city, he began here some 25 years ago at the same location.


A world authority


At 23, Chin received a doctorate in Kim Chinese Medicine from Ling Nam Chinese Medical College in Hong Kong. He is considered one of the world's authorities in Chinese herbal medicine.


Over the years, an increasingly large number of non-Chinese, particularly whites, have come to his small shop for advice and to buy Chinese herbs.


""Patients from all over the United States and abroad come to him for advice,"" said Willard Jue, Chin's part-time assistant. ""He has been interviewed on TV on several occasions.""


Ying and Yang


The philosophy behind Chinese medicine is the ""Ying and Yang"" concept, with emphasis on wholeness.


""A Western doctor will limit his diagnosis to identifying the name of the patient's disease,"" Jue said. ""The Chinese doctor (herbist) traditionally goes much further. They try to find the inter-relationship between the patient's condition and his environment to find the imbalances in the way the person is living that can be corrected.""


Even the weather?


When Chin examines a client, for instance, his diagnosis goes beyond the patient's sickness. He may discuss the person's interests, hobbies, social life, or occupation in addition to their physical ailment. Sometimes, he may just talk about things like the weather.


The diagnosis of the client's problem is done through observation of the client's response, attitude, physical expression, and behavior. Chin very seldom touches the person. At the most, he examines the person's tongue.


""The first time I came here, it took him (Chin) about 45 minutes to figure out what kind of herbs I, needed,"" said a regular customer. ""He didn't even touch me.""


The person's habits, Jue said, must be adjusted to fit his environment. ""Too, much tropical fruit is bad for you if you live in an area like Seattle where there is a lack of sunshine,"" he said.


Imbalance in your metabolism?


Western-style cooking is also considered bad for your health because it has too much dry-heated (fried or broiled) food. According to Chinese thought, a great amount of fried or broiled prepared dishes will create an imbalance in one's metabolism.


Jue said, ""Chinese herbal prescriptions are much more individualized than Western medicine."" As an example he said two people can come in with a cold and can get two different prescriptions for herbs because of their difference in skin texture and the way they sniff their noses.


The stomach's the source


Chinese herbists always try to find the true source of the ailment. If a person has problems with pimples, they do not just get rid of them but the herbalist must also prescribe herbs for the stomach, which is considered the true source of the problem. The herbs cure and treat at the same time.


There are literally thousands of different herbs. A herbalist may prescribe as little as two types of herbs or as much as 20, depending upon the ailment.


Herbs are consumed by the Chinese in their regular meals and used as preventive medicine as much as it is used for alleviating ailments.


""I eat it all the time,"" said Jue, smiling. At 71, Jue is very healthy and a very active member of the community.

The Spring months of April, May and June bring many changes to the streets of Seattle's Chinatown. Not only do the trees sprout new leaves, but the city gains new faces. The faces are those of the Alaskeros waiting for dispatch to the Alaska salmon canneries.


They come from as far away as California, Oregon or Idaho. Some are young and have experienced this northward trek only a few times. Others are older and are as familiar with the streets of Seattle's Chinatown as they are with those of Stockton, San Francisco and Los Angeles.


They're waiting and hoping to make a small fortune in the salmon canneries, either to finance another year in school or perhaps just to survive until next Spring.


Almost immediately, one notices the silence between old and young. There is only an occasional acknowledgement between a young slimer and an old butcher. Perhaps, the young Alaskero hopes the manong will put in a good word about him to the foreman.


One might blame this silence on their provincial background or language differences, but what is it really about? There are too many unanswered questions in a young Alaskero's mind.


He wants to know why one has to seek work whites refuse to do. He wants to know why Pilipinos have to live segregated from the rest of the cannery crews.


The young Alaskero want to know what the manongs mean when they say, ""Bahala na.""


The manongs, in turn, have lived with their Alaskan experiences for decades. Years of living in often miserable conditions to survive can never be put in words. The young can't begin to relate to the hardships the manongs experienced under the contract system or the immense pride the manongs felt when they formed a union and ousted the contractors.


The ""young buffalos"" will have to learn for themselves what the manongs mean when they say. ""It's better now than in the past.""


Starting this month, the Examiner takes an in depth look at the Alaska canneries and the people who made them happen. The six-part series begins on page six of this issue with an article on the early history of the salmon canning industry.


In following issues, the Examiner will focus on the Chinese, Japanese and Filipino labor forces, the contract system, unionization, UCAPAWA, the McCarthy era, and the present.


Hopefully, this series of articles will allow the young Alaskero to understand the experiences of the old, so they can see what the manongs mean when they, say, ""Bahala na.""

The Re-New Cleaners is tucked between the Hong Kong Restaurant and the Hilite Cafe at 505 Maynard Ave. S. It's more than a cleaners; it's a place where customers can socialize among themselves and with Mrs. Puey King Wong, who operates the laundry.


Although she is in her 60's, she's a youthful-looking woman who works six days a week, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.


She speaks little English, so she spoke to The Examiner in Cantonese, her native tongue.


Mrs. Wong says she came to the United States in 1947. In 1948, she and her husband and a partner bought the Re-New Cleaners.


She says her customers are many and varied. ""Some of them come all the way from Tacoma to bring me their clothes to repair,"" she said. ""They say I do good repairs.


""Many of my customers are very old, started with us when we opened. Some have died now.""


Paul Ong, who works in the University of Washington's Asian American Studies Department, has written about the growth of Chinese laundries in this country. He points out that the anti-Chinese movement of the 1870's and 1880's drove Chinese out of manufacturing and construction jobs.


""In both the large and small cities,"" Ong says, ""laundering became an important source of employment.""


The wash-houses, he says, required a minimum amount of skills to operate and were ideal for ""sojourners who couldn't establish deep roots in America.


""The Chinese were able to develop and dominate the laundry trade because of their social ties. Ong says. ""Capital and manpower were pooled along common lineal or dialectal lines. Guilds were established to promote and protect the trade.


Originally, the laundries were located in white residential neighborhoods, he points out. ""As the numbers increased, the new shops dispersed further out from the ghettos and the central business districts,"" says Ong.


Many of Mrs. Wong's customers see her as more than just a laundry worker.


""Many stop by here on their way to Alaska,"" she said. ""They call me 'mom.' I've watched them grow up ""They've watched Dean (her son) grow up from a small boy to a young man.""

It's not very often that one can afford to go up the Himalayas ""just to breath the air"" as George Tsutakawa, nationally-known artist and sculptor from Seattle did.


Actually, Tsutakawa went ""trekking"" (hiking) up the slopes of the Himalayas, which had ""foothills higher than Mt. Rainier.""


""The average elevation trekkers climb at is 9,000 feet,"" Tsutakawa said, ""and (they) can get up to 17,000 feet, 3,000 feet higher than Mt. Rainier.""


The first two weeks of Tsutakawa's trip were spent with eight friends from the Seattle area, including engineers, businessmen and professors. ""They were ""just friends who decided to go because they wanted to,"" say Tsutakawa. The group left Seattle April 26.


They visited Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, where it was ""very beautiful with its temples and nice climate,"" said Tsutakawa.


""Most people go there because of (the climate),"" he said. ""Secondly, (Mt.) Everest is a starting point for all mountain climbers (not trekkers) because it's the highest and hardest to climb and the most sacred.""


""I had no special purpose in going,"" says Tsutakawa, smiling. ""We visited Katmandu and the many temples around there and then we went trekking, went almost up to 17,000 feet high. We trekked for two weeks, climbing steep hills, thousands of feet everyday. That's what we did.""


Tsutakawa traveled on his own during the first two weeks of May. He visited Darjeeling, Assan, an old county still part of India. Assan is one of several small countries nestled in a valley in the southern part of the Himalayas (near Sikkim, Nepal and Bhutan).


""From there, I went to Sikkim, now a state of India, way up in the Himalayan mountains, close to the Tibetan border,"" he said.


Tsutakawa said he saw many people up in the Himalayas. ""That is another surprising thing,"" he said. ""There are many, man9 trails that lead to these popular places and a lot of trekkers from all over the world, Italians, Australians, the French, Swedes and a lot of Japanese from Japan -- they just love to climb. So, people are just going back and forth on these remote mountain trails.""


Tsutakawa said he went to central and south India about eight years ago. But he added, ""I always wanted to go to Nepal and close to Mt. Everest.


""I had no special purpose in going, although in my own art works it has left a very profound impression -- a lot of ideas. I know it's going to affect my painting, sculpture and my philosophy.


""You get up to 16,000 (feet) and the mountains are so big and so clean and so white. You just go there to breath that air.""

The Pacific West coast salmon canning industry began with entrepreneur William Humes. He had previously been a salmon fisherman on the Kennebec River, Maine. Industrialization left the river polluted, resulting in depletion of the fisheries. In 1852, Humes moved to California to find a suitable salmon-bearing river. He found his salmon. And it was a commercially abundant source: the Sacramento River.


In 1856, he was joined by his brothers, George and John. Later, in the spring of 1864, a boyhood friend of George Hume, Andrew Hapsgood was enticed to bring his canning equipment to California. Together, they established the Hapsgood and Humes Company. It set up operation in an old scow, becoming the first salmon cannery on the West Coast. It was located at the foot of K Street in Sacramento, California.


Their first year brought 2000 cases of 48 one pound cans. The cans painted a ""fiery red"" to denote Red Salmon. They lost half to spoilage, but the remaining half was sold to an Australian market at a profit. This enabled them to pay off past debts and prepare for the season of 1865.


Hydraulic mining had been introduced to California in 1865. The sludge and sediment stirred up by the hydraulic mining method prevented salmon from spawning productively. This factor caused the Hapsgood and Humes Company to move north.


They moved as far north as the Columbia River. In 1866, at Eagle Cliff, Washington, approximately 40 miles from Astoria, the first Columbia River cannery began operation. The following year Hapsgood and Humes Company dissolved. Each of the Humes brothers and Andrew Hapsgood starting individual companies.


Post Civil War industrialization


During Post Civil War industrialization others became interested in duplicating the success of the Hapsgood and Humes. Company canneries in California and on the Columbia River. By 1881, Columbia River canneries were producing 630,000 cases.


People moving west crowded into the Columbia River towns of Oregon and Washington. Competition between cannery operations increased, and cannery owners began looking for new fishing grounds. In 1877, the first Puget Sound cannery was started at Mulkiteo by a Jackson and Myers Company.


The northward trek of canneries continued. The North Pacific Trading and Packing Company began a cannery at Klawock, Alaska. In that same year, Cutting Packing Company started a cannery at Old Sitka. In 1882, the last major salmon producing area opened. Bristol Bay.


In creating this industry, many problems had to be overcome. First, markets had to be created. Originally, only local areas bought salmon products. With the development of canned salmon came the creation of an Australian market in 1864, a South American market in 1865, and the Great Britain market in 1871, the most important one.


An important factor in marketing of canned salmon has been the influence of wars. From the very beginning of the canning industry, was has helped to create a market for canned products. Napoleon preserved food that could be easily transported by armed forces. With Nicholas Appert creator of canned, goods came the beginning of all the canning industries.


The Civil War led to a sixfold increase in all camping production a nearly inexhaustible market was created. The added technical advances during this period helped immensely to create a permanent place for the canning industry. The first major war to directly affect the salmon canning industry was the Spanish-American War, which created another important market for canned salmon. World Wars I and II both played an equally important role in creating stability in the salmon markets. At times during World War II, 90 per cent of all salmon cannery products were directed to the armies of the Axis.


Labor Forces


A lack of cheap labor has always plagued new industries. Salmon canning was no different. Whites who originally did the back-breaking work of hand butchering, hand cleaning, hand filling and hand casing of salmon refused to work for low wages. George Humes solved this dilemna in 1872 by his introduction of Chinese ""coolie"" laborers. Soon, contracted Chinese laborers began taking over the menial jobs. (Further discussion of labor forces will be taken up, in future issues.)


Mechanization


They worked for starvation wages and deprived white men and women of jobs, although only the hungry folks would do the fish cleaning very long Sometimes the white population did something about it, rioting against the yellow race running them out of town temporarily.""


This quote from ""Fish and Ships"" described the problem arising from use of Chinese to solve the labor shortage problem. A new solution had to be found.


The industry began a drive for mechanization; first with various improvements in can making in the 1870's, then with development of filling machines in the 1890's. The menial task of hand butchering was still performed by Chinese laborers. A ""clatter of China talk, a flash of long knifes, the smell of salt and cooked fish was still very much a part of cannery life,"" according to ""Fish and Ships"".


It was not until 1904 that a machine was developed to take the task of the Chinese. A machine was created by a Canadian which would, in the words of the inventor, do away with Chinamen by doing the fish cleaning so cheaply the Chinamen would go home out sheer disgust. E. A. Smith developed this machine, tagging it the ""Iron Chink."" The first machine was sent to the Red Salmon Canning Company in Bristol Bay. A second machine was sent, that same year to Anacortes, Washington. To this day, it is still called the ""Iron Chink."" The machinist who works on it is called the ""Iron Chink"" machinist.


Corporate Mergers


""People of the same trade seldom meet together ever for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some (argument) to raise prices."" This often quoted comment of Adam Smith, author of ""Wealth of Nations"" can easily be applied to the salmon canning industry Where a few canneries in close proximity could, they shared costs by closing down all but one. They produced less but at a higher profit. Chignik Bay canneries and then Karluk River canneries agreed to these terms as early as the season of 1891.


Soon even the distance between various canneries was no longer a factor in the decision to merger for profit's sake. In September, 1891 Alaska canneries had a surplus of 363,000 cases. The temporarily-formed Alaska Packers Association (APA) was created to dispose of the surplus. It was dissolved shortly after its mission was completed, but the necessity of such an organization was very much in the mind of cannery owners. In 1892 31 of 37 Alaska salmon canneries merged to become the Alaska Packers Association. They incorporated in 1893.


Alaska Packers Association


Alaska Packers Association divided Alaska in sections allowing only a few canneries in each area to operate, with the total profits divided among them, according to their share of stock. Out of 31 members in 1893, only 8 were allowed to open.


To demonstrate the power of Alaska Packers Association, the story of the ""1903 Salmon War"" must be related. The Pacific Packing and Navigation Company (PPNC) based in New Jersey, proposed to consolidate operation of a number of canneries to provide control over four-fifths of the world's market for canned salmon.


Alaska Packers Association took up the challenge. 1902 found them with 1,223,000 cases of 1901 and 1902 surplus. APA represented 50 per cent of all canneries, Pacific Packing and Navigation Company had 30 per cent of Alaska canneries and no surplus. Alaska Packers Association used its surplus to drive 1903 prices down to 16 cents a dozen. Within three months, PPNC was in receivership.


Another dominant figure in cannery organizations has been the Alaska Salmon Industry, Inc. It was temporarily formed in 1934 to represent the industry in the National Recovery. Administration of the salmon industry in San Francisco. (Further information on NRA investigations will be in following issues.) From this merger came a realization that an organization such as this would be extremely helpful to individual cannery companies. (APA at this time had become a subsidiary of the Del Monte Company based in California.) It was incorporated in 1940, its initial role that of collective bargaining agent for the industry.


Another organization formed by corporate merger was the Association of Pacific Fisheries, formed in 1914. It is responsible for initiating fishery conservation legislation, researching information relevant to fisheries, and disseminating information developed.


The Northwest Branch of the National Canners Association began in 1917 as an offshoot of the National Canners Association (founded in 1907). This organization consists of nearly 100 per cent of all Alaska salmon canneries. Another organization the Salmon Terminal Inc., was formed to handle . . . and storage of packers salmon . . . too, is based in Seattle.

The International District Special District Review Board, which recommends zoning and development regulations for the District, amended its guidelines at a February 9 meeting, allowing two developers of low-income housing to build in the area. The proposed changes will be sent to the City Planning Commission, and the City Council, both of which are expected to approve them by April.


Plans for Century Construction, developers of a housing project on 6th Ave. and Main St., previously did not meet density requirements established by the Board. Security Pacific developers for a project on Maynard Ave. and Weller St., submitted a plan inconsistent with density, yardage, and height regulations.


Low income people have 'no money'


Although the Board had little trouble approving changes in density requirements for Century Construction, there was some opposition to the Pacific Security project.


Tom Quan, Special District Review Board member and major owner of Tai Tung Restaurant, said the security Pacific. Project will not do any good for the District. ""Low income people don't have any money,"" he said.


""We want that space (Security Pacific's lot) for something else,"" Quan added, in reference to the project site which is considered to be within the core of the District.


Higher property taxes?


Earlier, Quan expressed concern about the area's property taxes increasing as a result of the hotel construction. His concern, however, was somewhat diminished when it was learned that the King County Tax Assessment Division unofficially told a group from the District that the Security Pacific project would have little impact on property values.


Quan then suggested that merchants and property owners in the area be asked to respond to Security Pacific's project. However, that was turned down when he was told that the Board had already held a public hearing on the projects and proposed changes in the zoning regulations, but that there were no comments from property owners.


Too high a price?


Tomio Moriguchi, owner of Uwajimaya and also a board member, told the Board Quan's comments were legitimate. Some District businessmen felt Security Pacific paid too high a price for its property, which might cause a leap in property values and make investments in the area too costly.


Moriguchi later made a motion to require the Security Pacific project to have 60 per cent retail-commercial space on its ground floor, if the project elected to build above the 60-foot height limit.


He also commented that Security Pacific go back to HUD and request a different site for the project.


In response, Bill Vivian, Office of Housing Development, explained that ""this would mandate that the entire HUD process be repeated.""


The motion to allow change the guidelines to accommodate the project was made by Fay Hong, owner of the Atlas Cafe. It passed unanimously.


70 at public hearing


Four days earlier, about 70 persons, mostly elderly Chinese residents, attended a public hearing on the issue. The handful of those who spoke were in favor of more low-income housing in the district.


Mrs. Kam Ping Louie, Milwaukee Hotel tenant, told the Special Review Board through a translator that the hotel has not had heating fuel for over three years.


""We want housing in the district,"" she said. ""We don't have no place to go.""


Some place to live


Don Chin, district merchant, told the Board that the ""newer immigrants and the elderly have an affinity for each other, and they especially like to come here (the International District) to live."" He said many elderly came to his store to sign up for housing.


""For sure,"" Chin added, ""they (elderly) don't want to live on the hill (northern part of district) because of their age.""


At the close of the meeting, the Board asked for comments from the property owners. The lone property owner present. Danny Woo, chose not to speak.


However, Mrs. Lee, district resident, told the Board in Chinese. ""We don't have any property. We're just here because we want some place to live.


The Examiner has learned that over 200 persons have signed up with the International. District Housing Alliance for future low-income housing in the District. The Alliance plans to submit those names to the two developers, who have said they will work with them to fill future occupancy.

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) should ""lend its full support to the principle of producing public service announcements in Asian and Pacific Island languages,"" two Asian coordinators of the Public. Service Announcement Project concluded after meeting with community groups throughout the country.


Mariko Yamada, West Coast coordinator, and Robert B. Yoshioka, East Coast coordinator, released a draft of preliminary findings and recommendations on public service announcements (PSA) for Asian and Pacific Island communities late last month.


They met with about 10 members of the Asian community in the international Realty office last month.


The final report to the National Institute of Mental Health will be ready sometime near the middle of this month.


The NIMH should produce a series of PSA's tailored to the specific needs of Asian and Pacific Island communities. Yamada and Yoshioka recommended in their preliminary report.


""We recommend,"" they said, ""that the public service announcements to be produced should not perpetuate or reinforce stereotype perceptions of Asian American and Pacific Island stereotypes.


They suggested the development of regional community media resource groups to articulate community needs and facilitate the production of PSA's.

On October 20, a change in the Immigration and Nationality Act was signed into law. The change is commonly known as the Eilberg Law.


The intent of this amendment, as stated in the official document put out by Rep. Joshua Eilberg, was to ""equalize immigration policy"" between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.


Eilberg states that this amendment ""places top priority on family reunification"" and makes other ""minor modifications.""


Prior to passage of the Eilberg Law, the annual ceiling for immigration from the Eastern Hemisphere was 170,000, with a maximum of 20,000 from each country. However, the ceiling for immigration from the Western Hemisphere was 120,000, with no maximum per country. The Eilberg law imposes the same 20,000 person maximum on individual Western Hemisphere countries.


Thus, an ""equalization"" of the immigration law.


Critics of the Eilberg law point out it is ironic that the United States, a country whose population is mostly immigrant, would impose such strict regulations on immigration.


Although there has been a lot of protest over this change, one must look at the overall picture. In 1976, over 40,000 people immigrated from Mexico to this country. This is over one-third the total number allowed from the entire Western Hemisphere.


On the surface, it's unfair to so severely cut Mexican immigration. But it is much more unjust to allow unlimited Mexican immigration and, by doing so, severely limit the number allowed to immigrate from the rest of the Western Hemisphere.


It is argued that the entire system of immigration needs to be revised, but until it is, allowing a set number from each country seems the best compromise.


The change in the law also purports to reunify families. And the law does make it easier for parents to petition for their dependent children to come to the United States.


But it also states that a child must be at least 21 to petition for his or her parents to come to this country. Dan P. Danilov, a Seattle attorney specializing in immigration law, explained that a person, rightfully a citizen, might have to wait until he or she is 21 to live in this country with parents. This aspect of the law will greatly cut the number of people able to bring parents to this country.


This part of the law is intended for those from another country who have their babies in the United States. Since their baby is a United States citizen, the parents also wish to stay in this country.


Another drastic change involves the change of visa request. In the past, persons could petition for a change of visa here in the United States if they wanted to change their alien status. The new law states that you must go back to your home country and apply for the change of visa there. This could take anywhere from several weeks to one year or longer.


This would discourage students from coming to this country on a visitor's visa, finding employment and then deciding they wanted to stay here.


As one surveys the effects of the Eilberg Law, it becomes apparent that rather than ease immigration and ""equalize"" the law, it serves to restrict immigration and threaten the status of those aliens living here.

Edith Maud Eaton, an Eurasian journalist and writer who lived in Seattle around 1900 and whose articles appeared in major national magazines, has become the focus of intense research. Dr. Sam Solberg, who teaches Asian American literature at the University of Washington, is collecting information on her life and works.


Solberg first became interested in Eaton, who used the pseudonym, Sui Sin Far, through a reference made by Asian American playwright and writer Frank Chin in an article in ""Aiiieeeee, An Anthology of Asian-American Writers."" Not many were aware of her before then.


Eaton published some 23 stories in such popular magazines as Independent, Good Housekeeping, Overland, and New England Magazine. She wrote stories about Chinese workingmen and women, and intermarriage between Chinese and whites.


In 1912, two years before her death at the age of 47, she published ""Mrs. Spring Fragrance,"" a collection of her stories. The book received a favorable review from the New York Times.


Although she wrote about Chinese, Eaton's ethnic identity remains a slight mystery. ""I don't know if she was half Chinese of (half) Japanese,"" Solberg said.


By Eaton's own account, her mother was a Chinese lady educated in England, said Solberg. However, her obituary identified her mother as a Japanese noblewoman, adopted as a child and educated in England.


Solberg also found an entry for Eaton's sister, Mrs. Winnifred Eaton Babcock (Wannata Onoto), in the Women's Who's Who in America, 1914-1915, which stated that she was born in Nagasaki, Japan.


Her father was Edward Eaton, an Englishman with business dealings in the Far East, where Edith Eaton was born.


The interesting thing about Eaton, Solberg said, is that she was the first writer to write from a Chinese American perspective.


""She saw the Chinese community becoming, by generation, an American community,"" Solberg said.


As a Eurasian, Eaton was in a position where she could pass for white. Instead, she chose to be Chinese in identity. Her writings suggest that throughout her life she was trying to discover her roots.


She has a ""real interest in China,"" Solberg said, and once wrote that she read everything she could find about that country.


""She was sensitive about being Eurasian,"" said Solberg, ""was more comfortable within the Chinese American community than oustisde; yet, in the manner of the many lady journalists' of the period, seems to have been perfectly capable of making her own way and maintaining herself as 'a very serious and sober-minded spinster indeed.'


""She may have made an unsuccessful marriage within the Chinese American community, but the inference, based as it is only on oblique references in her own fictions, is highly suppositious.""


For a Chinese American generation more interested in its roots than past generations and other persons with an ethnic heritage, there is a kind of ""psychological kinship"" here, Solberg said.


Reading the writings of Sui Sin Far may help in one's search for an ethnic identity, particularly for those with a mixed heritage.


Eaton lived in Seattle for nearly 10 years. During that time, when she called Seattle her home, she published a number of stories. But the only historical reference to her is in a 1916 listing of Washington authors. This seems incredible to Solberg.


""As a writer for major national magazines,"" he said ""exotic in background and unusual in her association, she would hardly have gone unnoticed in the Seattle of the first decade of this century. Yet, the usual sources yield no mention of her name.


""Why did Seattle ignore her?"" he asks ""Could it be she was too close to Chinatown for comfort?""

Based on the amount of publicity and news coverage, you would think the Seattle School District's voluntary magnet school desegregation plan would have a tremendous impact on the school system.


It probably won't.


The magnet programs, designed by the District's desegregation planning office, are purported to be special programs. usually not found in regular schools. The programs are going to be set up to attract minority students to white-dominated schools and whites to minority-dominated schools. This, hopefully, would improve the racial balance in those schools.


Enrollment guidelines for the magnet programs say 50 per cent of the students will be those who demonstrate that, by transferring, they will improve the racial balance of the school they left and the magnet school they enter. Another 35 per cent will be local catchment area students, within the boundaries of the magnet school. And 15 per cent will be transfers from any school.


The magnet program options the School District will offer next fall include: courses in health sciences, multi-arts, business administration and advance placement.


The School District has set a goal of 3,200 racial transfers by next year. The District hopes to retain the 2,200 who presently participate in the voluntary transfer program and add another 1,000 who would be attracted to magnet schools.


Even if the numerical goal is achieved, the Seattle Public Schools would not be fully desegregated. Schools such as Garfield High, where Black students are a majority, and Beacon Hill Elementary, which is over 50 per cent Asian, will remain minority-dominated or segregated schools.


Desegregation is a numbers game. All the school officials want is to show the Civil Rights Office of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare they are improving the racial balance in the schools.


In essence, this means the District wants to shift an additional 1,000 of the 60,000 plus student population. This amounts to about 10 transfers from each school -- hardly very earthshaking.


Most school transfers next year will probably be Black students, as in the past. This year, there are 19 Asian transfer students and there is no good reason to suspect the magnet school plan will increase this number. Further, it might be noted that none of the bilingual programs will be affected by the magnet plan.

The political forces in Seattle's Chinatown have changed dramatically. Once a Chinese ghetto controlled by its own members, it has been expanded into a larger multi-ethnic neighborhood governed by an elite group of Asian business-persons.


The key turning point for political control over Chinatown came in 1963 when Mayor Dorm Braman announced that the Chinatown sector and the surrounding area would be called the ""International District.""


analysis


A new geographical neighborhood was officially created by the city and, with it, the seeds for a new political order. The engulfment of Chinatown within this new jurisdiction meant that Chong Wa would no longer be the sole governing body for the area.


County stadium issue


The development of the new neighborhood was strengthened with the arrival of the Model Cities Program. That program developed official boundaries for the new neighborhood and established an area-wide organization, both recognized and sanctioned by the city.


Finally, the decision to construct the county stadium adjacent to the neighborhood provided an issue for the community to exploit. A new power structure emerged from the issues centering on this decision.


Significantly, the city developed two legal entities in the area to protect it from the impact of the stadium and to provide, preserve, and enhance its historical character. An equally important factor in the city's formation of these entities, the Special Review Board and public corporation, was its interest in developing a viable commercial area, apparently as a stable tax base.


These two entities are extensions of city government. They are housed in Chinatown along with the local branch of the Department for Community Development, the District Manager's Office With their formation, the city established direct mechanisms to effectively govern the neighborhood.


As part of the city, the International District is of course, under the political jurisdiction of the city. The primary source of political power at this neighborhood level is the power officially deferred or delegated to it by the city. Accordingly, the Special Review Board and public corporation, as legal city government entities delegated powers belonging to the city, are the bases of political power in Chinatown.


District merchants


The representation on these boards provides an important clue about who holds political power in the area.


By and large, district merchants dominate the Special Review Board. Outside businessmen and professionals dominate the public corporation. For the most part, they are appointed by the city or ""elected"" on the basis of their background in business.


The Special Review Board members govern land use in Chinatown. Those on the public corporation have power to own and sell, lend and borrow money, and restore and develop buildings (structures) to preserve and enhance the area.


The actual power these entities have, however, is restricted by the power of the Mayor and City Council. The ultimate power lies with the city which makes final decisions regarding zoning regulations and controls the financial resources needed to make the public corporation effective.


The city also regulates these two boards through its power to make appointments. This process of control is facilitated by the District Manager, the official city representative, ""watchdog,"" and staff person for the Special Review Board. His advice to the Review Board and other community groups and his recommendations to the city play an important role in shaping city policy for the area.


The neighborhood sector which has benefited most from decisions made by the Special Review Board is the merchants, then the property owners and residents.


With regard to the public corporation, it is not so clear. Although its formation was based on receiving funds to develop, the community center, which would ostensibly benefit the residents more than the other two sectors, the Mayor's office wanted the public corporation to promote commercialism. This suggests that the future corporation activities will benefit the business sector the most.


Resident participation


Residents and women have minimal participation on these boards Ironically, the lone International District resident, who, incidentally, was appointed by the Mayor to both boards, is not representative of the area residents. He is a retired university instructor and consultant in international business.


Despite the lack of resident representation on the boards, the residents when organized present a viable political force within the neighborhood.


Not to be overlooked are two community organizations. Inter*im and the International District Economic Association (IDEA). The former is recognized by the city as a broad-based, area-wide agency.


The latter is recognized as representing the business interest in the district. They are however, primarily advocates of change and lack the official sanctions the city has provided the Special Review. Board and public corporation.


Their power is indirect not institutionalized into the formal framework of city government. While they lack direct influence with the Mayor's office they have been successful in lobbying the City Council and working with bureaucrats at City Hall.


The city's creation of the International District and the emergence of the new political power structure has diminished the power Chong Wa once held. At the present time, it has no members on the Special Review Board and its influence on the public corporation is minimal.


Chong Wa provincialism


Through the 1960's, Chong Wa had little influence on the city and was rapidly becoming a dying institution. Its members were provincial in their outlook, focusing on issues they felt directly affected Chinese and not others.


Their concerns centered on maintaining traditional Chinese culture and support for the Taiwan government. A conservative group, its major activities were operation of a Chinese language school, holding cultural activities, and showing movies from Taiwan.


Without the support of the neighborhood and outside professionals, Chong Wa, even with its close ties to the Mayor's office, could not overcome the political forces generated by the city's creation of the International District and the stadium issue.


However, the influence of Chinese is very much present in the neighborhood power structure. Six of the 14 persons who have served on the Special Review. Board and eight of the 12 who have served on the public corporation council have been Chinese. The Chinese far outnumber any of the other groups in terms of ethnic representation. The bulk of these Chinese are not active members of Chong Wa, their participation has been on an individual basis.


Multi-ethnic boards


The Special Review Board and public corporation have always had multiethnic representation. Asians have, by far, the greatest representation. This suggest the neighborhood will become increasingly Asian in character, even though the percentage and number of non-Asians is increasing.


At the same time the power struggle in Chinatown is beginning to be divided less along racial or ethnic lines and more along the lines of social class. The only active ethnic organization in the area whose policy is against the integration of different ethnic groups and whose interest is geared solely towards serving one ethnic group is Chong Wa.


However Chong Wa's influence has declined. But more important the majority of the Chinese who serve on the Special Review Board and the public corporation act and vote according to class interest rather than their ethnicity. The Chinese merchants on the Special Review Board, for instance, typically makes decisions according to his vested interest as a district merchant rather than his interests for Chinese.


The growth of multi-ethnic organizations along class lines (e.g., IDEA and the Housing Alliance) is another indication of the growing differences based on class in Chinatown.

On January 19, Gerald Ford pardoned Iva Toguri before turning over the administration to Jimmy Carter.


Iva Toguri was convicted of treason during World War II because of broadcasting over the radio from Japan to American soldiers. She spent 6 1/2 years in prison and had to pay a fine of $10,000.


She was forced to stay in Japan when war broke out because the Japanese government would not grant her a passport to return to the United States.


Tokyo Rose was the name given all the radio announcers at that time by the American soldiers.


But Iva Toguri became the lone scapegoat. And she had to pay a very heavy price for it.


The Examiner talked to people to get reactions to the pardon.


Cherry Kinoshita, Japanese American Citizens League (IACL) president, said, ""It was not only a victory for Iva Toguri, who so long deserved it, but a just vindication for her innocence.""


Charles Z. Smith, president of the American Baptist Church, had a very strong and influential role in the pardon.


Judge Smith said the pardon, a ""compassionate act"" by President Ford, gave recognition that ""our country has the capacity to recognize its mistakes of the past and to restore, to the extent possible, a measure of human dignity to a person who suffered most during a period of hysteria immediately following World War II, which had overtones of racism and total disregard of basic human rights.""


Min Masuda, an influential member of the JACL, said Japanese Americans are all very, very happy for Iva Toguri. But even though her citizenship was restored, he said, there is one thing pardon did not do.


""Pardon is not the right word because it implies guilt,"" Masuda said.


Sandy Fujita says the pardon was ""the one good thing President Ford did.""


She also believes the media coverage of Iva Toguri was unfair. ""It also makes me sad how much she's aged,"" she said.


Betti Kan says it was a disappointment the pardon took so long, but she added that of course, she was very happy about it. She had other feelings as well.


""It makes people question what the government does, having done illegal things,"" she said.


Kan also called her experiences in trying to get signatures on a petition for the pardon ""the most eye-opening experience.""


""Because the older men were involved in the War and were therefore very patriotic to the government, they didn't want to change their beliefs (and sign the petition),"" she said.


Arlene Oki, who also worked very hard on JACL committee work, said the pardon was long overdue. But she was also glad Toguri stuck with her beliefs.


""She stuck with it and I appreciated it,"" Oki said. ""It is a symbol of things Asians can do if we set our minds to it.


""She spoke out and asserted herself, which showed we all aren't quiet. And that the stereotype doesn't apply to all Asians.

At first glance, the Seattle Keiro Nursing Home looks like an insignificant spot in an easily forgettable neighborhood. Get a little closer, though, and it becomes special indeed.


I arrived there for the first time at 10:30 on a Saturday morning. Already, a crew of volunteer workers was hard at work putting up bulletin boards and lamps for the residents. One group of residents was gathered in front of a color TV. Aides in white buzzed around with residents-on-wheels. Visitors hovered. Firemen inspected corners. The noise level was very close to ""loud,"" what with Dick Clark, the telephone, the visitors, and ""Juice, ojisan?"" ""Obasan, zasshi?"" But the place was alive -- alive and kicking.


The Seattle Keiro Nursing Home officially opened on September 19, 1976. It was the flower of the labor and love of many persons who had struggled, as Issei Concerns, Inc. has, since early 1975, to attain the home as its first goal. It is a 63-bed facility, with 36 beds presently occupied. According to Keiro director, Russ Akiyama, they hope to reach full capacity sometime this year. Along with regular residents, there are those who need only temporary care, say, after a stay in the hospital. Most of these patients return home once recovery is complete.


The nursing home is cheerful and pleasant. It is also apparent that there is a great deal of concern and even affection for the residents. It has been my experience, however, that the statement, ""We're putting Ba-chan (or Ji-chan) in a nursing home,"" has very negative connotations. It may imply an abandonment of not only the elderly themselves but the whole Asian extended-but-close family structure. Any implication of such a breakdown in basics can be rather frightening.


""Unfortunately, some people do need the kind of constant care that really can't be provided at home,"" Akiyama points out. This is true of those who are unable to get around the house by themselves, who may need certain medication, who may not be able to make contact with friends or others by being confined at home.


Akiyama emphasized that Keiro is a nursing home for those who need it. ""There's no one here who doesn't need nursing home care.""


If nursing home care is inevitable for an Issei that you love, the Keiro home makes it pleasantly so. The home is obviously for the Issei. The diet is geared to the Japanese palate. Japanese magazines are there to be thumbed-through or read. The decor features posters of Japan and sumi-e work. Activities and demonstrations may include ondo by the Meijikai, ikebana, kendo, or shigin. Reverends from various Christian and Buddhist churches come each Tuesday to hold services. There's a song session each Wednesday, and there's exercise every day.


""Usually, everyone gets out of bed for their meals, at least,"" says Akiyama. ""It's important that they remain active, and they usually want to get out of bed.""


Perhaps the most important quality of all at Keiro is the communication. Much of the staff is bilingual. Candidates for staff positions are carefully screened, to ensure that the level of concern is consistent throughout. All notices and signs are bilingual. Staff persons who've known Issei residents from other nursing homes say the change in some of them after they arrive at Keiro is incredible.


At other nursing homes they may be completely inactive, uninterested, belligerent, or, sometimes, overly sedated. They arrive at Keiro and people TALK with them. They find out the reason for poor appetites was that there was nothing the Issei particularly cared to eat. They find out the reason the Issei never participated was that the struggle to be understood was too great.


""For example, there is one woman here who really likes TV,"" Akiyama says. ""And she used to fight going to bed at the other nursing home she was at, so the attendants would give her sedatives to get her to rest. After she came here, there was one night that she hesitated going to bed at the regular bedtime. When we talked to her, she explained that she wanted to see the end of the program she was watching. And sure enough, as soon as it was over, she went off to bed. No problem.""


Residents at Keiro take a lively interest in their home. If they aren't direct participants in programs, they're sitting right there, watching and commenting. Meals are communal and dining room territories have been established. Residents may even argue, that is, fight with each other, which is a good, healthy outward sign.


They are able to participate in some of the decisions that govern their lives. They chose Japanese food for New Year's Day and got it. At Thanksgiving, even though many residents would be going home with friends or relatives, most chose to remain at Keiro at least for lunch, and a Thanksgiving meal together.


Keiro operates with a staff of 15 full-time workers (including the director, a director of nursing, an activities director, and a secretary), and 25 to 30 part-time workers. Above and beyond that, there are anywhere from 35 to 40 individuals who regularly visit the home on a volunteer basis. They visit with patients, help clean, help serve, conduct crafts activities wash and set hair, write letters.


Original renovation on the home was done completely by volunteers, with the exception of one difficult painting job. Work parties continue to bring the home into better shape, so it will be able to operate at full capacity. Part of the home still needs work. It is also a primary concern that there be enough staff to give adequate care to whatever number of patients there are.


Private patients pay, other patients offer Medicaid. This takes care of basic salaries and operation costs. Donations, though, provide the bulk of development, expansion monies. Issei Concerns, Inc., is the governing body, its board of directors is responsible for funding and the future.


But contributions to the cause are generous, both in terms of time and Benefits have been given by Bush Garden Restaurant and the Asian Exclusion Act. Donations come from churches, businesses, individuals. Boy Scout troops come and wash hallways and wheel-chairs. Everyone contributes -- everyone wants to contribute.


The Keiro logo is a four-branch bonsai in a tray, designed by Tom Tsutakawa, a symbol of the grace and beauty of age. As Tsutakawa stated in the organization's December, 1976, newsletter, ""A bonsai has to be given tender care, it must be nurtured with utmost skill and patience. Thus, the characteristics of a bonsai are applicable to the elderly people in a nursing home, whose well-being depends on the love and gentle care administered by skilled staff members.""


The working motto of both the home itself and Issei Concerns is ""Keiro cares."" A lot of people care, but don't do anything about it. The people of Keiro and Issei Concerns, and the Japanese American community at large owe a lot to the Issei our pioneers, and they seem to care enough to do as much as they can. The nursing home is a good example of that. Keiro cares, and it works.

The Evacuation. Most people still don't like to talk about it, but more and more people want to know about it. It is the Sansei, my generation, who ask many of those questions. We need to know, though. We need to know because even though we were never there, it has had a tremendous impact on all our lives -- it has been a major factor in making us who we are.


Momoko Iko has written a play about part of that time. That play is Gold Watch, the next production offered by the Asian Exclusion Act.


The play takes place in Wapato, where Iko was born, just prior to and during the implementation of Executive Order 9066 It focuses on the Murakami family and the occurrences in the lives of their small Japanese American farm community.


What would you do?


""I think' the play can help us to understand what our people were going through at the time,"" said director Garrett Hongo, addressing the cast. ""We were never in that situation, but we sometimes say, 'If it was ME, I wouldn't have gone!' For this play, it IS you. You ARE there. Feel the part Feel the time. What would you do?""


What would we do? The people in the play are poor and isolated, disliked foreigners in a new country. They must work hard to survive. They must enjoy as many of life's small pleasures and wonders as they can. Their thoughts are often separated from the thoughts of their children, who were born into a double heritage. One Issei says to his son, ""Do you know why I stayed here? I was freer. I could see what it was like to be a lumberjack, fisherman, and anything else that came my way. Try it out and forget it. Go where I wanted...I guess it is different for you. You were born here and so when other people tell you you don't belong, it must hurt.""


Ambitious undertaking


Gold Watch is the first Japanese American play ever written and produced about the Evacuation. It is the Northwest premiere of a play set in Washington, written by a native of Washington state. It is also the most ambitious undertaking so far by the Asian Exclusion Act. The group plans 16 performances, including a benefit performance for the Seattle Keiro Nursing Home.


""We're always making history,"" says Hongo. ""Everything we do is history.""


The Asian Exclusion Act is one of only three Asian American theater companies in the United States It produced the first West Coast production of Frank Chin's Year of the Dragon. It premiered two plays, And the Soul Shall Dance by Wakako Yamuchi, and Nisei Bar & Grill by Garrett Hongo, both of which will be a part of the upcoming season for Los Angeles' East-West Players.


The cast for this show includes: Lonnie Kaneko as Reverand Sugano; Norm Kaneko and Amy Hill as the merchant, Tanaka, and his wife; Mark Hayashi and Ken Narasaki as Hiroshi Tanaka and Tadao Murakami, and Stephen Sumida and Bea Kiyohara as the farmer, Masu Murakami, and his wife, Kimi.


The price you pay


The people of the play are real. Kimi fires at her complaining son, ""You men control this world! That is the price you pay!"" The Christian farmers, meeting with their minister, still demand, ""What are the Buddhists going to do?""


The dilemma of the people is real. After six months of whispered paranoia, they are given six days to sacrifice their possessions and their fates to a government that never really cared. Masu explodes at the idea:


""Storms, yes, storms cannot be helped ...and weather and seas and stubborn land...that I can understand. To that I can say, shikata ga nai...but men, not men, they don't impress me the same way. How can I stand in awe of men who will die just like me?""


The play runs February 3 to 27, Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. It will be at the Ethnic Cultural Center Theater, 3940 Brooklyn Avenue N.E. For reservations and information call 323-4100 or 622-4719.


We do not go into camp with these people. We do not see them looking back from their future. We are simply there with them. Then. And it is a revelation.

Since the Minorities Search Panel began looking for candidates to fill state governmental posts last year, two Asian Americans have been appointed to sit on governmental bodies.


Neither appointee submitted a resume to the panel, said Asian member Hiro Nishimura during a telephone interview.


Approximately 80 candidates of Asian American ancestry were submitted to the Governor's office, he said. Most of the applications came from the Puget Sound area.


The appointees are Kazuo Watanabe, named to head the Department of Commerce and Economic Development, and Taul Watanabe (no relation), selected to serve a six-year term on the University of Washington Board of Regents.


Kazuo Watanabe is from Seattle, Nishimura said, and until recently lived in the Los Angeles area. Taul Watanabe is a Vice President at Burlington Northern.


In the last round, Asian Americans did not make an impressive showing, Nishimura said. But their resumes are not useless. Second and third level appointments will be made soon, he said.


""I expect to see two or three Asian candidates come through,"" he said. ""Statistics will prove it out.""


Asian applicants who wanted to be appointed had two ways of reaching the attention of the Governor's office, Nishimura said. They could send in a resume to the Minorities Panel, which was relayed to the Governor. Or they could be on a list compiled through the Asian American Affairs Commission headed by Martin ""Mich"" Matsudaira. This list was given to the Governor whose aides could then contact, these candidates for resumes, he said.


Candidates for non-paying positions on boards and commission will also be sought as vacancies arise, he said. Although these positions do not pay money, ""they are important in the sense they are at the decision-making level,"" he said. ""They make policy. From that standpoint, being on a commission or board is a very important thing.""


So far, work on the panel has been ""tremendously"" satisfying for him, he said. In the beginning, he had some difficulties. For a long time no deadlines were set by the Governor's office.


The panel was unsure of the last day they could submit resumes for consideration. ""One day could make the difference,"" Nishimura said.


As a result, Nishimura delivered three batches of resumes to Olympia. On other occasions, he took them to the homes of the Governor's aides in Seattle, rather than depending on the postal service.


Nishimura looked ahead to the next rounds of state governmental appointments. He said the work of the panel is an ""ongoing pursuit. Our job is not over yet.""

Need help with emotional problems?


Or maybe you're finding it difficult to adjust to a new environment.


The Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), at 655 South Jackson, is ready to help with these problems and more. ACRS is a multilingual, multicultural agency geared to assist all Asians to obtain needed services in physical and mental health, education and welfare.


In its fifth year, ACRS is staffed by over 60 volunteers, supported by paid staff members. A 15-member board of directors governs the agency. The board has Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese members. Dave Okimo-to is executive director. Recently added to the ACRs staff were: a full-time statistician, a drug outreach worker from the Center for Addiction Services, two Vietnamese counselors and a Cambodian counselor.


The three counselors are especially helpful because of problems encountered by Vietnamese refugees.


""They have typical problems since they don't understand English,"" said Stephanie Eng, ACRS administrative assistant. ""They need help in learning the language.""


Special problems exist because the refugees experienced long years of war. Additionally, prior to the arrival of the refugees, there were few Vietnamese refugees in the Seattle area.


Other ACRS services include: short and long term counseling, referral to existing human-care services inside and outside the community and crisis intervention. Support services include: providing transportation and interpreting instructions and regulations.


ACRS also does follow-up work assessing whether available help was utilized and, if not, why?


""We have no programs, as such,"" said Eng. ""We mainly deal with mental health counseling on an advocacy basis.""


Most Asians and Asian Americans are hesitant to approach agencies for help, but, ""the intake has gone up,"" said Eng. Typical problems include: depression, Joneliness, difficulties with strange customs and language, unemployment, marital and family stress, truancy, delinquency, drug abuse and alcoholism.


The bulk of the counseling occurs in the ACRS office. But, said Eng, ""We hope eventually to be able to do some outreach work in the community.""


ACRS works with other community agencies to help deal more responsibly with Asian clients. ACRS also serves as a consultant, helping agencies develop programs affecting the local Asian communities. A United Way organization, ACRS also receives funding from the Church World Service, King County Mental Health Board, Washington State Office of Emergency Services, Washington State Department of Employment Security and King County CETA.


Two bright orange signs are visible through the windows of the ACRS office. It's open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Mondays through Fridays and evenings by appointment. The phone number is 623-6756.

It's been a year since the opening of the Kingdome. Has the International District been adversely affected as was predicted?


The best way to answer this is to survey what has taken place since the Kingdome was imposed upon the I.D.


One new restaurant has opened and several others have been remodeled to cater to the tourist trade, not to the residents of the District or the Asian community which has traditionally patronized the District.


There is money spent in the I.D., but on business interests, not to serve the needs of the residents. In fact, the trend has been to discourage residency within the District.


The stadium management recently announced that, unlike similar stadiums in other cities, the Kingdome turned a profit.


For whom was this profit made? Does this mean the Kingdome is self-supporting and the taxpayers of King County no longer have this added financial burden?


To answer these questions, one must understand how the stadium was funded King County sold blocks of bonds to banks. In effect, the county took out loans to pay for the building of the stadium.


Upon close investigation of the terms of this transaction, one sees that, for one block of bonds sold to the bank for $5,000,000, the taxpayers of King County will end up paying over $12,000,000 back.


It's interesting, also, to note who makes the profit from the County's taxpayers.


Harris Trust & Savings & Associates (including Seattle Trust & Savings) entered into a joint venture with Chase Manhattan Bank to buy the bonds from the County. They, in turn, sold them as tax exempt municipal bonds in blocks of $10,000 or more.


Obviously, the average person cannot afford this kind of tax shelter. This is one way the wealthy avoid paying taxes and make more money, too. They are paid interest on these tax exempt bonds. The county pays the interest on these bonds through a bank. In this case, the banks are Rainier and Chemical Bank of New York.


Also, since the events in the stadium are put on by private interests, most of the profit, except for a tax on admission, goes to these private interests, not to the people who paid twice as much as originally planned to build it, with interest.


It should be noted that the domed stadium was originally scheduled to be built near the Seattle Center, but the residents of the Lower Queen Anne area protested, so it was moved to the other end of the downtown area where the vigorous protests of the I.D. residents were ignored.


What does this mean to the International District?


It's easy to see that, unless something is done to prevent it, the I.D. will become an Asian version of Pioneer Square, where rather than deal with the problems of the residents, most of them will be thrown out so profitable businesses can be built with no consideration for residents wishes or provisions made for alternative housing.


This attitude by the government and businesses is summed up well in a line taken from a skit presented during the International District Youth Council Street Festival in 1974, ""Let's get these old bums out of here, they bother the tourists.""


If there are still those who feel the King County government is concerned for the needs of the I.D. residents, they should have seen a picture hanging on a wall in the office of John Spellman, King County Executive. It was a sketch of the Kingdome, looking at it from the east. It showed a section of 1-5 which is presently unfinished, finished, with an exit ramp leading directly to the Kingdome, right through the middle of the International District.


An angry demonstrator pulled the picture down and tore it up.

An International District co-op has quietly donated money to district projects.


Cicada, an arts and crafts co-op, established to encourage young artists and provide an outlet for their works, has contributed nearly one thousand dollars to five projects since last fall.


The International District Emergency Center, an emergency first aid project headed by Donnie Chin, received $400. The recently-completed mural project, painted on the rear side of the Bush Hotel overlooking Hing Hay Park, received $100.


Cicada donated $260 to the community garden project. The International District Housing Alliance was given $50 for translation, printing and mailing.


The Residents' Pottery Class, which will be taught this summer by Poddy McNeely, Cicada member, also received money from Cicada.


One of Cicada's primary goals is to contribute to social and cultural programs in the district, said Diana Bowers, co-treasurer of the Co-op along with Jean Funai. That was agreed upon when they started the Co-op, she said.


For each item the Co-op sells, Bowers explained, 80 per cent goes to the artist and 20 per cent to the operating budget. Co-op members also pay $5 monthly in dues and a $20 membership fee which goes into the operating budget.


Members collectively decide which projects will receive money. Suggestions have come from individual members and community groups.


The overhead cost for the non-profit Co-op is kept to a minimum. Members take turns managing the store and taking on chores such as helping with publicity, cleaning and bookkeeping -- all without pay.


The Co-op expects to make donations every quarter. But how much they will donate depends on the amount of money it makes from the goods sold, said Pam Niimi, Co-op member.


Cicada, which only began about a year ago, is located at 623 S. Jackson St.

""The essence of life is in trying to improve, and any man can do that.""


This optimism is personified in the life and embodied in the fiction of N.V.M. Gonzalez. At 62, he is an epitome of youthful idealism and mature realism. He is gray-haired, with fine wrinkles etched on his face. But he is neither an old cranky professor nor an absent-minded ivory tower artist-recluse. He is a sociable person, constantly cheerful, amiable, and accommodating. A responsive conversationalist, he talks to colleagues and students in the University of Washington HUB, on the road, or in his office with a characteristic smile and chuckle. He speaks with a slight accent, punctuating words with several nods or an occasional swing of an arm. The topic is always the same: his country and people.


The country he talks about is the Philippines, where he was born in 1915. One of five children, he is the son of a schoolteacher who turned to farming and the meat business during the depression of the 1930's. N.V.M. Gonzalez finished high school, but due to the Depression and World War II, he only briefly studied law and then went to writing. When he was 18, he learned to type in the only place in his province where there was a typewriter -- the municipal clerk's office in Calapan, Mindoro, an eight-hour hike from his home.


In his early twenties he moved to Manila and joined the Graphic, one of the leading magazines in the Philippines before and after the war. He worked there for 12 years, first as a messenger, then as a proofreader, and later, as a wrtier.


Gonzalez says the turning point in his life came when he discovered Robert Louis Stevenson. One of Stevenson's tales, ""Sire D'Maleroit,"" tells the dramatic story of a young man who found his way into a strange house in Paris. An old man, standing at the door, said to him: ""I have been waiting for you.""


""That was during the Depression,"" said Gonzalez. ""I was young and there was nothing to do so I began to write."" His first published work was a short story in the Graphic. This was followed by a group of poems in Chicago's Poetry Magazine.


That was almost 40 years ago. Today his published works include: A Season of Grace, Children of the Ash-covered Loam and Other Stories, Look Stranger, On this Island Now, The Winds of April, and Selected Stories. His essays and short stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies. In addition, he has been critiqued by several Filipino writers and students who know him simply as ""N.V.M."" The English poet James Kirkup and the American writer, Lucien Styrk have reviewed his fiction. They rank Gonzalez with Chekhov, Ivan Bunin, Turgenev, and have compared his stories with those of James Joyce and Eudora Welty.


Gonzalez won awards and prizes from the Philippine government, fellowship grants from the British Council and the West German Federal Republic. He has attended writing workshops with writers Katherine Anne Porter, Wallace Stegner, and Mark Shorer.


From 1950 to 1970, N.V.M. Gonzalez was a professor at the University of the Philippines and was a lecturer in several other universities, including the University of Hong Kong. Since his arrival in the United States in 1970, he has taught at the University of Denver, the University of California at Santa Barbara and Berkeley, and California State College at Hayward Currently, he is a visiting professor at the University of Washington.


After all this, it would be understandable if N.V.M. Gonzalez were a little tired. But he isn't. He is still writing.


""I've many more stories to write,"" he said. ""You should look at my notes."" He keeps a schedule of writing projects: a fictional trilogy, eagerly awaited by Philippine and other Asian writers and critics; a book of essays on the problem of Third World literature; and many more short stories and poems.


The people he writes about are the Filipinos. He said he has set out to ""provide the Filipino with an image that will enhance his identity. I think he knows his identity. It's more a question of maintaining it.""


He writes of the young and the old, the simple and the sophisticated, the city and the country, faithfully depicting the eternal struggle of man to improve his lot. He writes of a young man's folly and ignorance and jolts him to self-realization, which is the road to his salvation. He writes movingly of a peasant who struggles to survive in a cruel world infested with loan sharks and political leeches. The peasant lives in a world of perennial droughts and rains, rats and debts, but he is always looking forward, despite everything, to that inevitable yearly 'season' of grace -- harvest time.


Gonzalez reaches down to the lowest level of his characters' miserable existence, and, in depicting them, gives them universal stature and, perhaps, a safe niche in world literature. After reading and studying his novels and short stories, one must agree with American writer and critic Lucien Styrk, who, writing about Gonzalez's Selected Stories, said, ""the idea of nationality becomes rather vulgar; disenchantment, like hope, belongs to no one people. It is a sensation known from Dublin to Manila...Mr. Gonzalez is most telling when he writes of the deprived, and he finds people to care about all over those 7,000 islands of his. He is a very pure writer.""


N.V.M. Gonzalez sees writing fiction as a vehicle for truth: ""It is only in fiction, works of the imagination, where it is possible to study what the truth is like.""

Two women of the renowned Tang family of artists will bring their art from Hong Kong to the Wing Luke Museum for a four-day exhibition, March 8 to 11.


Lai-si and Lai-shan Tang will present choice selections of their family's original art. There will be an opportunity to view contemporary works being created in the East, and also an opportunity to discuss the works with two of the artists.


The viewer will see Lai-si's oil painted abstract landscapes and the romantic surrealism of Lai-shan's pen and ink lithographs.


The paintings of their brothers, Chihang and Lik-hang, will also be on display. Chi-hang, a graduate of London's Royal Drawing Society, is well-known to art lovers throughout the United States, Canada and Europe, where he has held many one-man shows. He cleverly blends translucent oils and Western materials to create the traditional delicate Chinese style. There is an almost illusive water-color effect.


In Hong Kong, the Tangs have their own gattery. Art selection, there, becomes an educational pleasure as the individual artist explains the Chinese intricacies expressed in each creation.


The public is invited to attend a party to honor the Tangs, March 8, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Museum.


The Wing Luke Museum is located at 414 8th Ave. S. It's open Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is free.

The new coordinator of Minority Student Affairs at Shoreline Community College says a degree from a four-year institution is ""not always the way to get into the field that you want.""


Patricia Diangson, at Filipino originally from Chicago, said the enrollment at Shoreline is down, at least in part, because the University of Washington's Equal Opportunity Program is luring minorities away. She said, however, that there is a trend toward community colleges because students are finding that attendance at a four-year university does not ensure employment after graduation.


Diangson has been a caseworker and supervisor for the Cook County Department of Public Assistance in Black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods. She has worked with the Winnebago Indian community in Wisconsin.


Diangson also worked on a National Institute of Mental Health project at Mclvaigh Junior High in Tacoma. The project attempted to prevent student alienation and delinquency. She worked in consultation with the school's multicultural program.


In 1974, she worked with the Neighborhood Youth Corp, out of the Asian Counseling and Referral Service.


Diangson is affiliated with the Asian American Alliance in Tacoma, serving as treasurer in 1975 and president in 1976.


Diangson said Shoreline has a good financial aid program for minorities. As part of her job, she will inform the Asian community of career possibilities and available services.

It goes on the air every Thursday night, 7 to 7:30 p.m. on KRAB, 107.7 FM. The program includes news items read in Cantonese and about 20 minutes of popular music from Hong Kong.


There is a large Chinese population in Seattle, especially here in the International District, which is not very fluent with the English language. Many of these people do not have ready access to Chinese newspapers while others have problems even reading Chinese. This means they have difficulty finding out what is happening in the world, or even here in the City.


Cantonese Time provides an alternative. By listening to the program, they can hear a consolidated report of the weekly news.


Cantonese Time is entertainment-oriented: the majority of the program consists of popular Chinese music. For those who have been in this country a long time, the program keeps them in touch with the ""old world,"" and for more recent immigrants (especially the younger audience), they can listen to some familiar music and maybe relieve some of their homesickness.


The whole program, except for the news, is done in both English and Cantonese. This gives those who do not understand Cantonese a chance to follow the program. Also, this format helps break some cultural barriers, letting non-Chinese-speaking people listen to contemporary Chinese music, and providing an idea of what it is like in Hong Kong.


The idea of Seattle Chinese Broadcast began last October, when negotiations were first started with KRAB to obtain a time slot. KRAB is entirely listener supported, non-commercial, and does not receive any funding from educational institutes. It has, for 14 years remained committed to the concept of airing what cannot be heard elsewhere. KRAB's aim is to do something worthwhile and valuable and different to produce programs nobody else would produce. Now special interest groups are being served. This is where Cantonese Time comes in It is one of a kind here in Seattle.


Seattle Chinese Broadcast is a non-profit registered student organization of the University of Washington. Its members, all bi-lingual, are both students and working people from the community.


The organization conducts a meeting every Monday night to decide what should be included in the news items to be broadcast the following. Thursday. Two members are then made responsible for writing up the news script for the show. All the information on the music to be played is gathered by a music subgroup which is responsible for the music script. Other duties involve, of course, the actual broadcast. Usually, two people will talk on the show and one person will work on the engineering board. A coordinator is chosen at the beginning of each academic quarter to see to the smooth operation of the broadcast. All the duties are rotated among the volunteers so everyone can become familiarized with each spectra of the operation.


Seattle Chinese Broadcast is a new organization and most of its members don't have any experience in radio broadcast or script-writing. They have however, integrity and enthusiasm; and they plan to put out a good show for the local community. Any constructive suggestions or criticisms to improve the quality of Cantonese. Time are most welcomed. Any interested volunteers are encouraged to participate. Seattle Chinese Broadcast can be contacted by calling KRAB during the program. Thursday night between 7 and 7:30 p.m., at 325-5110, or by writing to:

Asians are slow to get on the air in television news because they are stereotyped as quiet and shy, said Sharon Maeda, producer-director at KCTS/Channel 9. And Asians have also bought into that stereotype themselves, she says.


Maeda, who has been with Channel 9, a public broadcasting station, for almost two years, was recently named to a Corporation for Public Broadcasting task force which will look into the status of minorities in public broadcasting. Before becoming producer-director, she was the station's community involvement director.


""You walk into a television station and you'll see Asians as graphic artists, engineers and as secretaries,"" said Maeda. ""These are all jobs that don't have to do with acting or being on the air.""


Public television was created as an alternative to commercial stations, Maeda says, but it's just beginning to do that. ""Public television has not done the job it could do in the area of Third World people,"" she said. ""The hiring statistics show that public broadcasting is just as bad as commercial stations in terms of hiring practices. Unless you have Third World people in stations across the country, the program content is not going to show that kind of input.""


Asians entering the television media face a traditional bias. As a result of this bias, Maeda said, there are more Asian women on the air than Asian men.


""The stereotype of women as Suzie Wong types and sweet sex objects have been perpetuated throughout the media,"" said Maeda. ""On the other hand, the stereotype of men is the ninety-pound weakling with buck teeth and glasses. I think that has a lot to do with how we get our feet into the door.""


""There are several good Asian men who are on radio and at other levels of television,"" she said, ""but very few are in front of the camera. That kind of reverse sexism has something to do with it.""


Maeda said accents create barriers for Asians and other Third World people attempting to break into the media. But she pointed out that certain people like Henry Kissinger are accepted despite their accents.


""When you're in a position of power, you have a heavy accent and people can't understand you, it doesn't really matter, because you're big and powerful,"" Maeda said. ""Now if you're in a disadvantaged position, like most Third World people are in this country, all of a sudden your accent becomes an overwhelming factor. People cannot understand you, so you can't become a reporter, a teacher or any other field where you have to talk a lot. I really think it's tied very closely to racism on the part of society.""


Ideas and concepts in the media have an impact over so many people, especially children, that it's important for minority people in the media to always be aware of who they are, wherever they are, said Maeda.


""My allegiance is supposed to be number one to Channel 9, but I have a difficult time with that sometimes,"" she said. ""You're always in a position where...you're trying to propose alternative kinds of ideas and concepts that you feel more adequately represent your community.


""You're always walking this tightrope between your job and the thing you believe to be important in your own community. It's a hard thing to cope with. It's a lot of pressure, it's a lot of frustration, but it's something that I feel has to be done.""


Maeda's first program as producer-director was, ""Save The City,"" a documentary on redlining in Seattle, shown on Channel 9 in April. ""I will always pay attention to make sure that Third World issues are covered in a subject no matter what it is,"" she said. ""We often get into a trap of always producing shows where the whole Third World community is watching, but they're the only ones. We have to get that information over to the larger community.""


Asian and other minority communities must pressure local stations to improve minority representation,"" Maeda said. ""The overall community is affected by the media, especially the children,"" she said. ""It we're ever going to change people's attitudes and their racist tendencies, then we've got to be there in the media where it's impacting on everybody all the time. But until we change their attitudes, we have to constantly be on their backs.""

A minority law school admissions conference was held February 12 and 13 at the University of Washington law school. About 65 to 80 persons, representing all Pacific Northwest law schools, attended.


Speakers included: Rod Kawakami, the Coalition for Justice in the Legal System, Paul Wada, the Third World Coalition for Justice in the Legal System (San Francisco); and Bob Yamigiwa, the Asian Legal Association.


The conference was aimed at increasing minority law students and lawyers.


Elmira Hunter Conley, a black private attorney, encouraged minorities to get into private practice. She said this allows minorities to serve a more useful function for the community and with greater impact.


Yamigiwa said he likes to think of himself as ""a community lawyer, the type of person who could be a resource to the community.""


""In other words,"" he said, ""someone can call me up on the phone and I can answer it without the person having to worry about being charged for a $30 to $40 phone call.""


""If you're good to the community, the community will be good to you."" Yamigiwa said the community will refer clients to those thought of as community attorneys.


Speakers touched on recent developments affecting minority law students, such as the Bakke court decision in California, which stated that a medical school special admissions policy for minorities was unfair to whites.

The preference system is the first barrier one encounters when applying to immigrate to the United States.


Before a visa can be granted, the Immigration and Naturalization Service determines the ""preference"" a person belongs to.


There are eight preference categories.


(1) unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens


(2) spouses and unmarried sons and daughters of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence


(3) members of the professions or persons of exceptional ability in the sciences and arts


(4) married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens


(5) brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens 21 years of age or over


(6) skilled and unskilled workers in short supply


(7) refugees


(Nonpreference) other immigrants


The system is supposedly designed to allow unification of families. Spouses of U.S. citizens are admitted without having to be in a preference category. The first and second preferences give priority to unmarried children and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents.


However, the third through the sixth preferences seem inconsistent with the government's contention it is ""bringing families together."" Professionals are the third preference, coming before married children of citizens. Apparently, the government is giving priority to ""professionals and people with exceptional ability,"" believing they can benefit U.S. society.


Giving these people ""preference"" does not assure them employment in their field of expertise. Filipino doctors and lawyers arrive in this country only to find their credentials are not accepted, even though the Philippine educational system was set up by Americans and modeled after American schools.


To practice medicine or law, they must pass extremely difficult tests and, invariably, must return to school to do so. Since this is not economically feasible for most immigrants, the vast majority of Filipino lawyers and doctors are working as clericals or medical technicians or in jobs totally unrelated to their chosen profession.


Why give someone preference and then not allow them to work in their area of expertise?


With this in mind, why are ""skilled and unskilled workers in short supply"" put at much lower preference, fifth. Although the profession of watchmaker, electrician, or garbage collector may not be as ""prestigious"" as doctor, people for those jobs are certainly as necessary.


Also, why the stipulation ""in short supply."" The United States has a history of admitting large numbers of unskilled workers when they were needed, then disregarding them when they were no longer needed. Examples are the Chinese railroad workers, Japanese and Filipino cannery workers, and Mexican agricultural workers.


The seventh preference or refugee category is ambiguous. Although these people supposedly have a much lower preference, the U.S. Has admitted some refugees with total disregard for those already wanting for admittance.


The Vietnamese are a good example of this. Attorney, Dan P. Danilov, immigration specialist, explained that the Vietnamese refugees were illegally admitted after the fall of Saigon in 1975. But the U.S. government quickly passed legislation to make it legal.


He also pointed to a similar situation when hundreds of Cubans were admitted with total disregard for existing procedures.


""Recently a U.S. federal court in Chicago ruled against the U.S. in this case,"" he said. ""The court banned any action to deport any aliens from the Western hemisphere with priority dates between 7/1/68 and 12/31/76 because of the illegal admittance of Cubans before those with previous applications.""


The last category is nonpreference. Danilov explained that, under this preference, anyone with $15,000 and a U.S. business in which to invest can pay his money and immigrate to this country.


""In effect,"" says Danilov, ""he can buy his way into the U.S.""

On April 11, the City Council passed an ordinance calling for the purchase, renovation, and development of a community center at the Bush Hotel, 621 South Jackson Street.


The center will be built by the Public Corporation and the city, and operated by the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority. The center has been a long time in coming. Almost four years have passed since the need for a cultural and community center was pointed out.


The ordinance called for appropriation of $200,000 for acquisition and construction of the center, and set aside an additional $350,000 in third year Block Grant monies.


According to James Mason, District Manager, the ordinance was based on a feasibility study prepared by Management Consulting Services/The Planning Group of Seattle, and drawn up by the city's corporation counsel.


The ordinance was submitted to the Council together with a letter which raised several questions about the feasibility study.


According to the counsel opinion, merely purchasing the hotel for a community center would not be enough to warrant the use of public monies under state law.


""If the upper floors are not acquired for public use, it is doubtful that the establishment of a community center would authorize purchase of the entire hotel,"" the counsel said.


Government agencies have no power to acquire land regardless of means, unless the proposed acquisition is for a ""public use,"" the counsel said.


Conversion of the upper floors into low income housing units would qualify as a ""public use"" and support purchase of the entire hotel, the counsel said.


Although the feasibility study indicated a plan or intention to provide such housing, the counsel felt the wording should be stronger, in the form of a ""binding legal agreement.""


The counsel also said private community service agencies renting office space in the building could not be subsidized. Sections in the study were ""worded"" to suggest rents paid by these agencies would be lower than the amount needed to offset operational and maintenance costs, Mason said. The study also suggested that rents to other tenants would be higher to make up the difference paid by the agencies.


According to Mason the counsel was saying, ""You can't allow a group to come in (Bush Hotel) and pay less than the market rent.""


If the rents charged to the agencies were higher than for office space of a similar type elsewhere, the counsel suggested the difference would be made up by the performance of an ""in-kind"" service to the community, Mason said.


An ""in-kind"" service would be one ordinarily done for pay, he said.


Construction is expected to begin no sooner than October or November of this year, he said.

Ever since she was a child, Tamako Niwa has gone her own way. This way has led in the direction of Japan.


Her interest has led her to Radcliffe, Harvard, the International House in Japan, the American Embassy, and finally to the University of Washington.


""Ever since I was a little girl, (relations) have been very bad between Japan and America,"" she said. ""Ever since I could read the paper, I've been interested in promoting friendship and real understanding"" between the two nations.


This ""understanding"" is not the superficial kind, Niwa said. It's not just ""I love Japanese food,"" or Japanese gardens are great."" It's a real understanding of how a Japanese thinks and communicates, she said.


Tamako Niwa is an Associate Professor of Asian Languages and Literature at the University. She has written several Japanese language textbooks, raises funds for a high school exchange program, and teaches. She is the first woman director of the local Japan America Society.


Young people of Japanese ancestry are of particular concern to her. She doesn't think they are working hard enough to help build understanding between Japan and the United States. She said Sansei students in her classes ""are satisfied too soon.""


Sansei have an ""in"" to another country, she continued. ""They have relatives. They have an advantage. It's fine to talk with Issei grandparents. But think about the future.""


She said ""Caucasians have contributed more to understanding than Sansei.""


Niwa was born in Berkeley, California in 1922. Her father passed away when she was young. After graduation from high school in 1941, she entered the University of California. She spent a little over one quarter at the school before war broke out.


Niwa and her mother were fortunate. They never lived in a concentration camp. They had friends who helped them move to Idaho. Less than one year later, Niwa was accepted at Radcliffe.


Only one other person of Japanese ancestry attended Radcliffe while she was there. Even so, she did not feel different. There were some 100 to 300 Chinese students attending the school, she recalls, and it was difficult for Caucasians to tell which was which.


Her experiences at Radcliffe were positive, she said.


However, a serious incident occurred shortly after she arrived. ""The fiance of a friend of mine was working on the atomic bomb, although I didn't know it at the time,"" she said. ""The War Department discovered I was there, and decided I had to be investigated, and suspended from school.""


She said one of her professors, a white. Russian named Elisseeff ""thought it was absurd. He went to the provost of Harvard."" The provost agreed with Elisseeff, and told the War Department that ""he would take responsibility for me,"" she said.


As a result, Niwa was not suspended, and she felt ""very good"" about the whole affair.


Some Quaker friends, used her as a ""guinea pig"" about the time Japanese were beginning to be relocated outside the camps. They took her to parties and groups to see if she would be accepted she said. If she was other Japanese might be placed there, she said.


The only people she felt resented her were Chinese students, some of whom later became her ""closest friends.""


Getting to know people is important,"" she said. ""I can't stress this enough.""


After graduation from Radcliffe, she worked at Harvard, and the International House in Japan. In Japan, she received two job offers, one from Time Life magazines, and the other from the American Embassy there. She chose the Embassy.


Niwa became assistant director for the Area and Language program at the Embassy. The program trained career foreign officers. She took the students to plant rice in farming villages, to copper mines, to fishing villages, and other places in Japan to learn and better understand the people and culture.


Later she began work on a Japanese language text with a former professor from Radcliffe Midway through the first draft, the professor was made Ambassador to Japan, she said.


About this time, she passed through Seattle. The University of Washington was interested in starting an intensive program of teaching foreign languages, she said. Because of her experiences with a similar program in the Foreign Service, she was asked to come and set it up.


Niwa said she named some conditions, and the University met them. So she came to Seattle.


She has accomplished a great deal in her life to help bridge the gap between Japan and America.


But in the process, she has found herself between another gap.


""I'm not a complete Japanese."" she said. ""I'm not a complete American. I'm somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.""

The two new low-income housing projects to be built in the International District will be restricted to 35 per cent minority occupancy, according to Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations.


These regulations also apply to the International Terrace which currently has a minority occupancy rate of 80 per cent. According to a HUD compliance director, this is considered segregated housing and must be changed.


Bob Santos, director of Inter*im, said, ""The 80 per cent minority occupancy of the International Terrace is merely a reflection of the overall population of the International District.""


""Segregation is segregation,"" says the compliance director, a Mr. Howlet, ""and the situation not only at the International Terrace, but all other HUD-subsidized housing must be brought into compliance with federal regulations. This is the law.""


This doesn't mean any current minority residents of the International Terrace will have to move. What it does mean is that when a vacancy occurs, whites will have first opportunity for occupancy.


Theresa Murphy, of Seattle Housing Authority (SHA), explains that SHA is compelled to enforce the HUD regulations tions or lose its federal monies. ""Each resident was informed of other available housing,"" she said, ""and was offered to exchange present housing for housing in a project with a white majority."" In addition to this, she said, ""when a unit is vacated, SHA must actively search for a white resident."" If SHA cannot find someone on the white waiting list willing to move in, it must wait at least 30 days before allowing someone from the minority waiting list to move in.


""So far there has been no shortage of whites,"" says Elame Ko of Inter*im.


She went on to say that the new housing won't be available until January, 1979, at the earliest. ""There are many Asian elderly waiting to get in, and never will,"" she said, referring to the barrier of the HUD regulations.


Even officials at SHA said they agree with Inter*im about the absurdity of this situation. Why build low-income housing in the International District, it is asked, and then allow only a small percentage of the residents to move in? But, according to regulations as explained by Howlet, this is the way it must be.


""HUD has the responsibility to not only provide decent low-income housing, but to see that it is not segregated,"" Howlet said. And according to federal ruling, he says, anything over 35 per cent minority is segregation.


""The International Terrace should never have been built in the International District,"" he said. He said that, to achieve integrated housing, people should move to other areas. Asked if the government was going too far in dictating where people can and cannot live, Howlet replied, ""This is the law and therefore it must be upheld.""


So what's the solution?


Howlet said people should adhere to the law as it is or ""write to your congressman.""


Bob Santos said, ""We can ask for a different definition of what a minority is as it applies to a given community.


""It's not right that people living in substandard housing have to wait until the white waiting list runs out.


""We've been fighting for seven years for decent, low-income housing for the residents of the International District. Now that we're finally getting it built, HUD says they can't move in."" Santos says they fought to get the housing and they'll fight to keep it.

The Pacific West coast salmon canning industry began with entrepreneur William Humes. He had previously been a salmon fisherman on the Kennebec River, Maine. Industrialization left the river polluted, resulting in depletion of the fisheries. In 1852, Humes moved to California to find a suitable salmon-bearing river. He found his salmon. And it was a commercially abundant source: the Sacramento River.


In 1856, he was joined by his brothers, George and John. Later, in the spring of 1864, a boyhood friend of George Hume, Andrew Hapsgood was enticed to bring his canning equipment to California. Together, they established the Hapsgood and Humes Company. It set up operation in an old scow, becoming the first salmon cannery on the West Coast. It was located at the foot of K Street in Sacramento, California.


Their first year brought 2000 cases of 48 one pound cans. The cans painted a ""fiery red"" to denote Red Salmon. They lost half to spoilage, but the remaining half was sold to an Australian market at a profit. This enabled them to pay off past debts and prepare for the season of 1865.


Hydraulic mining had been introduced to California in 1865. The sludge and sediment stirred up by the hydraulic mining method prevented salmon from spawning productively. This factor caused the Hapsgood and Humes Company to move north.


They moved as far north as the Columbia River. In 1866, at Eagle Cliff, Washington, approximately 40 miles from Astoria, the first Columbia River cannery began operation. The following year Hapsgood and Humes Company dissolved. Each of the Humes brothers and Andrew Hapsgood starting individual companies.


Post Civil War industrialization


During Post Civil War industrialization others became interested in duplicating the success of the Hapsgood and Humes. Company canneries in California and on the Columbia River. By 1881, Columbia River canneries were producing 630,000 cases.


People moving west crowded into the Columbia River towns of Oregon and Washington. Competition between cannery operations increased, and cannery owners began looking for new fishing grounds. In 1877, the first Puget Sound cannery was started at Mulkiteo by a Jackson and Myers Company.


The northward trek of canneries continued. The North Pacific Trading and Packing Company began a cannery at Klawock, Alaska. In that same year, Cutting Packing Company started a cannery at Old Sitka. In 1882, the last major salmon producing area opened. Bristol Bay.


In creating this industry, many problems had to be overcome. First, markets had to be created. Originally, only local areas bought salmon products. With the development of canned salmon came the creation of an Australian market in 1864, a South American market in 1865, and the Great Britain market in 1871, the most important one.


An important factor in marketing of canned salmon has been the influence of wars. From the very beginning of the canning industry, was has helped to create a market for canned products. Napoleon preserved food that could be easily transported by armed forces. With Nicholas Appert creator of canned, goods came the beginning of all the canning industries.


The Civil War led to a sixfold increase in all camping production a nearly inexhaustible market was created. The added technical advances during this period helped immensely to create a permanent place for the canning industry. The first major war to directly affect the salmon canning industry was the Spanish-American War, which created another important market for canned salmon. World Wars I and II both played an equally important role in creating stability in the salmon markets. At times during World War II, 90 per cent of all salmon cannery products were directed to the armies of the Axis.


Labor Forces


A lack of cheap labor has always plagued new industries. Salmon canning was no different. Whites who originally did the back-breaking work of hand butchering, hand cleaning, hand filling and hand casing of salmon refused to work for low wages. George Humes solved this dilemna in 1872 by his introduction of Chinese ""coolie"" laborers. Soon, contracted Chinese laborers began taking over the menial jobs. (Further discussion of labor forces will be taken up, in future issues.)


Mechanization


They worked for starvation wages and deprived white men and women of jobs, although only the hungry folks would do the fish cleaning very long Sometimes the white population did something about it, rioting against the yellow race running them out of town temporarily.""


This quote from ""Fish and Ships"" described the problem arising from use of Chinese to solve the labor shortage problem. A new solution had to be found.


The industry began a drive for mechanization; first with various improvements in can making in the 1870's, then with development of filling machines in the 1890's. The menial task of hand butchering was still performed by Chinese laborers. A ""clatter of China talk, a flash of long knifes, the smell of salt and cooked fish was still very much a part of cannery life,"" according to ""Fish and Ships"".


It was not until 1904 that a machine was developed to take the task of the Chinese. A machine was created by a Canadian which would, in the words of the inventor, do away with Chinamen by doing the fish cleaning so cheaply the Chinamen would go home out sheer disgust. E. A. Smith developed this machine, tagging it the ""Iron Chink."" The first machine was sent to the Red Salmon Canning Company in Bristol Bay. A second machine was sent, that same year to Anacortes, Washington. To this day, it is still called the ""Iron Chink."" The machinist who works on it is called the ""Iron Chink"" machinist.


Corporate Mergers


""People of the same trade seldom meet together ever for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some (argument) to raise prices."" This often quoted comment of Adam Smith, author of ""Wealth of Nations"" can easily be applied to the salmon canning industry Where a few canneries in close proximity could, they shared costs by closing down all but one. They produced less but at a higher profit. Chignik Bay canneries and then Karluk River canneries agreed to these terms as early as the season of 1891.


Soon even the distance between various canneries was no longer a factor in the decision to merger for profit's sake. In September, 1891 Alaska canneries had a surplus of 363,000 cases. The temporarily-formed Alaska Packers Association (APA) was created to dispose of the surplus. It was dissolved shortly after its mission was completed, but the necessity of such an organization was very much in the mind of cannery owners. In 1892 31 of 37 Alaska salmon canneries merged to become the Alaska Packers Association. They incorporated in 1893.


Alaska Packers Association


Alaska Packers Association divided Alaska in sections allowing only a few canneries in each area to operate, with the total profits divided among them, according to their share of stock. Out of 31 members in 1893, only 8 were allowed to open.


To demonstrate the power of Alaska Packers Association, the story of the ""1903 Salmon War"" must be related. The Pacific Packing and Navigation Company (PPNC) based in New Jersey, proposed to consolidate operation of a number of canneries to provide control over four-fifths of the world's market for canned salmon.


Alaska Packers Association took up the challenge. 1902 found them with 1,223,000 cases of 1901 and 1902 surplus. APA represented 50 per cent of all canneries, Pacific Packing and Navigation Company had 30 per cent of Alaska canneries and no surplus. Alaska Packers Association used its surplus to drive 1903 prices down to 16 cents a dozen. Within three months, PPNC was in receivership.


Another dominant figure in cannery organizations has been the Alaska Salmon Industry, Inc. It was temporarily formed in 1934 to represent the industry in the National Recovery. Administration of the salmon industry in San Francisco. (Further information on NRA investigations will be in following issues.) From this merger came a realization that an organization such as this would be extremely helpful to individual cannery companies. (APA at this time had become a subsidiary of the Del Monte Company based in California.) It was incorporated in 1940, its initial role that of collective bargaining agent for the industry.


Another organization formed by corporate merger was the Association of Pacific Fisheries, formed in 1914. It is responsible for initiating fishery conservation legislation, researching information relevant to fisheries, and disseminating information developed.


The Northwest Branch of the National Canners Association began in 1917 as an offshoot of the National Canners Association (founded in 1907). This organization consists of nearly 100 per cent of all Alaska salmon canneries. Another organization the Salmon Terminal Inc., was formed to handle . . . and storage of packers salmon . . . too, is based in Seattle.

Heng-Pia Kiang, Mitsue Doniego and Ruth Chinn were nominated to fill the vacancy left by Dr. Roy S. Mar who recently resigned his position on the Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (Public Corporation). Nominations will not close until the next meeting Wednesday, May 11.


Approximately 40 persons attended the April 20 quarterly public constituency meeting held at the Eight Immortals Restaurant. Most were area residents. Many lived in the Bush Hotel, site of the proposed community center.


Questions about the future of the Bush Hotel were raised. As of this month's meeting, the sale of the Bush had yet to be finalized.


During the meeting, many of the audience's questions were answered with, ""I don't know."" But some information was transmitted.


Ben Woo, public corporation chairperson, said, ""Some rooms at the Bush will be upgraded with private bathrooms or enlarged. The projected rent will be $79 a month. Four floors will be used for housing.""


Woo was asked about the inconvenience to Bush Hotel residents of having to move. ""There will be opportunity for (monetary) compensation,"" Woo replied.


Jerry Arai, architect for the project, told the Examiner it would probably take two years to complete the Bush Hotel community center project.


Arai said the actual renovation would take about a year to a year-and-a-half. The study and planning, he said, would take about eight months.

Supporters of the Milwaukee Hotel tenants have received over 300 signatures on a petition to the owners of the Hotel. The petition, which calls on the owners to immediately turn on heat in the building and complete all repairs by scheduled dates, was circulated throughout the International District.


In a February 7 meeting, the tenants decided to present the petition to Jordan Wong and Don Louie, the owners, during the week of February 14. The signatures on the petition were mostly those of International District residents.


The owners have neglected the property, International District Housing Alliance (IDHA) members said. The Building Department has threatened to close the hotel unless necessary repairs are made to bring the building up to standard.


In October, the Building Department set two deadlines for completion of repairs. The heat, electrical wiring, and sanitation were to be taken care of by February 5, 1977. Eight other code violations must be corrected by August 5, 1977.


""In the wintertime it is so cold that we are forced to use our hot plates to dry out clothes and try to warm up,"" remarked one elderly Chinese woman. She has been a resident of the hotel for over 10 years.


The heat was turned on for two days and turned off again, said Ken Mar of the IDHA. Nothing has been done, he said, about the electrical wiring and the sanitation.


Some rooms have no electrical outlets. Even tenants in rooms with outlets must be careful to use only one outlet at a time, to prevent circuit overloads. Some rooms have ovens that cannot be used because there is no gas output necessary to run them.


The general sanitation in the hotel remains poor. The walls of the small rooms are in poor condition, with the paint and plaster peeling, cracking or chipping off.


There are no locks on the main entrances. The halls are dimly lit and the staircase bannisters are dirty and sticky. The rooms occupied by tenants have no locks, thereby creating targets for theft. The tenants have to padlock their doors from the outside, which clearly indicates when no one is home.


The hotel has been inhabited for over 60 years. There are seven families and elderly Chinese women living there now. Some cannot speak English which poses a problem for them if they have to relocate.


The owners have increased the rent by live dollars a month. Notification of the increase was given at the beginning of February. The tenants are willing to pay the increase, said Mar, but not until repairs are made.


Damages from a fire last December have been repaired. The repairs were financed through insurance money.


The estimated cost of the building's renovation is near $300,000.

An important private collection of Japanese art is on display at the Seattle Art Museum through May 1.


""Japanese Art: Selections from the Mary and Jackson Burke Collection"" consists of more than 100 pieces of artwork: painting, sculpture, ceramics, lacquer and other media. The display depicts almost every major aspect in the development of Japanese art.


There are sculptures and paintings from the 10th through the 14th centuries. They show both religious and secular art in the classical tradition. The Muromachi period is represented by over 20 paintings and a rare pair of screens attributed to Shubun.


There are numerous hanging scrolls, handscrolls, screens, fan and album paintings representing varied painting styles from the 16th through the 19th centuries. The paintings include, the formal Kano school, dynamic gold-decorated screens, the ukiyo-e style, drawings displaying the eccentric vision of artists Shohaku and Jakuchu.


The Rimpa and Nanga schools are well represented by 40 works by major artists such as Sotatsu, Koetsu, Korin, Kenzan, Taiga, Buson, Gyokudo and Mokubei. On display are exquisite tea ceremony utensils and metalwork.


Additional paintings and ceramics acquired since the collection was first exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1975 will be shown here.


In 1963, the Burkes began assembling a collection of Japanese art, in which Jackson took a very strong personal interest until his death in 1975. Their first acquisition was a group of colorful 18th and 19th century Ukiyo-e paintings. They then obtained refined objects of the 12th and 13th centuries. Next, they obtained artwork expressing the personal idiom of Nanga school painting.


The Seattle Art Museum, located at Volunteer Park, is hosting the only West Coast viewing of the collection. It will travel to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts from here.


The exhibit affords viewers a special opportunity to experience a panoramic view of Japanese art.

Gambling charges against 32 Filipino men arrested in a police raid on the Retiree Association, 513 S. King St., were dismissed February 28 in Municipal Court.


Anthony Savage, defense attorney, said the charges were dropped ""because the City admitted they could not show (the men) were engaged in professional gambling as defined by state law.""


To obtain a conviction, the City must show someone was trying to make a living from the proceeds, or taking a percentage out of the pot, he said.


""All they had was a bunch of elderly men sitting around and playing cards,"" Savage said.


The games at the Retiree Association are similar to ones held at the Washington Athletic Club, said Maria Ambalada, investigator with the Public Defender's office. Hinting at the possibility of discrimination, she said the ""stakes are higher"" at the Athletic Club, but no one is arrested there.


Most of those arrested, she said, were elderly men who live by themselves in older hotels. ""They don't want to be alone,"" she said. They go to the Association to eat, socialize, and meet friends, remarked Ambalada.


The games were held by the Association in a building owned by Evangelista Lodge, she said. But contrary to early news reports, there is no connection between the Lodge and the games, she said.


Ambalada said the raid upset the men. The police did not have a warrant with them (at the time), nevertheless, ""they went in a drew guns,"" Ambalada said.


Two men were charged with operating a gambling house. The others were charged with being present where gambling was carried on. All 32 pleaded innocent.


Three men forfeited bail, according to Savage. All other charges were dismissed. The case was not appealed.

The highlight of the International District May Day celebration was a talk given by Al Masigat of the International District Housing Alliance (IDHA).


The May Day celebration, held in the Chinese Information Center May 1, is a traditional day when the working class unites to celebrate its victories and renew and strengthen its commitment to continue to fight for the rights denied them.


Masigat, who came to Seattle in 1927, has watched the changing character of the International District. He noted that the International District is made up of various races. ""We have a harmony,"" he said. ""There is unity where there used to be racial tension.""


When Masigat came to the United States, he found ""deep discrimination against Asians.""


""There was no unity,"" Masigat said. ""Each group was only for themselves.""


He explained that when he first complained about the poor housing conditions in the International District, he did so as an individual and was told by the managers of the hotels that if he didn't like it he could get out.


Masigat cited 1972 as the beginning of unity in the International District.


""This is when people united against the Domed Stadium,"" he said. ""Because of the Domed Stadium, only 18 of 43 hotels still are open. This, he said, is because of ""big business, whose favorite past time is to bleed us, the old, the poor.""


He pointed out that the IDHA has made some gains for residents in the area of housing. He said a 99-unit housing project is scheduled to be built on Weller Street. The Bush Hotel is also scheduled to be renovated. And insurance money has been obtained to repair fire damage to the Milwaukee Hotel on King Street.


But Masigat was quick to warn people not to let the recent gains ""blot from our minds that we are in danger of eviction.""


He emphasized that International District residents must unite for housing and health care and to fight eviction.


""Unite now,"" he said. ""Tomorrow may be too late.""

""The theory that Asian Americans are assimilated is politically motivated and racist,"" said Ling-Chi Wang, assistant professor and coordinator of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Berkele.


Wang, speaking on ""The Model Minority Syndrome and Public Policy,"" the last in a series of symposiums on mental health sponsored by the University of Washington Ethnic Studies program, said assimilationist theories for Asians are just another repressive instrument to divide Asians from other minorities.


""The height of the Black civil rights movement in the 60's coincided with the appearance of the model minority theory of Asians,"" he went on to say. He cited articles in Newsweek and Time magazine, scholarly journals, and mass media, which portrayed Asians as economically successful. Blacks, on the other hand, were portrayed as riotous and lazy. ""In essence, they were making legitimate demands,"" he said.


There is no material basis for such a theory, he maintained, citing statistics which point to segmentation of Asians into all lower levels of technical fields.


""Asian Americans have an obligation to expose scholars and the government who apply the term to Asians,"" he said.


""Asians were lured here when there was an economic demand for cheap labor."" Wang said, but when their labor was no longer needed, they were cast aside as ""unassimilable."" The governor of California stated in the early 1850's that ""Asians are mentally and morally inferior even to Blacks,"" Wang said.


Anti-Chinese and anti-Fllipino exclusionary acts didn't just accidentally coincide with the Great Depression, he said.


""Trying hard to cast aside their unassimilable character, second and third-generation Asians flocked to education, spending all their money and time in schools."" he said. ""It was, an alternative, but not really."" Wang said Japanese Americans, prior to World War II, had a higher, educational level than Whites, but their incomes were much lower.


The outbreak of World War II established a new trend for Asian Americans. Often viewed as a turning point for Chinese in America, the War provided vast opportunities in war-related jobs for Chinese. He noted that the Chinese Exclusionary Act was repealed in 1943, and a provision included for Chinese citizenship. But Wang emphasized that such events reflected a war time phenomena, rather than true acceptance of Chinese."" The true basis for the changes, he said, was the need for their skills. Filipinos also went through the same recruitment process he added.


America's true attitude towards Asians, he said, was reflected in the incarceration of Japanese Americans into concentration camps during World War II.


He cited four metropolitan areas, which contain 48 percent of the United States Asian population. Wang noted a present concentration of Asians in five industries -- garment, hotel, banking, restaurant and insurance -- and all in lower positions and at lower income levels than whites. ""There is no correlation between education and jobs (for Asians) as a race, he said.


Asked what other strategies should be taken by Asians it education is not a means for advancement, Wang said, ""change the economic structure.""

(part five in a series)


After Duyungan's death, Conrad Espe, a unionist acquired when the Cannery Workers and Field Laborers Union (CWFLU) joined the Maritime Federation of the Pacific, took the leading role in the union. Although the union was able to end the contract hiring system, all was not smooth sailing.


The cannery workers were predominately a migrant labor force employed in the fields during the off-season. Under the leadership of Duyungan and Espe, the CWFLU made numerous attempts to organize field workers of the winter months. Farm Division organizers proceeded to unionize agricultural workers in Yakima, Kent, Everett and the White River area. In Kent, they were met by vigilante groups, led by the town's mayor. In Yakima, they were met with imprisonment. Local officials and the police, again, led the vigilante groups.


The American Federation of Labor was very divided between the craft and industrial trade lines. The craft line limited the strength of the AFL. John L. Lewis, advocated the industrial trade line, the faction which split and formed the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO). AFL Local 18257 members considered affiliation with the CIO.


Reaffiliation


The American Federation of Labor leadership, to ward off the possibility of the stronger militant unions joining the CIO, began initiating divisive tactics. In April, Leo Flynn proposed the division of all cannery unions into racially autonomous unions. He chartered Clarance Arai's Local 20545, a Japanese group, and appealed to the other races to follow suit. He also announced that these various unions would be governed by a board headed by Conrad Espe.


These AFL tactics increased the number of cannery workers who wished to reaffiliate. In the winter of 1937, plans were begun to establish an international of cannery, packinghouse and field workers under the affiliation of the CIO.


In the salmon canning industry, the American Federation of Labor demanded that employers only recognize. Local 20454 during the 1937 negotiations. Local 18257 responded by obtaining a temporary restraining court order. Local 18257 immediately proceeded to negotiate for an eight-hour day, closed union shop and wage increases.


The Japanese union led by Clarance Arai set up picket lines in an attempt to keep the workers dispatched by Local 18257 from going north. It was May Day, 1937. Appropriately, the cannery workers showed their unity by marching 1200 strong through Local 20454's picket lines. This delegation later marched in the May Day parade. It was heralded as the largest unit in the whole demonstration.


The American Federation of Labor suspended Local 18257 for disregarding the picket lines. The AFL urged the Seattle Central Labor Council (SCLC) to deny them support. Both the SCLU and the Maritime Federation of Labor defended CWFLU and commended them for their militant stand.


About this time, Local 18257 delegates were returning from the founding congress held in Denver during July, 1937. The delegates reported the formation of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packinghouse and Allied Workers of America-CIO (UCAPAWA). This newly-created international took farm, cannery, packinghouse and dairy farm workers under its jurisdiction.


The returning delegates strongly urged CWFLU to reaffiliate. On November 4, 1937, the rank-and-file showed its approval by voting strongly in favor of reaffiliation to the CIO. Local 18257-AFL became Local 7-CIO, a member of UCAPAWA.


UCAPAWA's ranks swelled to 124,750 by December, 1938. Among its most militant members were those in the Alaska Cannery Workers unions. These were Local 7 in Seattle, Local 5 in San Francisco and Local 226 in Portland. Between these three locals, 6,000 cannery workers provided up to one-half the funds necessary to create UCAPAWA.


Intimidation and Disruption


Following Local 18257's reaffiliation, the AFL and the industry began tactics of intimidation and disruption. The AFL issued a charter to John Ayamo, and other members who opposed reaffiliation. They were given the old AFL charter of Local 18257, called the ""Defeated Candidates Party"" by Local 7 members. Local 18257 immediately began a red baiting campaign. Conrad Espe and his cohorts were called the ""Communist Comics"" from then on.


The industry followed this move by publically announcing it would only deal with AFL unions. This announcement was made by the Canned Salmon Industry, Inc. (CSI). This organization, by 1937, had taken on advertisement and negotiation responsibilities for the various Alaska canning companies.


On February 15, 1938, CSI issued press releases with the same messages. Exlabor contractors joined in the attack by offering free meals in their restaurants to any and all who would surrender their CIO books. Local 7-CIO responded by filing a complaint of unfair labor practices with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).


The intimidation and disruptive tactics temporarily subsided. But then they began to pick up again. The AFL began collborating with the immigration department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Many Local 7 members were arrested under various bogus charges. Local 7 immediately applied for a NLRB consent audit.


The company foremen held a meeting on April 1, 1938. Following this meeting each foreman was given the names of 20 crew members they were to coerce into voting for Local 18257 under the threat of losing their jobs.


The NLRB stepped in after the Local 7 leadership again filed claims against the industry for unfair labor practices.


The result of the Consent Audit was: Local 7, 1597 votes; Local 18257, 685 votes; neutral 504.


A new election


A new election, to begin May 4, was set by the NLRB. The industry and the AFL again began intimidating cannery workers. C.A. Abella, the secretary of Local 7, was arrested. No formal charges were filed. Other members of the rank-and-file were harrassed on the streets and hotel rooms were searched.


The Mayor of Seattle, having close ties with the industry, pushed the police chief into consistently applying police intimidation upon Local 7 members. He went as far as informing the NLRB that the local police would provide a riot team at the election site. NLRB Representative McClaskey asked the U.S. Marshal to overrule the police chief.


The U.S. Marshal informed the Police Chief that any supervision of the election would be done by his office.


Both unions hotly competed for the votes of the rank-and-file. On election day, numerous fist fights and arguments broke out. Election supervisors created two lines, one for Local 18257 and the other for Local 7.


Following the four-day election, the rank-and-file crowded around the election site waiting for the results. Local 7 won: 1560 to 1307.


The AFL refused to sanction the election. Local 18257 followed with a protest to the NLRB. May 10, 1938, Local 18257 attempted to dispatch its workers. The CIO picketed the Alaska Transportation Docks and, with the support of the Maritime Federation of the Pacific, no AFL workers were dispatched. On May 11, Local 7 in turn dispatched its crews through an AFL picket line.


Local 7 negotiates


With this victory under its belt, Local 7-CIO went into negotiations with the industry. By this time, the Canned Salmon Industry, Inc. had formally recognized the CIO. Both AFL unions subsequently died out. The cannery workers had to accept a 14 per cent wage cut. The industry had made special appeals to both the union and the government, stressing the drastic reduction in the profits of previous years.


On December 15, John Ayamo successfully applied for a AFL charter to form the Alaska Fish Cannery Workers Union of the Pacific under the jurisdiction of the Seafarers International Union. His union recruited 190 men, covering six companies. Today, this union is located at 5th Ave. and Main Street.


I.R. Cabatit was president of Local 7-CIO during these attacks by the industry and the ousted contractors.


Trinidad Rojo became president in 1939. CWFLU Local 7 was on the verge of bankruptcy, a total of 13,000 dollars in debt. It was discovered that officers under Cabatit had been selling membership cards, charging personal purchases on union accounts, and slipping away early, ignoring their work.


Rojo drew up a strict budget, cut the number of employees in half and implemented a system of authorized expenditures only.


The wages of officers dropped from $35 and $20 a week to $7 and $5 Fundraisers were held to help support the floundering union. The union, in return to the workers, was able to negotiate a 33 per cent increase in wages. Overtime pay was raised to 60c an hour. In addition the union gained the right to appoint all foremen.


During Rojo's term, World War II broke out. Trinidad Rojo declined the nomination for the presidency in 1940. His successor was Vincente O Navea.

(part four in a series)


After the stockmarket crash of 1929, businesses shut down, unemployment lines grew longer and deprivation flourished. The recession became the Depression. Hoovervilles and breadlines were common sights.


The Depression naturally hit the salmon industry. Many canneries were forced to temporarily close. Job competition sharpened and exploitation increased. Cannery employers saw the oversupply of workers as a chance to increase profits by lowering wages. Food and housing became less desirable, wages continued to decrease.


Many workers became dissatisfied. Contrary to common belief, Asian cannery workers organized. They collectively demanded their rights as workers.


To gain better working conditions, Chinese and Japanese in Hawaii resorted to organized sabotage, work stoppage and strikes.


In the early 1900's, eight thousand Japanese and Filipino workers walked out of the sugar cane fields to protest low wages.


Farmers organized associations that doubled as vigilante groups and Congressional lobbyists. California had its Associated Farmers, Western Growers Protective Association and the American Institution Inc. Thousands of vigilantes posing as legal deputies could be mobilized upon a moment's notice.


Organized labor added to the barrier to keep Asians unorganized. The Knights of Labor, so-called labor solidarity unionists, ruled that Asians could not become members of their order. Furthermore, it said Asians were not fit to reside in the United States.


The American Federation of Labor, under Samuel Gompers, led organized labor's move to exclude Chinese from this country. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was the fruit of their labor.


Appeal for Support


In 1903, the Sugar Beet and Farm Laborers Union of Oxnard, a predominately Japanese union, appealed for American Federation of Labor support. Samuel Gompers responded by demanding the Oxnard union guarantee not to accept Chinese or Japanese workers under any circumstances.


Even in Seattle, the Central Labor Council (CLC), a long-time progressive trade union, passed a 1929 resolution which begins: ""Whereas the CLC has been informed upon what it regards as good authority that many if not all of the Filipinos who are coming into Seattle are former inhabitants of the island of Luzon, where for many generations past there has been going on a mixing of the most undesirable elements of the Mongolian race...""


Despite these barriers, Asians organized. They participated in the Industrial Workers of the World. In the early 1900's, Asians formed the Sugar Beet and Farm Laborers Union of Oxnard. When the Depression struck and exploitation was at its worst and the greater labor community of America organized, Asians, too, were organizing. Asians founded the Cannery and Allied Workers Industrial Union, Filipino Protective Union and the Filipino Labor Union Inc.


Unionization in the Alaska canneries was a rarity; the contractors' hold on workers was too strong. Nevertheless, the Industrial Workers of the World established Local 283 in a Ketchikan cannery in 1913. In 1932, under the leadership of men like Virgil Duyungan, Antonio Rodriguez, Felix Misland and ""Brother"" Espirito, cannery workers began organizing a union in Seattle.


These early attempts at unionization met with little initial success. Filipino cannery workers had experienced a history of persecution and betrayal by their friends and benefactors: the contractors. The migratory life of most cannery workers restricted year-round maintenance of union membership. Many of these men, removed from the union for long periods of time, became distrustful of union leaders.


Year-round membership


The early union leaders knew an ""espirit de corps"" could only be maintained with year-round membership. And only with a membership that included all races. Salmon cannery workers who, during the winter season worked in the fields of California, would have to maintain membership in a permanent year-round union. Consistent organizing led to acquisition of an American Federation of Labor charter on June 19, 1933. The Cannery Workers and Field Laborers Union (CWFLU) was formally recognized as the first union with jurisdiction over cannery and field laborers.


The following summer brought little success. The AFL Local 18257, in an attempt to gain strength, joined forces with the former lawyer of contractor, John Ayamo. The lawyer traveled to San Francisco to represent the Cannery Workers and Field Laborers Union during the National Recovery Act (NRA) code hearings. The salmon canning industry was being investigated. The NRA hearings resulted, at least nominally, in the outlawing of the contract system for exploitation of workers.


With this victory behind them, Local 18257 returned to a respirited organizing drive. About this time, the Maritime Union of the Pacific Coast went on strike. Local 18257 appealed for their support. And they received it. To gain a job in Alaska for the season of 1934, CWFLU membership was mandatory.


Meanwhile, Local 18257 collectively bargained for a $25 raise to an unprecedented $50 a month. The membership of Local 18257 increased into the thousands. When new members returned to Seattle, dissension arose. President Duyungan, insisting upon a year-round union, demanded additional fees and union dues. Many members realized the necessity of maintaining the union and gladly paid. Many others said the union had taken on the same role as the contractors and refused to pay.


The union gains


The contractors' earlier tactics of keeping workers constantly in debt by advancing funds, providing credit for food, clothing and housing, had been overcome by the gains of the union during the season of 1934.


When intimidation of workers through threats, blacklisting and coercion began to lose effect, the workers established the Filipino Protective Laborers Association (FPLA). The Association stressed cultural, social, mental and physical development of its membership. It continued practicing contracted dispatching to the canneries. It organized in time to successfully pull in many dissenting union members.


FPLA published the Philippine Advocate; CWFLU, the Philippine American Chronicle.


CWFLU, in a last effort to ensure a successful 1935 season, approached the striking Maritime and Tanker and Northwest lumber workers. The total confusion within the cannery scene led to an investigation by AFL officials, the U.S. Labor Department and, finally, the Maritime Federation of Labor. The Maritime found Local 18257 and the FPLA guilty of many questionable practices. It demonstrated its dissatisfaction by immediately withdrawing support. Mechanization also hit the salmon canning industry. It eliminated 25 to 35 per cent of all jobs in Alaska and shortened work time by one half.


Immigration quota


Congress passed the Tyding McDuffie Law which set Filipino immigration quotas of 50 per year. This cut off the source of the labor pool which the Alaska salmon canning industry had exploited. It brought a temporary halt to job competition. It also brought an element of haste to those who wanted to develop an effective union to ensure preservation of cannery jobs.


The 1935 season ended in little gain to workers.


In 1936, the FPLA and the CWFLU began conciliatory talks. The FPLA had experienced a major division between its members. After CWFLU gained a $5 raise for the 1935 season, dissenting members of FPLA merged with CWFLU. FPLA dissolved and CWFLU's ranks rose to 2,500.


With added members, Local 18257 set a goal of ending the contract system within the 1937 season and establishing the eight-hour day. At this time, the union already reduced the 12-hour day to 10.


The contractors and employers, realizing the union was there to stay, attempted one last tactic to stop the salmon canning industry from total unionization.


On December 1, 1936, at the Gyoken Restaurant, CWFLU officers and contractors were meeting to discuss the coming season. Beseda Patron, a nephew of a contractor, assassinated Local 18257 President Virgil Duyungan and Secretary Aurelio Simon. Prior to this attack, Duyungan and his family had repeatedly been threatened. For protection, Duyungan got a permit to carry a gun. He reportedly returned fire and killed his assassin.


Duyungan's funeral march brought out thousands of Maritime workers. They spanned six blocks of downtown Seattle. The strength of workers in unity was demonstrated. With this as inspiration, the CWFLU Local 18257 ended the contractor's reign in the salmon canning industry by the season of 1937.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Nihonmachi was once a large 25-block community. It's now four blocks. And as one member of the Committee Against Nihonmachi Eviction (CANE) states, Nihomachi is ""under threat of eviction and has been for years.""


CANE, formed four years ago, consists of Japanese American students, workers, shopkeepers and other Third World supporters who seek to prevent redevelopers from taking over Japantown or Nihomachi.


Based on the westside of Nihomachi inside an old Victorian house, CANE sponsors free tours of Japantown, focusing on the history of the area and the detrimental effects of redevelopment.


CANE is working to prevent the eviction of tenants living in the Victorian buildings which redevelopers intend to sell, either for restoration or replacement. If these buildings are sold and the tenants driven out, later, the buildings will be so costly to rent that Japantown residents will be forced out of the area, CANE members state.


Organized shopkeepers


Recently, CANE organized with community shopkeepers to prevent prospective buyers from inspecting the Sutter/Laguna buildings. Tenants locked up their shops and supporters formed block-long picket lines RDA (Redevelopment Agency) postponed the bidding process, but, according to CANE, RDA has no intention of meeting tenants' demands for decent living conditions.


Japantown began in 1910, after the Earthquake. The Japanese formed a community here because there was no other place they could settle, and a strong resentment against the Japanese following the war drew them together. Japan-town became known as the ""least desirable place to live.""


Now, the idea is to make Japantown a tourist attraction. Ten years after the war, Kintetsu Enterprises, a tourist oriented corporation, undertook projects to redevelop Japantown. The building of the Trade Center and the widening of Geary Boulevard and bordering streets were part of the project.


A CANE member noted that the streets forming the border of Japantown were widened primarily to serve as boundaries of separation from the neighboring, predominantly black community this made Japantown a ""desirable"" neighborhood.


Low income housing


CANE has pressured the government to provide low income housing for the community, but the government has not responded concretely. A vacant lot on Post and Webster St., the site of a proposed low rent housing project, has remained vacant for the past seven years.


Two forces work within the community: the business people and the shopkeepers. CANE members say they're attempting to prevent big business from driving out the shopkeepers. CANE attributes redevelopment to ""a master plan."" This master plan is, one CANE member says, ""how government through agencies, politicians, courts, etc are set up to serve the interests of corporations.""


The CANE member cites the Japanese concentration camps during the war as the most brutal example of the master plan, arguing that ""Japanese were not put in camps for 'national security' reasons, but were put there primarily to benefit agri-business and real estate interests.""


Nihonmachi is being developed into a tourist center as part of the master plan, according to CANE. Small shops and family restauratns which have served the community for many years have been replaced by tourist oriented restaurants, hotels, and stores.


Big Japanese business


The Trade Center housed businesses that depict the corporate economy of Japan. Kikkomann and Hitachi have showrooms to display their products. A CANE member said, ""The products sold in the Trade Center stereotype Japanese culture because of the emphasis on pearls, cameras, flower arrangements, and antiques. Small shopkeepers cannot build a business in the Trade Center because the rent is so high and much too costly.""


Also, with the expansion of the financial district, Japantown has become even more appealing because of its proximity to downtown. CANE says Japantown is being remodeled to attract not only tourists but also junior executives who can purchase housing in one of the many new apartment buildings with studio and one-bedroom apartments. For a studio apartment, the rent begins at $200.


Thus, with the influx of investors, the low rent housing which served the families of the Nihonmachi has either been destroyed or renovated, with the rent subsequently doubling or tripling. As one CANE member put it, ""Progress is a dirty word.""

Former Mayor Wes Uhlman and Dan Dingfield are preparing a feasibility study on development of the old Union Station into a transportation terminal with a parking garage, hotel and office space.


A similar plan, explored several years ago by the Port of Seattle, provoked strong community opposition and was eventually dropped when the Port decided the plan would not be feasible without federal assurance of $15 million to $20 million.


According to the old proposal, the Port would develop a central terminal for the various bus services, Amtrak, taxi service and bus connections with the Sea-Tac Airport.


The community expressed mixed reactions to revival of the plan at a meeting at the Wing Luke Museum May 31.


Uhlman told community representatives the Port staff is ""not overly enthused"" about the proposal. But he said if the station is not developed in two or three years, it won't be salvagable.


""It's a good site (for the transportation module) if it is developed,"" Uhlman said. ""But it will not be developed without community support. We want to get community feedback, then put it together into a report and dump it on the Port's desk.""


Earlier this month, Uhlman went to Washington D.C. to explore possible federal funding to subsidize development of the proposal.


Uhlman said an intermodal transportation terminal at the Union Station could take in the bus stations presently located downtown. ""At this point in time, the Port has been subsidizing the more wealthy traveller at the (Sea-Tac) Airport,"" said Uhlman. ""There is no subsidy of the poorer traveller who has to travel by bus.""


The old plan, which community representatives had complained was created without regard for the International District, called for a 2200 car parking garage, a 300-unit hotel complex and facilities for major retail outlets. The new proposal may be scaled down considerably.


Don Chin, Chong Wah Benevolent Association representative, said the transportation terminal would be ""a good thing for the International District, a good thing for the business community."" He said the terminal would be an advantage for poorer people who have to take the bus and would bring more business into the District.


""He forgets one thing,"" responded Al Masigat, a resident. ""Of course, it will benefit business. But if the terminal will be built here again -- and I say again because I opposed the Domed Stadium. When the Domed Stadium was built, everything went up. The rent was 20 or 25 dollars before the Stadium, but afterwards it went up to double. If you (Uhlman) give a commitment to residents that the price of rent will not go up ...""


Uhlman said he could not give such a commitment: ""There's a danger of having too many low-income people clustered in one area of the city. This should not be the dumping ground for all the low-income people in the city.""


James Yee, also from Chong Wah, said the proposal should consider how the traffic pattern in the District will be affected. ""Is it going to strangle the District? he asked.


Dingfield said the old proposal to build a 2200 car parking garage was not economically feasible. He said the parking structure was too far away to serve people who wanted to shop in Pioneer Square. He said the new proposal might just serve the parking needs of the employees on the site and the needs of the transportation module.


Dingfield pointed out that if the second and third floor of the Union Station are renovated, there could be 45,000 feet of office space to accommodate 300 to 350 employees. The Immigration and Naturalization Service on Airport Way has been forced to vacate its old premises, and may be located at the Union Station, he said.


Dingfield added that he and Uhlman, acting as consultants to the Port of Seattle, are looking at the alternative possibility of building a new bus terminal downtown, near the 8th Ave. and Steward area. But, he said, the federal government would be less likely to provide assistance on a project like that.


Dingfield said their feasibility report will be ready by July. The report, he said, would include the concerns of the community, the willingness of transportation people to participate and the amount of federal participation available and potential sources of money. The design work could be done in early 1978, he said, and an environmental impact statement could be ready by mid-1979.


Diane Sugimura, chairperson of the Special Review Board, said Uhlman and Dingfield want to have another meeting with the community near the end of the month.


But, Uhlman said, if substantial community opposition develops against the proposal, ""we would tell (the Port) not to waste their time with it.""

There has been a changing of the guard at the Chong Wah Benevolent Association.


The new officers are: Harry Woo, president; Mark Wut, vice president; Peter Lee, Chinese secretary; James Yee and Don Chin, English secretaries; and Huy Hang Tsun, treasurer.


This group says it is eager and willing to work with the larger Asian community, which has not been the case for several years. An example is the participation of Chong with Inter*Im on a petition to eliminate hazardous traffic and develop four-way stop signs in the core of the International District.


""This shows a positive change for Chong Wah,"" stated Bob Santos, Inter*Im director.


However, Chong Wah's new attitude remains cautious. Observers say this could be leftover from the days when Ruby Chow was president of Chong Wah, or it could be that the new group does not wish to be misunderstood.


Chong Wah, one of the oldest Chinese associations in the United States, is final mediator of unsettled conflicts or disputes between the numerous family associations and tongs. It's also non-profit and non-political.


Even though Chong Wah flies the Taiwan flag on holidays, says Harry Woo, ""we're not associated with the Taiwan government. We support the United States.""


A main function of Chong Wah is to act as liason between the Chinese people and the larger community. James Yee said, ""Chong Wah is still the focal point for the Chinese community in terms of speaking for it. Whether or not people respect us is another thing.""


A petition was recently circulated to have King Street, the core of the District, withdraw from the International District Special Review Board (IDSRB) boundaries. The new Chong Wah group denied that Chong Wah sponsored the petition. The group said there is no sponsor's name on the petition and that they just recently became aware of it. They will remain neutral, they say, until the City of Seattle contacts them about it.


In the past, the IDSRB and Chong Wah have been on opposite sides on several issues. A meeting between the two groups demonstrates a new willingness on the part of both groups to work together.


Chong Wah feels the IDSRB needs to change its image from one of a group which just vetoes to one that will help the Chinese community develop economically and socially. ""The IDSRB is a good thing,"" stated Yee. ""They're supposed to understand the (development) guidelines . . . a lot of Chinese don't know (about the guidelines). They can serve a valuable function to the community just by explaining the guidelines.""


Yee recommended that if differences arise between Chinese groups or individuals and the IDSRB, ""It would be a good step to have the Board come to Chong Wah for help or advice.""


In a recent city-sponsored questionnaire, Chong Wah stated that the IDSRB is needed and should continue. In the questionnaire, Chong Wah stated that low-income housing was the first priority for the area. It would like to see the area with a mixture of low-income housing, market rate housing, and small businesses.


Chong Wah still views the area as ""Chinatown"" and not the International District. Chong Wah says it recognizes the political need to call the area International District. The group realizes many of the projects and monies that have been coming into the area would not be possible if it were only Chinatown.


Public agencies, in their funding consideration to neighborhoods, recognize the area as the International District and not Chinatown.


The Chong Wah Benevolent Association is changing, but is still very cautious. The full effect probably will not be felt until five years down the road.


The Chong Wah board is still entrenched with older, traditional Chinese. Over 50 per cent of the board members are 45 years or older.


""We're trying to recruit new talents into the Chong Wah,"" stated Harry Woo.


Chong Wah is also trying to have bilingual monthly meetings to accommodate the non-Chinese-speaking-members.

Over 2000 Japanese Americans joined by numerous public officials assembled at the Puyallup Fairgrounds late last month to participate in ""A Day of Remembrance."" It was a remembrance of that rainy day in American history 36 years ago when 7200 Seattle area Japanese American men, women, and children were up-rooted from their homes and ordered to assemble at the fairgrounds in Puyallup, designated ""Camp Harmony"" by the American military.


The crowd spent the afternoon examinating artwork, exhibits, and news clippings saved by former camp residents. Slide shows and skits about the internment were also given, but the majority of the time was spent listening to speakers share evacuation and internment experiences.


One former camp resident who remembers those days well is Shosuke Sasaki.


He remembers the selling and giving away of family possessions to friends, because there wasn't enough room to take them with them.


He remembers the sad hours he and his family spent standing in the drizzling rain clutching their possessions on the corner of 8th and Pine, waiting for that bus caravan 36 years ago that would eventually transport them to Camp Harmony.


And he remembers the prejudice and hatred felt toward all persons of Japanese ancestry during the early days of the war.


One incident in particular stands out in Sasaki's mind.


On the bus ride to Camp Harmony, Sasaki recalls, the caravan stopped at a local gas station to refuel. Because it had been a long wait, some of the Japanese Americans began leaving the buses to utilize the restrooms. But before they reached them, a gas station attendant came out and locked the restroom doors, so, as he put it, ""the JAPS couldn't use them.""


Such were the times, and such were the experiences former camp residents shared with the rest of the participants at ""A Day of Remembrance.""


The day was not entirely spent dwelling on the past, but also preparing and planning future actions.


Ron Mamiya, organizer of the event, and Redress Chairman for the JACL Pacific Northwest District Council, announced that efforts are being made to introduce a bill into the United States Congress to provide financial reparations to every Japanese American interned in the camps.


According to Mamiya, the purpose of the bill is threefold. First, it is to make the American public aware of the evacuation, second, to educate the public as to the facts of the evacuation, and finally, to deter the possibility of any future occurrences.


To Gordon Hirabayashi, professor at the University of Alberta, and longtime champion of Japanese American civil rights, this bill presents a golden opportunity to ""clear the name of the Japanese American people . . . and to assume our positions as first class citizens.""


Hirabayashi is concerned that, even today, there is still no mention of the evacuation of 100,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast in any of American history textbooks. This, together with the fear that further inaction may imply past guilt, leads him to believe that ultimate passage of the redress bill is of the utmost importance.


Silence, Hirabayashi contends, will leave the Japanese American name vulnerable to the following circular reasoning by future uninformed generations.


They may believe, he says, that no country, much less the United States, would uproot and imprison an entire group of people without reason, and since the Japanese Americans were uprooted and imprisoned, then they must have been guilty. This, he says, is simply faulty reasoning leading to a false conclusion.


Hirabayashi sees the passage of the Redress bill as the only certain way to prevent such faulty reasoning, and to ""clear the Japanese American name"" once and for all.


To critics of the monetary element of the proposed bill, Hirabayashi explains that the money is purely symbolic, and relatively unimportant.


""It is merely something tangible to represent the intangible injuries that were suffered,"" he said.


After all, Hirabayashi contends, ""how many of us would be willing today to be uprooted from our homes, friends and resettled in camps scattered throughout the West for a mere $25,000?""

Issei Concerns, founder of the Seattle Keiro Nursing Home for elderly Japanese, has received a 50 percent matching grant of $130,000 from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation in Tokyo for the Keiro expansion project.


The grant was officially approved by the Japanese Ministry of Transportation. The recommendation for awarding the funds to the Keiro project was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.


Ryoichi Sasakawa, president of the Shipbuilding Foundation, stated the grant was to be used for the care and welfare of Issei pioneers who ""underwent extreme hardships to establish a foothold in America for themselves and their children.""


Tomio Moriguchi, president of Issei Concerns, said the generous grant would enable Issei Concerns to proceed on schedule with its plans to expand the Keiro dining room by some 2,000 square feet to construct a critical-needed multipurpose activity area and also other support facilities, and by so doing vastly improve the quality of care administered to patients.


Moriguchi explained that Issei Concerns will match the $130,000 grant with $30,000 from its general fund and $100,000 it will raise in its capital-improvement drive currently underway.


The Seattle Keiro Nursing Home was opened in October 1976 following an intensive campaign to raise $500,000 in the Nikkei community. It is a 63-bed facility providing nursing care for elderly Japanese in a compatible bilingual and bicultural environment.

Intelligence gathering on Asian community groups doesn't come as news to the former director of the State Commission on Asian American Affairs.


The Examiner reported last month that the Seattle Police Department (SPD) maintained files on numerous organizations and individuals in the International District and Asian community.


Mich Matsudaira, former director of the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs, said, ""I've been aware of police intelligence activities for some time.


""As director . . . I gained possession of a confidential file from the Washington-Oregon Law Enforcement Association."" The Association is a non-profit organization made up primarily of police, vice-detectives and officers from Washington and Oregon.


""The file contained police mug shots of some Chinese youth and other material from police files,"" said Matsudaira. ""Chinese organizations from Seattle, Portland and San Francisco were mentioned.""


Matsudaira said he contacted the Justice Department concerning the file. ""They said it was a non-profit organization and could do what they wanted with the file. I sent copies of the file to (Superior Court Judge) Warren Chan, (King County Council member) Ruby Chow and (State Representative) John Eng, but they didn't do anything about it.""


He said he would attempt to obtain any material about him in Seattle Police Department files.


The Asian groups listed in SPD intelligence files included: the Alaska Cannery Workers Association (the publisher of the International Examiner), Asian Family Affair, Asians For A Fair Media, Chinese For Affirmative Action, Committee For Corrective Action in the International District, International District Youth Council, Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), September 22 Committee, State Commission on Asian American Affairs and the Philippine and Japanese Consulates.


The news of the police spying brought varied responses from those mentioned in SPD files. The consul from Japan was surprised the Japanese Consulate was mentioned. He said, however, ""I'm not in a position to request documents from an American agency."" The Asian Family Affair has already requested its file. ACWA is considering asking for its file. The Philippine Consul refused comment.


Greg Della, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), said that KDP plans to request its files and those of several KDP members as well. ""The disclosure of the spying and harrassment comes as no surprise to us,"" stated Della. ""We were aware of SPD harrassment prior to the 1976 Filipino People's Far West Convention, and also last year when one of our activists, Angel Doneigo, was beaten and interrogated by the police. . . . The SPD apparently regards any attempt by minority groups to organize and improve their lives as a threat that must be spied upon.""


Doug Chin, of Chinese for Affirmative Action, has requested his file. ""I think, for the most part, the surveillance is beyond what is necessary,"" he said. ""We were clearly not involved in criminal activity. This involves people's right to freedom of expression, freedom of speech, that is. It is an intrusion on people's lives, but more importantly, a waste of taxpayers' money.


""The intelligence unit could be eliminated and the police could take a budget cut. . . . It reflects the inefficiency of the SPD. . . . I am outraged that reports are shaky and informants, whoever they are, don't have accurate information, and the police don't bother to check it out.


""It is our right, our duty, to express our opinions and the police are infringing on the democratic process.""

When the Seattle Public Schools opened September 29, about 54,000 students became part of a mandatory desegregation program, with 11,000 being bussed. School District officials are attempting to make Seattle the first major city in the country to desegregate without a court order.


The bussing occurred without incidents of violence that have marred desegregation efforts in other cities such as Boston. According to School District officials, desegregation is a success.


But, according to human relations training experts with the School District, the quality of desegregation leaves much to be desired. The School Administration, they say, is only concerned with moving numbers of bodies around and not with the quality of the education the children will receive at the end of the bus ride.


According to a citizen's committee which has been monitoring the District's desegregation, between fiscal year 1977-78 and 1978-79, human relations training programs suffered a 12 per cent budget decrease.


The nationally-acclaimed Rainbow of Ethnic Cultural Heritage Program recently lost its autonomy when it was placed under the District's multi-ethnic curriculum. Despite a recommendation by the District-Wide Advisory Committee on Desegregation that the program be expanded, the staff was cut from 20 to nine.


""Moberly does not understand what multi-ethnic curriculum is all about,"" said one human relations training expert who asked not to be identified. ""He thinks we all hold hands and walk off into the the sunset.""


Mako Nakagawa, founder and former director of the Rainbow Program, was promoted to principal of Alki Elementary School this year. But observers pointed out that this was part of the move to reduce the effectiveness of the program. At one point, the Rainbow program staff threatened to resign because of Nakagawa's transfer.


According to a multi-ethnic community group letter to School Superintendent David Moberly earlier this month, ""substantial doubt has been raised . . . as to whether our school district is truly committed to the promises that have been made."" The letter, drafted by attorney Ron Mamiya, points out that the School District has increased the responsibilities of the human relations training staff to include crisis-prevention-intervention.


""And further,"" the letter says to Moberly, ""you have chosen to reduce the hours for the (Human Relations Training) workshops and increase the matters to be addressed . . . Such actions would substantially dilute the effectiveness of any program.""


Several desegregation bus drivers said a 32-hour human relations workshop held in late August was important in that it discussed the different cultural backgrounds of the students they would be transporting. Betti Kan, human relations training expert, said, ""The bus drivers were furious others weren't taking the training."" However, there are no plans for follow-up, despite interest in developing a mechanism through which experiences and problems could be shared and critiqued.


Bus monitors (desegregation affiliates) were hired using CETA money. But the temporary status of the CETA positions has led a number of employees to either quit or seek jobs elsewhere. Some observers have commented that the School District, rather than relying on ""soft money,"" should have made them permanent positions so the monitors would have time to get to know parents and students.


School District contingency plans emphasize the control of information to the media as a means of achieving peaceful desegregation. According to the contingency plans, communications with the media are only to be initiated through the Public Information Office. During emergency situations, only certain persons are authorized to make statements to the media.


Critics have pointed out that this prevents the School District administration from having to be accountable to the public.


Also, the Coalition for Quality Integrated Education (CQIE), which has served as a conduit for community concerns about desegregation in the past, has also suffered a drastic reduction in staff. The rumor control center and the In Touch newspaper, the two most visible components of he organization, have both been eliminated from the CQIE functions.


The District has also created other problems by not being fully prepared for desegregation. The 35 elementary schools involved in the desegregation plan suffered a 14 per cent drop from their projected enrollment. The schools not involved in busing experienced a slight increase in enrollment. The District's transfer policy contributed to the discrepancy.


Principals are now being asked to prepare for the loss of assigned teachers, although there are 130 surplused teachers presently unassigned to schools. Present plans are to use these regular teachers as substitutes to save money.


""We are to make classroom adjustments that would allow for the loss of a teacher,"" said one elementary school principal. ""This shifting would actually mean that affected teachers and students will have to start over in building the necessary cooperation.""


One teacher said, ""The District's emphasis has been one of student containment, instead of developing the quality of education provided. Sure, we could maintain order, but the student would lose the necessary individual attention.""


Beacon Hill Elementary School, for example, suffered a decline in projected enrollment. Beacon Hill has been advised that it must surplus one teacher to meet the District's permissible teacher-to-student ratio. Although the Basic Skills Remediation programs are filled to capacity, there are still more students waiting to enroll.


In a letter to Moberly earlier this month, Beacon Hill teachers expressed concern that the greatest burden for meeting desegregation commitments rests with classroom teachers. Parents have stated to the School Administration that the loss of a teacher would be detrimental to the School's achievement of quality multi-racial education.

At the end of August, the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC) may have to close because its CETA funds for its employees will run out.


All CISC employees are funded by Title VIB project employment funds. The money allocated for the 1977-78 budget will end in August, according to Rita Wang, spokesperson for CISC. Discontinuation of CETA funding will result in elimination of staff and services provided to non-English-speaking elderly and new immigrants. The Center, according to Wang, would consider possibly closing.


The CISC board of directors and staff are concerned with obtaining permanent funding to continue and expand the Center's programs. CISC has submitted proposals for Block Grant money, and funds from United Way, CETA, Boeing Employees Good Neighbor Fund (BEGNF), United Presbyterian Church and Self-Development of People. In addition, CISC is organizing fund-raising activities.


The possibility of getting long-term funding is very limited. The Center staff hopes the Block grant and United Way proposals will be successful. However, even of those proposals are accepted, allocation of funds will not occur until January, 1979. Thus, the Center needs at least $25,000 to sustain its operation from August to December.


Of the five proposals submitted by CISC, BEGNF was the first to respond, granting the Center almost $9000. But the BEGNF grant can only be used for office equipment and improvement.


For almost six years, CISC has provided social services to the elderly. The Center has grown from a few volunteers to five full-time staff (one director, one office manager, one administrative assistant and two outreach workers).


During the last nine months, CISC has rendered a total of 6021 services to 3440 clients. The services include:


-- Direct services (clerical, language advocacy, tax, immigration applications, employment placement, information and referral, nutrition program, outreach, translation).


-- Special programs (health education class, emergency procedure class, film shows, parties, physical exercise classes and field trips).


-- Access services (all governmental services).


CISC wants to have more steady, long-term funding so it can provide more professional and comprehensive services. It wants to establish a comprehensive Chinese library, more frequent and organized field trips and excursions and additional educational programs and employment opportunities for both elderly and new immigrants. The Center hopes to increase its services to serve 10,000 clients. All this will not be accomplished if CISC's operation fund ceases at the end of August.


To help provide income for the Center, the board of directors has set up a task force to raise a target $5000. Possible fundraising activities include: benefit dance, raffle, film, street fairs, private donation campaign and bingo. Hopefully other permanent sources can be tapped as well.


During the June Street Fair in the International District, CISC raised almost $150. The elderly helped make dim sum. However, that still leaves the Center far from its target of $5000.


To maintain services for the elderly and new immigrants, CISC needs all the financial support it can get. CISC serves both District and non-District residents.

The purchase of the Bush Hotel is at a standstill as it waits for confirmation of the building's stability, says Ben Woo, chairman of the International District/Chinatown Public Corporation.


The hotel is being considered by the Public Corporation as a site for a community center in the International District. The City of Seattle, under block grants, has allocated $240,000 to acquire it by June 1. Before the purchase, tests must be made on the hotel for stability and to determine if it meets building regulations. If the purchase can't be made by the deadline the money will be revoked and funnelled to other organizations or projects.


Preliminary work by Arai/Jackson/Reyes Architects and Designers was started, which includes a soil and building concrete study. The concrete was found to be weaker than expected and not up to the Seattle City building code.


The Portland Cement Association and its main office in Skokie, Ill., was contracted to perform a structural evaluation. Woo said they were contracted because it utilized computers and could perform an ultrasonic scan on the building.


The study was completed two months ago. The results were to be sent to the Public Corporation a month ago. They are still waiting for it.


Woo said the last call to the Illinois office got them a reply saying the report would reach the Public Corporation by the first Friday of May. By the middle of the second week in May, no report was received. Another call was made and the reply was ""the report or something is in the mail and on its way,"" stated Woo.


When the Public Corporation receives the report; a decision will be made on the purchase of the hotel.

Arlene Oki, special assistant to Mayor Charles Royer, told The Examiner she believes the Mayor will continue his support for the beleaguered International District Special Review Board.


The Board, which recommends policy on land use and physical development of the District, has recently come under fire from Chinese who accuse it of impeding business development. Some Chinese have called for elimination of the Board.


""Charlie (Royer) is on record as supporting the Review Board and we can go on the assumption that support is going to continue,"" Oki said. ""We have proof now with the results of a survey.""


Oki was referring to a questionnaire the District Manager's office sent to organizations in the community, asking each for a list of prioritized issues. The questionnaire, returned by 20 of 23 organizations, also asked whether the Review Board should continue.


District Manager James Mason, at a February 28 meeting between the Mayor and representatives of those organizations, announced that, by a 16-to-one margin, respondents favored continuation of the Review Board.


Oki pointed out that the questionnaire returned by the Chong Wa benevolent Association also favored continuation of the Review Board. Chong Wa representatives had earlier been the ones most vehemently opposed to its continuation. They had initiated a petition campaign, calling for removal of the King Street core from the Board's jurisdiction. The campaign had reportedly resulted in the gathering of 1,200 signatures.


Recently, however, Chong Wa underwent a power struggle, resulting in the nullification of power once held by County Council Representative Ruby Chow. The questionnaire was filled out, apparently, by a group of individuals, including Chong Wa board members.


The Mayor's office had planned to call for formation of a task force to study the Review Board issue and come up with recommendations, but the petitions were never turned in to the Mayor.


""The petitions have never surfaced,"" said Oki. ""Charlie has never seen them. He doesn't really know if they are going to be turned in.""


Oddly, at the February 28 meeting with the Mayor, none of the 40 participants asked the Mayor directly what he planned to do on the Review Board question. Most of the two-hour meeting was devoted to discussion of low-income housing, the top priority of organizations which returned the questionnaire.


The Review Board issue came up indirectly during the meeting when Ben Woo, chairperson of the Chinatown-International District Public Corporation, suggested that the City ""stick a needle into HUD (the Department of Housing and Urban Development)"" to push for low-income housing for the International District.


""Frankly,"" replied Royer, ""in the I.D. I'm wondering what is going to happen. The question is not whether or not there is going to be a cohesive plan, but whether or not we're even going to have a District.""


Royer was referring to the controversy over whether the area is an International District or a Chinatown.


Woo answered, ""You have the same problem Lincoln had.""


Earlier in the meeting, Royer said the purpose of the meeting was to hear from ""all the actors in the District."" Royer said he needed to hear ""from the Bob Santoses to the Abe Lums"" to find out what the District wanted and then ""try to see that the City does not get in the way.""


""If you can tell me what you want and you can all agree on them,"" said Royer, ""we can put together the power of the executive department on getting it.""


According to the questionnaire, the top priorities are, in order: housing, the community center, mini-park, streetscaping, undergrounding utility lines, recreational facilities and a branch library.


Elaine Ko, of the International District Housing Alliance, asked the Mayor if the City recognized the need to provide low-income housing for non-elderly in the District.


Royer said he was putting together a task force on the urban core neighborhoods to advise him on the needs of residents in the area. That problem would be addressed, he said.


Ben Rafanan, director of the International Drop-In Center, said many senior citizens are going to Oregon and other places because there are ""no decent nursing homes that would respond to their needs."" There are many non-English-speaking elderly, said Rafanan, who are isolated in their International District hotels.


He suggested some kind of ""nursing home-housing arrangement."" ""Here,"" he said, ""I'm talking about an income-producing project for the senior citizens, income that can be used for other projects in the District.""


Ron Mamiya, an attorney, told the Mayor that various City departments were taking a ""passive role in advising agencies in the International District."" He suggested that Royer issue a directive to department heads.


""I issue directives,"" said Royer, ""and (the department heads) take it under advisement."" He said the department heads do pretty much what they want to do. There are about ""two dozen strong-headed, independent departments,"" said Royer. He said that, in the transition between Mayors, it takes time to take control. ""I didn't just come in and throw everybody out,"" he remarked.


Ted Choi, of the Chinese Community Service Organization, also said the City should take a more aggressive initiative to communicate with the International District. He pointed out that a large percentage of the residents are non-English-speaking.


Oki said the Mayor plans another meeting with the I.D. organizations because the size of the other meeting prevented discussion of some issues the Mayor had planned for the agenda. Many persons, not invited, attended the meeting.


But, added Oki, ""he was impressed with the size of the crowd of people there and the concern of people for the I.D.""

Dear Mr. Iwamoto:


I am concerned about your article, ""In the Aftermath of Elections: State Legislature,"" published in the November 1978 issue of the International Examiner. Your article was definitely negative and unfair to the 37th district's legislative team (Fleming, Maxie, Eng), but particularly so toward Representative John Eng.


Three sections of your article referring to Rep. Eng need clarification. To be specific:


Paragraph #1: ""Eng also won easily over two opponents of whom he thought so little that he spent only $50 in the entire campaign."" It is true that Rep. Eng won by large margins in the primary and the general. However, it's definitely your opinion, not his, that he thought so little of his opponents. Did you bother to talk to Rep. Eng, his campaign manager or his treasurer as to how his campaign was managed?


Paragraph #2: ""Eng, who faced Republican opposition from John Gilmore, claimed credit for getting the redlining bill through the Legislature, a good position to take in the area which was probably the most redlined area in the State."" The Anti-redlining bill in the 1977 legislative session was a major bill in the Financial Institutions committee. Rep. Eng, chairperson of this committee, spent numerous hours and days drafting the bill, negotiating its terms with his colleagures and the consumer and bank lobbyists, and guiding its presentation and passage in both the House and the Senate. Rep. Eng was most aware of the significance of the redlining problem in his district. Again, did you bother to talk to Rep. Eng about his role in this piece of legislation?


Paragraph #3: ""Fleming, Maxie, and Eng have not been very visible in the community lately. Eng, however, says his door is always open to anyone who wishes to venture down to Olympia. When a politician says his door is always open, be sure to see if he's there before you go -- Olympia is a long way."" I know for a fact that Rep. Eng has not ignored his community. He attended numerous community functions last year such as: the Double 10 celebration/reception at the Rainier Club, the dedication of the Empire Way Tennis Center, the Wing Luke Museum auctions, the Urban League meetings on the Francis North case, the fundraiser for the Total Experience Choir held at MacDonald's on Rainier Ave. South, meetings with the Cherry Hill Coalition at Immaculate Church over the rat control problem and the cleaning-up of Safeway on 23rd, the Asian community interview of the new police chief at Blaine Methodist Church, interviews of the Asian Political Caucus at Quong Tuck restaurant, meeting with the Mt. Baker League of Women Voters, meeting with the Annita T. O'Donnell Democratic Women, and many more. Rep. Eng has a habit of appearing at community functions as a private citizen rather than an elected official. Possibly it would be advantageous for him to have his presence announced to the assembly.


Rep. Eng's long-standing policy is that he will meet with anyone who needs to see him whether it's at their home, his home, a public meeting, a restaurant or wherever and whenever it's most convenient for the constituent. Unfortunately you as well as Peter Rinearson of the Seattle Times didn't understand this. Rinearson quoted John Gilmore who said, ""Accessibility, to John Eng, means he will meet with anyone who drives down to Olympia to see him."" (Seattle Times, Nov. 3, 1978). Some background information to help put Gilmore's statement into perspective is that during the very long 1977 legislative session, John Gilmore, having lost to Rep. Eng in the primary, appeared in Olympia to ask Rep. Eng's help in acquiring additional funding for the University of Washington's E.O.P. program. Rep. Eng honored his opponent's request by working with Gilmore's team in obtaining the needed funds. It appears you prefer to quote a misleading article by Rinearson rather than checking with and quoting the original source, John Eng.


Mr. Iwamoto, I am very disappointed at your negligence as a journalist. I can not believe that an Asian writer for an Asian newspaper would be so unfair to an Asian community member. At least I know that Rinearson took the time to give a short telephone interview on November 2nd to John Eng. You had several opportunities to establish contact for an interview with Rep. Eng -- home phone number listed in the telephone directory, at the Washington Bar Association swearing-in ceremony, the Asian Political Caucus interview at Quong Tuck, through Jack Eng, campaign manager. I believe you owe Rep. Eng an explanation for your biased, unfair, misinformed article; an apology, and a retraction in the next issue of the Examiner. It is my deep opinion that you have examined very little about the accomplishments of the first, elected Asian representative to the State Legislature.


Respectfully yours,


Sandra K. Chock-Eng

The casino, tucked underneath the walk at 2nd and Washington, has the aura of a refurbished bomb shelter. Visible through the dim light are cement floors and bare pipes that wind along the ceiling.


Vicky Kodama, working with the Virginia Educational Film Center (EFC), and her production crew chose the casino as one of their shooting locations. Kodama was in Seattle in early November to write and produce a television documentary which will concentrate on the first wave of Filipino immigrants to the United States in the 1920's and '30's.


Assisting Kodama in this segment of a 6-part series entitled ""Pearls,"" are Frank Nesbitt, director and sound technician, Michael Switzer, cinematographer, and Peter Reniers, assistant cameraman.


When Kodama and her crew visited the casino, many of the regulars shuffled down the stairway and blinked around them in surprise. Bright lights had been set up, and camera and sound equipment handled by the crew were clustered around the table where Al Masigat shot some pool with a friend.


Kodama was first introduced to Al when a Seattle contact sent him a video of the manong who has been a prominent housing activist. ""I loved him!"" said Kodama. She said she was impressed by Al's continual struggle for minority rights.


Her initial research was done through interviews, reading, and mostly ""just getting together with people and sitting down and talking."" She found the elderly were most helpful. ""By 1980 (Filipino Americans) will be the largest (population) of Asian immigrants in America. But despite their numbers, they're the most invisible Asian culture."" Kodama was appalled by the lack of documentation on Filipino Americans. She plans to portray the history through old stills from museums, the National Archives and private collections.


Kodama does not want to ""belabor the discrimination issue"" because it is something that ""every minority has gone through."" She would rather help promote awareness of a unique Asian culture and its history in America. Kodama interviewed Al and focused on his experiences working in the fields and Alaskan canneries. Kodama chose to film him at locations where he works and spends leisure time -- the Drop-In Center, Milwaukee Hotel, Inter*im, International District Community Garden, and the casino.


The casino warmed up to the sounds of laughter and friendly conversation. Mostly manongs were present. Kodama wanted to catch Al in some of his typical moments. She guided other cooperative manongs to the food counter, spacing them along the stools to fill up the scene as the camera focused on Al walking up to sit for a while with his friends. The casino has been Al's hangout since the 1920's.


Kodama was-kept busy helping arrange scenes. Some of the men she had carefully planted along the counter grew impatient for another game of pool and wandered away. Kodama fetched them back. There was much running about, takes and retakes, but Kodama felt in the end that it had been a successful day of shooting.


At the conclusion of this production, funding for ""Pearls"" will run out. PBS television plans to air it next year. Kodama has had experience writing scripts for Pacific Bridges, the EFC series on Asian American history for pre-teens. She also wrote dramatic scripts for Carrascolendas, a Texas television program stressing self-importance for young Chicanos.


Although her current project is her first attempt at producing, she plans to form a production company called EVKO. The name is a combination of the first two letters in the partner's last names, Even and Kodama. Kodama looks forward to her next endeavor with excitement and panic. She compares her position with a baby bird learning to fly. The mother pushes her young out and ""either you fly, or you fall to the ground.""

Ken Mar feeds approximately 50 Chinese elderly each day.


As site manager for the Chinese Nutrition Program, Mar has the responsibility to see that elderly participating in the program get a well balanced diet. Funded under Title VII of the Older Americans Act, the Chinese Nutrition Program is designed to reach Chinese elderly 60 years and older, folks who do not ordinarily have access to elderly-oriented programs.


The program is run at the Eight Immortals Restaurant which caters the daily luncheon. The program had been located at the old Chinese Information and Referral Service. But the program had to be relocated because, Mar said, ""the old place was too dirty, too big, and the elderly had difficulty climbing a long flight of stairs."" The Eight Immortals Restaurant provides two different Chinese dishes, milk, and dessert each day.


Besides providing the Chinese elderly with a well balanced diet, the program also gives the elderly a chance to get together. Mar pointed out that the elderly who participate in the program come from all over the city, from North Seattle to Beacon Hill, as well as the International District. He said, ""A lot of the elderly would probably not get out if it were not for the program. Because of the program, a lot of them hop on buses to get down to the program and see their friends.""


As an additional part of the program. Mar takes the elderly on field trips, serving as tour guide and chaperone. He has taken them to Vancouver, Portland, on the Skagit tours, and into the country by Auburn. Mar claims to have a lot of patience as he tries to keep track of all the Chinese ladies who ""go crazy"" in Vancouver's Chinatown.


The Chinese Nutrition Program is important, Mar says, because it not only provides companionship but is designed to focus attention on the elderly with fixed incomes and limited means. One of the recent additions to the program has been the institution of a food co-op which gives the elderly the opportunity to buy groceries at a 35 per cent discount (whole-sale prices).


Like most social service government programs, the Chinese Nutrition Program lives and dies by the amount of funding it receives. Each year, the program has to fight for its funding or else it will go the way of most social service programs -- cutting back on the budget means cutting back on the services. Ken said, ""It is vitally important to the well-being of the Chinese elderly that this program continue. American society often ignores its elderly, preferring to throw them in rest homes and forgetting about them. Our program gets them out.""


So, if you happen to be in the International District and see a large group of elderly Chinese, look for Kenny Mar. He'll probably be in the middle of it.

Barry Mar is confident ""The Year of the Horse"" will bring him good luck.


That is the name for the restaurant Mar plans to open in October ""contingent upon bank approval,"" he said.


Mar plans to renovate the old Atlas Hotel lobby into a restaurant specializing in continental breakfasts and light lunches of soups, salads and crepes, Mar said. Home-made desserts and expresso coffee are also part of the fare, according to Mar.


""The focus is on using natural and fresh ingredients and de-emphasizing red meat,"" Mar continued.


""I'll be using a format developed by Bob McAfee, who owns the Vitium Capitale Restaurant in the Pike Place Market. Bob McAffee is a genius. His cooking style is very Asian. He cooked in Chinese restaurants for two years. Visually and in terms of taste, the food is great.""


Mcafee is serving as consultant in Mar's restaurant venture.


Mar, working at Vitium for the past year to learn the trade, said, ""I was cook, dishwasher, baker, cashier, waiter, you name it.""


Mar thinks his restaurant, which would be the first of its kind in the District, can succeed ""because we're different"" and ""there is not in the I.D. a good place to have breakfast,"" he said. ""In terms of how the I.D. is developing, there is a market for a nice place to have breakfast."" Also, he continued, ""the I.D. is ready for a non Asian-oriented restaurant.""


Mar, 35, is active in several District community organizations.


He is presently owner and principal consultant of Management and Resources Associates, a consulting service. Earlier, he served three years as director of the Center for Urban Studies.


Mar, enthusiastic about his own business venture, would like to see more young Asians ""take a stab at whatever their thing is, maybe a good bookstore, a good gallery. The District needs more business people like Mich Matsudaira (owner of Mich's Men's Shop) and young professionals like Ron Mamiya,"" he said.


""The District has to be economically viable to survive,"" he added, ""if it wants to grow beyond what it is.""


Mar favors perpetuating small shops and restaurants in the District. ""I don't think the ""ma and pa"" variety are economically feasible but I think it might be on the order of what they are trying to do in Pioneer Square and Union Street in San Francisco,"" he said.


Mar's future plans include expanding his consulting business and ""trying other different food service ideas, none of which I'm going to say for the record,"" he said.


At present, Mar is planning to open for breakfast and lunch Mondays through Saturdays and to open Friday and Saturday nights for dinners by reservation only.

Paul Wada memorial scholarship fund


A memorial scholarship fund has been established in the name of Paul Ronald Wada to benefit outstanding high school students at the University of San Francisco's Upward Bound Program and a graduating Asian law student. These scholarships will be awarded annually in San Francisco.


Paul R. Wada was killed September, 1977 in what has come to be known as the ""Chinatown Massacre."" Paul, son of Mr. and Mrs. Yukio Wada, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and was a law student at the University of San Francisco. He is best remembered for his work helping others and his community. Wada's involvement in the San Francisco Japanese American community stretched from Boy Scout Troop 12 to his part in the founding of Nihonmachi Legal Outreach, a volunteer legal services organization.


An award will be granted to a Bay Area law school graduate who has demonstrated exemplary dedication and commitment to serving minority and low-income communities. This scholarship will go towards the study in preparation for the bar examination. An award will also be given to the most outstanding students in the U.S.F. Upward Bound program.


Contributions may be made to: Paul R. Wada Memorial Scholarship Fund, c/o Christ United Presbyterian Church, 1700 Sutter Street, San Francisco 94115.


Japanese nursing home to expand


Issei Concerns has launched a capital-improvements drive for $100,000 to expand the Seattle Keiro dining room into a multi-purpose room. Tosh Okamoto, fund-raising chairman, said Keiro is filled to capacity, with a waiting list of 20 applicants. This situation has created a serious space problem--overcrowding of the dining room during meals and during activities programs, held in the dining area.


Okamoto pointed out that Keiro has extremely high patient participation in activities, since no patient is completely bedridden. All patients are dressed daily for meals and for various activities.


The original plan of Issei Concerns was to expand Keiro facilities several years after the nursing home was established, but Keiro's rapid utilization by patients makes it imperative to enlarge its facilities now.


Also, part of the $100,000 will be used to install bathrooms in the south wing, which presently lacks such facilities. Okamoto stressed that capital-improvements funds will be used only for this expansion, and will not be applied to the initial campaign to raise $500,000 to establish Keiro, to which $460,000 has been subscribed to date.


Pledges and contributions may be sent to Seattle Keiro, c/o Capital-Improvements Fund, 1700 - 24th Avenue S., Seattle, WA 98144. All contributions are tax-deductible.


Pancake breakfast to benefit childcare center


The Japanese American Citizens League and the Incorporated Asian Student Coalition are sponsoring a pancake breakfast on Sunday, May 21. The breakfast will be held at the Jefferson Recreation Center, 3801 Beacon Avenue South, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Donation is $2 for the general public; children under six and senior citizens are admitted free. Proceeds from this breakfast will go to the Denise Louie Child Care Center and the Incorporated Asian Student Coalition Fund. The Incorporated Asian Student Coalition is comprised of Asian students from various Seattle high schools and middle schools and outlying communities. Its purpose is to provide a constructive outlet for the energies of Asian youth serving the Asian community.


Committee investigates racism charge against judge


On December 6, 1977, Lewis Nomura, a Japanese American attorney for the Seattle-King County Public Defender's Office appeared before Superior Court Judge Horton Smith. Nomura, expecting one of the parties to change a plea, asked the court to postpone his client's trial date.


According to the official court transcript, Judge Smith said, ""But we haven't gotten the plea, have we? No tickee, no washee."" Smith said if a new plea was entered, Nomura could renew his motion.


Then, Smith said, ""But this is today and we are going on today's matters. Tomorrow is Pearl Harbor Day, at least the anniversary of it, and we will wait for tomorrow.""


Nomura filed a motion and affidavit of prejudice against Smith on December 12, which Smith signed on the same day.


So far, investigation into the charges has been completed by a committee of the Superior Court Association. Smith says the committee will make a decision at the end of April. He refused to grant the International Examiner an interview until then.


In a recent Seattle P-I article, Smith said the remarks were not intended to be racial slurs, adding that he is not prejudiced against Asians. He lists evidence that the best legal secretary he ever had is of Japanese descent. He added that he owns a Toyota, a Japanese-built car.


Judge Smith said the remarks are holdovers from the Navy. The P-I article quotes Smith as saying, ""I was in logistics and we used to say 'No tickee, no washee,' whenever we didn't receive a proper requisition form. You've got to have the correct paper and procedure, that's all I was saying.""


Nomura said he was surprised by Judge Smith's remarks but he didn't say anything at the time.


""It was a combination of not knowing what to say and do at the time,"" said Nomura. He also didn't know if he wanted to go on the record.


""I took what I thought was appropriate action,"" said Nomura. Nomura wants Asian attorneys and Asian defenders to be aware of this incident so they can decide if they want to appear before Judge Smith.


The Asian Law Association supports the investigation into the matter. Ron Mamiya, attorney and member of the Association's Steering Committee says he is ""irate"" about this incident. He said a judge is supposed to be unbiased but when a judge makes remarks like Smith's, his ability to be fair becomes questionable.


Judge Smith has sent two letters of apology to Nomura. In the Seattle Sun, Judge Smith said he apologized as soon as he heard Nomura was offended, realizing that people see things differently.


Nomura says he has ""heard of"" other racist remarks made by judges. He doesn't know if any action was taken, noting that it costs both time and money, which is not worth while for some people.

The International District Housing Alliance will launch a campaign against the Union Station study with a community rally and petition drive.


""The Union Station drive should be built up as big as the one for the Domed Stadium because it will affect the community as much,"" said alliance member Elaine Ko.


The Port of Seattle is applying for a $350,000 study to develop the Union Station terminal into an intermodal transportation center. The completed $17 million structure will serve as a terminal for Amtrak and five separate private bus services, and possibly, METRO.


At the October 10 Housing Alliance meeting, residents representing five ID hotels set October 20 as the date for a community rally to gain support against the study. The rally will be held at the Local 37 ILWU hall, at 4:30 p.m.


Alliance members will present signatures collected at the rally to the city council. The council will debate the Union Station application in late October or early November.


""The city can stop this project and the mayor has decided to support the study,"" said Ko. ""So we're aiming next for the city council.""


International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) Director Bob Santos warned the residents of the dangers of the study.


""If you put so much money in a project, it becomes an investment, and pretty soon you can't say no,"" Santos said. ""They will have to go ahead with it, or the taxpayers will get mad.""

What steps has the School District taken to insure that children participating in mandatory bussing safely arrive at their schools? Mike Kozu, community coordinator for the Coalition For Quality Integrated Education (CQIE), has been closely monitoring the situation. He conducted the following interview.


Why did you become a desegregation bus driver?


It's good if you want a part time job and enjoy being around youth. Many bus drivers have children and there is enough flexibility in the schedule so that there's no need for a day care center or anything like that.


What preparation or training did the school district provide to the bus drivers?


We've had to pass the same state requirements that other bus drivers have to go through. We also have different workshops and training sessions in which bus safety and mechanical upkeep is emphasized. What is more useful, though, was the 32-hour human relations workshop that we had.


How effective were the human relations workshops for the bus drivers?


In the past, there has always been neglect that we have to deal with children of different backgrounds. That's why the bus drivers will get so frustrated with the other workshops because the mechanical upkeep of a bus is not our main problem. Our biggest headache is how you relate to all these different children and deal with whatever problems they have on the bus, and at the same time, get the bus to school.


That's why the human relations workshop was good, since many bus drivers learned a lot about the different cultural background of students. For instance, when you are talking to an Asian student, you do not demand for that student to keep looking at you. Especially since that Asian student is probably uncomfortable in maintaining eye contact with someone. I also didn't understand that there were problems between different groups of Asian students. I dealt with a situation wrong, because I though they were all similar.


What could the workshops have emphasized more?


I wanted to discuss more of the actual problems that we face on the bus. For instance, I had this problem driving a bus and going through this affluent, white neighborhood and then go through a relatively poor, black neighborhood. The white students would be talking about their skiing and things like that, so you can get an idea about the background differences. So then, how do you explain to a white student not to say 'nigger' to a black student? Especially since that white student may have heard that black student call another black student 'a nigger.' How do you explain it?


What were the responses of the other bus drivers?


For the most part, people thought that the workshops were pretty good. From what I understand, the approach was better than before. People would complain that the past workshops just tried to lay a 'guilt trip' on them...that they were racist and it was their fault...and then not give any suggestions as to what they can do. It ignored the fact that a racist society conditions individual attitudes and the blame should be on society and not the individual.


Do you have radios or bus monitors?


They took out our radios, saying that it's too expensive, which were put in for last year. I understand that only 25 buses, out of 400, will have radios. And these will be mostly for the high schools.


At this time, there's only enough bus monitors for one fourth of the buses. Supposedly, they are trying with CETA for another 100 bus monitors, but nothing has come through. One thing, though, we're not really given the opportunity to work as a team. There's no time to have any discussion or just to get to know each other. In fact, division of responsibility is emphasized more. Like, the bus driver is responsible for the bus, while the bus monitor is responsible for the students.


What do you feel should be done?


There's always the complaint about the lack of money, but I would like to see some followup in human relations as to the experiences and problems of the bus drivers. We never really see each other since we all have different routes. The human relations workshop was good for an initial step, but we need to know how well it worked in reality.

About 150 persons came to the Northwest Mental Health Conference on Minorities in the Seattle federal building March 17 and 18. These practicing professionals in psychology, nursing, clergy and counseling services came together to assess the status of minorities in mental health and develop existing services.


The Examiner spoke with conference co-chairpersons Julia Bassett, Seattle Mental Health Institute, and Rita Cepeda, University of Washington Community Services.


Bassett said, ""The most positive outcome of the conference was a cadre of people who wished to develop a cross cultural model for this area.""


Cepeda said, ""We have very similar kinds of culturally related problems."" After developing a general model, she said, ""we want to realize the differences and, therefore, establish a basis for setting up social service programs.""


Some conference organizers were: Seattle Indian Health Board, Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), Harborview Mental Health Center, Concilio for the Spanish Speaking in King County and the University of Washington Women's Studies.


The conference keynote speaker was Dr. Juan Ramos, director of special mental health programs for the National Institute of Mental Health. He believes many mental health institutions are often motivated by selfishness and individualism. ""The education that all of us have received are addressed to changing individuals,"" said Ramos. ""Our dominant American values support that particular approach."" He added that emphasis was placed on modernistic values rather than retaining traditionalism. For example, the elderly, traditionally respected for their wisdom, are interpreted as nonfunctional in a modern society.


Ramos also criticized minority mental health commissions which recommend continuation of existing laws. Ramos said he believed ignorance of or apathy in interpreting the laws hinders the progress of educational and mental health programs.


Minority persons noted that the dominant society's values are seen as normal, and those of other cultures are not. Minority values are seen as deviant, usually creating negative self images in minorities.


""We can seek coping mechanisms and define our own mental health normalities, not what the rest of society thinks is right,"" commented Audrey Pambrun, an American Indian counselor. She believes certain cultural aspects must be preserved: religion, ""sense of family,"" and language. She added that alcoholism, high suicide rates, and unemployment were all believed to be precipitated by a cultural clash between the dominant society's values, and those of the minority.


Dennis Katzeek, an Alaskan Native group leader, said self image is particularly important for young children and the elderly. ""The elders were considered the source of wisdom,"" Katzeek said. ""Stories and knowledge were the direction and energy used to direct their lives, giving values, and creating image builders.""


Minority mental health is further complicated by differences within cultures, as well as between cultures. David Okimoto, director of Asian Counseling and Referral Service, says, ""The notion of 'Asian Mental Health' is a political concept.""


The small population in each (Asian) ethnic group along could not justify any amount of funding, he said. ""Asian Mental Health"" becomes useful as a concept by which to seek funds and social change.


But at the service delivery level, ""Asian Mental Health"" breaks down into about eight major groups including Samoans, Laotians, and Vietnamese. There are at least 12 major dialects within the languages alone, he said. Other factors such as date of immigration, geographic origin, various economic status issues must also be considered. Okimoto said it would be more correct to speak of ""Asian communities,"" and not ""the Asian community.""


According to recent immigration statistics, about 80 percent of the large influx of immigrants anticipated will be from Asia by the mid-1980's. With this projection in mind, Okimoto focused on some groups ACRS deals with: recent immigrants, nationalists, and refugees. There is a major difference between recent immigrants and refugees in that immigrants, choosing to come to the U.S., have time to prepare for a new life. They often learned English, and registered into this country. Refugees had little choice: it was a life or death matter. There are often guilt feelings about family and friends left behind.


The largest group of Asians is the American-born Asian and Pacific Islanders. Battered women and children, alcohol and drug abuse are just some of the problems. ""I have no reason to believe that they are in any less of magnitude than within the majority of the population, and actually most are probably in excess,"" commented Okimoto. He also sees potential for self identity conflict in American born Asians and Pacific Islanders.


There are difficulties in administering mental health services, he explained. ""Stereotypes that Asian and Pacific Islanders take care of their own was perhaps somewhat true in the past,"" said Okimoto, ""but at that time, we were more of an agrarian society, we had more support for the extended family network."" There was once, he said, a Chinatown, Japantown, and Manilatown where groups dealt with ""the problems."" ""Unfortunately, what has happened is that the stereotype has continued, but the community support has not necessarily been preserved,"" he said.


""The kind of principles taught in schools of nursing, psychology, social work and psychiatry are, by and large, more impediment than an assistance in terms of providing appropriate services,"" stated Okimoto. ACRS recognizes the need for flexibility in dealing with clients, he said.


Gilberto Rivera, a counselor at the Seattle Mental Health Institute, also supports institutional change. His response was echoed by others at the conference. ""Mental health workers have in the past come from settings in which the needs of minorities have never been confronted,"" he said. ""An almost total revamping of the educational system must be done,"" to improve mental health services for minorities, Rivera added.


The conference participants agreed that a combination of improvements must be made at the educational institutions as well as in existing minority mental health services in the Northwest. Julia Bassett stressed that a consolidation of cultural similarities would provide a model from which alternatives and training programs could be devised. A meeting open to all interested persons will be held April 21 at Seattle Mental Health Institute at 1 p.m.

The farmlands in the Auburn and Kent valleys have long been the source of fresh produce for King County consumers. Now, many ""For Sale"" signs are springing up on the farmlands -- the first steps toward urbanization.


Research studies show that, in the last thirty years, King County farmlands have declined from 165,000 to 55,000 acres. During that time, large fertile farmlands have been replaced by large businesses, including the Boeing Company in Auburn. Presently, only 3 per cent of King County land remains agricultural. These areas include: the Green River Valley and the Enumclaw Plateau in Auburn, the Sammamish Valley, Snoqualmie, and Vashon Island.


In the past, zoning and tax incentives have not proved successful in saving farmlands. Therefore, to retain agricultural lands, King County Executive John Spellman and the King County Council have introduced Proposition One, the Open Space Bond Issue, to protect farmland from urban sprawl.


To accomplish this, an estimated $35 million in taxes would be used to purchase the development rights of farmer's land. Farmers will be paid the difference between the agricultural and market value of the land. The voluntary program means farmers could sell to the county, and thus insure permanent protection of their lands. The other choice is to sell to urban developers.


Once development rights are purchased, the land will be used exclusively for future agriculture. Meanwhile, farmers will continue to raise crops on their own lands.


One election day November 7, Proposition One will need 60 per cent voter approval to pass. If passed, a $40,000 home owner would pay about $4 annually for 20 years.


Dan Carlson, spokesperson for Save Our Local Farmlands Committee, says, ""We have a say in where and what resources are to be retained."" He explained that, in recognizing farmlands as a valuable and natural resource, the quality of life can be preserved for everyone living in King County.


Carlson pointed out that the abundance and availability of fresh produce from King County would eliminate full dependence on produce freighted long distances from other states. He added that local produce is 25 to 50 per cent less expensive that the produce in supermarkets. The loss of the remaining 3 per cent to urban development, Carlson said, is an irreversible step.


Approximately 80 per cent of the farmers are private operators. For most of them, farming is their only source of income. In the Pike Place Market, over half of the farmers' lands would be included in the prime lands desired by businesses. The areas most greatly impacted would be the Green River with a 90 per cent land reduction and the Sammamish Valley with up to 50 per cent reduction. Open greenbelts would no longer grace the countryside.


According to opinion polls, approximately 60 per cent of farmers say they will support Proposition One. However, some farmers have expressed concern over who will farm the land in future years.


Joe Nishimoto, who owns the largest berry farm in the Green River Valley, has farmed all his life. ""I'm for saving the land, but I've got to think about retiring,"" commented Nishimoto. Like many other farmers, he believes developers will give him larger amounts for his land. Since his children are not interested in taking over the business, he says, the business will most likely end with him.


The Primero family, who sell their produce daily in the market, have been farming even longer -- about 50 years. Mrs. Primero says she supports the bond issue, but if no one is there to farm the land, agricultural businesses cannot survive. She believes farming is a very ""healthy way to live.""


The situation of the dairy farmer is different. Currently, King County dairies are the most productive in the nation. Therefore, many dairy farmers have no intention of moving. One dairy farmer said he had to move from California because of urban development. His business is now growing in the Auburn area, and he wants his land to be protected in the future by Proposition One.


For many people like the Primeros, farming is a way of life. The food they raise feeds thousands of King County residents. When asked how she saw the Pike Place's future if local farmlands are bought out, Mrs. Primero replied, ""I don't know... the market will die, I guess.""


Proposition One is an attempt to keep those natural resources within King County alive.

U.S. military bases in the Philippines are ""a dagger in the throat of Philippine sovereignty,"" said a San Francisco City College teacher last month.


Walden Bello, who specializes in Philippine history, spoke at the C.A.M.P. Firehouse to about 50 people, calling for withdrawal of the U.S. bases. Bello is coauthor of Logistics of Repression, a study of the United States support to the Philippines.


Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has demanded one billion dollars from the United States for base rental, in the form of military aid for the next five years.


""Imagine yourself in a country where there are 23 bases of a foreign power covering over 200,000 acres, the most important of which is 50 miles from the capital,"" said Bello. ""Imagine 14,000 foreign troops stationed in these bases, having freedom of motion throughout the countryside.


""Imagine a country where two-thirds of all air travel routes are reserved for this foreign power. Imagine that this power maintains nuclear weapons in these bases over which the host has no control. Imagine that these weapons are moved in and out of the country unrestricted by the host.


""That is the situation of my country, the Philippines. Is it any wonder that in the Philippines and now here in the U.S. there is a movement for the withdrawal of these bases.""


Susan Robb, head of the Seattle Human Rights Coalition, said the Philippine bases are not essential to American national security.


The Asian fleet could either be stationed in Hawaii or Alaska, Robb said. ""U.S. Intercontinental missiles stationed in the U.S. protect our security,"" she added. ""The U.S. bases are used more as spring-boards for intervention in Asia, dating from their use in the Chinese Boxer Rebellion, through their use in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. They have served to allow U.S. policing of the Pacific and have facilitated many costly interventions.""


The forum was sponsored by the Anti-Martial Law Coalition and the Friends of the Filipino People (FFP). FFP is heading up a nationwide effort to withdraw U.S. bases from the Philippines.

Three months ago Dolores Sibonga was appointed to fill the Seattle City Council seat vacated by Phyllis Lamphere. The Examiner talked with Sibonga about her brief term as a council member.


""The city affirmative action policy is the main thing,"" she said. ""It didn't set out to be -- but it just got to me."" She said the mayor's office states that 29 per cent of its appointments to boards and commissions have been minorities and women.


""But boards and commissions don't pay the rent,"" she said. ""The hiring of department heads is the main focus. This is where the power is."" She explained that Don Dudley is the mayor's only such appointment and that other minority and female department heads such as Susan Lane of the Office of Women's Rights are holdovers from the previous administration.


She questions the mayor's procedure in seeking qualified people. Frank Grief, Royer's choice for Director of Cable TV, is an example. Grief was a producer and writer at KOMO-TV. ""I held the same position that he did,"" Sibonga said. ""I know what the job involves. He has no direct experience with cable TV and I know that there are Asians qualified for this position. The mayor didn't bother to search.""


Sibonga has sent a letter to the mayor, proposing amendments in the procedures for confirming appointments of department heads and city boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. In this letter, she further suggests setting up an advisory committee, ""made up of persons with expertise in affirmative action to assist in your efforts to establish programmed recruitment and selection procedures that are realistic, understandable and disseminative to everyone.""


Sibonga feels the Asian community should pressure Royer to instigate an effective affirmative action policy. She urged people not to wait, ""not when Charlie promised the Asian community, a community that heavily supported his election. We should ask him, demand him to make good on his promises.""


About the proposed Union Station transportation terminal, she said, ""The feeling right now among City Council members is: 'why not have a study?'"" She feels, however, the Council probably can be persuaded to vote against the project. ""The majority of the Council feels the International District is a good mesh of a residential and commercial interests,"" she said. ""But it will take organized community pressure to persuade them.""


She feels good about her short term in office. ""The people on the City Council are an okay bunch."" She plans to go back to the State Human Rights Commission now that her term on the council is over. ""John Miller advised me not to make any hasty decisions whether to run for public office. He said to step back and wait a while before deciding.""


She feels her major work on the Council has been on the issue of affirmative action, working to revise the city personnel ordinance to place more emphasis on merit, and revising the city budget to provide more direct services and less unnecessary consultants and studies.


Sibonga hopes the Council will continue to work on these issues. ""It's important that someone be here. I'm not sure it would be me,"" she said.

There are approximately 12 to 13 Asian Americans incarcerated in the Washington State Reformatory at Monroe, Washington.


Most are in their twenties. They come from a variety of backgrounds: immigrants to native born, rural to big city.


In the ""joints,"" inmates cannot make it unless they belong to some group. For many of the Asians in the reformatory, it was brought home early that their skin color set them apart from the other inmates. The Asians have bonded to form an organization, the Asian Alliance.


Some of the Asians have discovered their ethnicity for the first time since they were sent up.


According to Deborah Uno, advisor at Seattle Central Community College, it is important that the Asian inmates establish some positive outside contacts with the Asian community. When it comes time for one of these inmates to be released, outside support will be needed. The inmates themselves admit it's very easy to be submerged in the sub-culture of the reformatory. The importance of keeping contact with the Asian community is measured in terms of maintaining the Asian identity.


Asian inmates need something positive to look forward to. Living conditions at the reformatory are ""like a zoo."" Nine hundred inmates are housed in a facility built to accommodate 600. Many days are spent just ""passing the time."" Inmates say life is monotonous. The temptation to get into trouble is great. Minority inmates, comprising approximately one-third of the resident population, and white inmates maintain an uneasy truce, provided people stay in their respective territories. Occasionally, a power play is made for table space in the crowded cafeteria.


""The worst thing about this place is that it's too old and it's too filthy,"" one inmate said. ""You can't keep your place clean. You could sweep up but because the place is so dusty, it would dirty in 15 minutes. Most people don't care.""


Prison life is ghetto life. Overcrowded conditions lead to arguing and fighting. The cafeteria is too small to allow everyone to eat at one time. Therefore, the prison population must eat in shifts. People have 30 minutes to eat if they are lucky. The last shift gets 15 minutes to eat under the well-regimented time schedule. The inmates claim the food served isn't worth the hassle. Worms have been found in the salad. Once a cook was found stirring fried rice with a dust pan, caked with the scraps of months-old meals.


Most minority inmates have full-time sponsors, generally community service organizations which visit the inmates and provide a necessary link to their communities. Except the Asian inmates. They are the only minority group at the reformatory which does not have regular full-time sponsors. According to these inmates, they need to relate and communicate with people who can understand the situation they are in. They are not necessarily looking for sympathy but are reaching out for support.


Many of the inmates would like to get involved with the Asian community. Inter-relating with the community is important if they are going to make it on the outside. But before they can relate to the Asian community, they need to know what's happening. They need Asian community organizations and people who can provide arts and crafts, films, speakers and Asian foods.


The main thing the Asian inmates wish to point out is that there are Asian Americans in the reformatory. They feel very much a part of the Asian community. But their only contact with Asians, except for a family, friends, and some dedicated volunteers, is with themselves. Regardless of what they did or whether they deserve to be where they are, they need some positive community support. It's tough enough making it with the support of the Asian community, let alone making it without the community.

The Pike Place Market was not very busy at seven o'clock Saturday morning. A few old men shuffled along the aisles, lugging shopping bags; some of the farmers had arrived and were unloading produce from their trucks. Only at the vegetable stall near the main entrance was there scurrying and purposeful movement. Coffee in styrofoam cups and a box of donuts sat untouched on a bench, while the Rebop crew checked over and set up film equipment and arranged lighting.


As more merchants arrived, the market seemed to wake up. People called to each other from opposite ends of the stalls. By this time, the crew was set to go. The Primera family drove up in their truck. They come in from Auburn each morning with vegetables from their six acre farm to sell at the Market. Mr. Primera's two teenaged daughters had been chosen by the Rebop team as subjects in a short documentary film. Jim Yee and his co-worker, Barbara Selwyn, had spotted the two while visiting the Market a week ago. Unsure how he might approach them, Jim decided to purchase a couple pounds of carrots from them. He was attracted by the apparent spark in their personalities, and their openness.


Cameraman Dasal Banks, an agile artist, leapt back and forth getting the Primeras on film as they unloaded chives, lettuce and turnips from their truck. A young woman walked by on her way to her stall and called out to Mr. Primera. ""Hey, Primo! You gonna go dancin'?""


""Yeah!"" His face lit up.


""You got your hiking boots on?""


They both laughed.


Jim Yee groaned: the camera was not running. It was this kind of spontaneous interaction they wanted on film. Working with a flexible format, such interaction was either picked up or missed, but continuous, on-going action allowed little time to bemoan what was missed.


Dasal's camera was in motion again, focusing on a customer, zooming along rows of fresh, plump vegetables.


Grasping a wooden 'paddle,' Mr. Primera swished turnips around in a metal tub of water using a rocking and twisting motion. ""Best way to wash turnips,"" he said. ""This is the farmer's invention."" He laughed. ""I even wash my clothes this way!""


Primera has been in the U.S. for at least 50 years, managing a small farm in the Auburn area. He went back to his homeland in the Philippines once to marry. They returned to carry on the farm work. Jim Yee realized Primera's lifestyle, that of a small truck farmer, is slowly dying out as large agribusinesses move onto the land. This uniqueness, the Rebop team decided to document in one of their films. The team spent two days out on the Primera farm, filming the two sisters as they helped plant pea seedings in the rain. Jim quickly noticed that there was ""a lot of love in the family and pride in being farmers.""


Hopefully, editing in Boston will produce a sensitive film segment portraying two Filipino American girls who are part of a way of life that may eventually fade.


For those who don't mind waking up at 9:30 on Saturday mornings, it would be worthwhile to tune to Channel 9 to catch the Rebop series, especially this autumn, when the films taken of Seattle Asian Americans are scheduled to air.

WASHINGTON, D.C.--The Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Educational Subcommittee in the House of Representatives finished amending the Bilingual Education Act last month. The Subcommittee increased funds for bilingual programs, but retained the Administration's amendment to limit federal funding of local projects to five-year periods.


The full Education and Labor Committee is expected to act on the bill before sending it to the floor of the House for more debate, further amendments, and eventual passage of the bill. There are no indications what changes will be made in the full Committee and on the floor.


An amendment by Rep. Dale Kildee (D-MI) was accepted by the Subcommittee this week to increase authorized funding levels beginning at $200 million in 1979 and increasing to $400 million in 1983. Current authorization stands at $135 million. The Carter Administration had proposed a level of $150 million for 1979.


Delegate Baltasar Corrada (D-Puerto Rico) submitted an amendment to eliminate the Administration's amendments which would limit federal funding of local programs to five years. Corrada argued that states and local districts would not be prepared to assume costs of the programs after the five-year limit. The Corrada amendment was defeated, but a compromise by Rep. Paul Simon (D-IL), which mandates the U.S. Commissioner of Education to waive the time limit under several circumstances, was accepted.


Corrada is planning to continue to fight to have the time limit removed. The Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA) has also opposed the time limit. In its position paper, OCA agreed with the need to have states and local districts eventually assume costs of the programs, but stressed that states and local districts would not be able to assume costs after five years and would more likely drop or drastically reduce their programs.


Other amendments accepted by the Subcommittee include:


Limiting the number of English-speaking children in the programs to 40 percent.


Allowing for the centralization of teacher training, curriculum development, research, and administration while serving children in their own schools in situations where state and local practices would segregate children.


Giving local districts more flexibility in the amount of a grant used for training activities.


Placing emphasis on bilingual education services in localities with a large influx of language-handicapped children.


Defining English proficiency as when a student can speak, read, write, and understand English at a level comparable to other children at that age and grade level.

The Asian Legal Association, comprised of Asian American lawyers, law graduates, and law students, is concerned with a growing number of minority law school graduates failing the bar examination. Results of recent bar exams show white applicants have been passing at about 66 to 75 per cent rate while minority applicants are passing at a rate of less than 50 per cent. This means at least two out of three whites are passing, while about half of the minority applicants pass. Based on unofficial statistics, results for the 1977 July bar exam indicated a 50 per cent pass rate for Asian applicants. The problems of passing the bar exam are affecting all non-white communities.


The number of minorities flunking the bar increases each year and demands a re-examination either of the law school or the bar exam.


Before the era of affirmative action, law schools were 95 per cent white and, consequently, so was the legal profession. Due largely to affirmative action, minority admissions programs were instituted to bring qualified minority students into the law schools. As a result, minority students began to attend law school in greater numbers.


An example: the total number of Asian Americans who graduated from the University of Washington Law School before 1970 numbered less than ten. In contrast, the entering class for 1977-1978 contained 15 Asian law students.


The obvious question is whether law schools, by admitting more minority students, are lowering their academic standards. Based on our experiences as law students and practitioners, we can say that once admitted into law school, the work load was no different for white students than it was for minorities. Everyone had to attain a cetain standard of performance. Minority admissions programs were just a means of access to the law school.


Minority students were and are not given any leeway in meeting a standard level of competence in studying law. The problem does not lie with the law school unless law school officials declare they are graduating incompetent people who lack the skills necessary to practice law.


Some people have criticized use of the bar exam as a means of screening the unqualified from the qualified. One criticism is that the bar exam has no particular relevance to the everyday practice of law. For example, lawyers do not sit all day and write answers to problems without benefit of legal materials. If a lawyer doesn't know a particular legal point, that person can research the problem. The bar exam does not test an applicant's legal research skills. Another example is negotiation skills. The legal profession is founded on attorneys representing clients in an adversary setting: that is, each attorney handles the case against a competitor. As lawyers, we can say very few cases ever go as far as a trial; most are settled out of court. The bar exam doesn't test negotiation skills.


In particular reference to the pass rate of minorities, some have criticized the bar exam as culturally biased. Requests have been made to Washington State Bar Association to have the bar exam professionally validated. The Bar Association hasn't taken any action.


The response of the Bar Association is that the bar exam is the only practical means of screening unqualified applicants from competent applicants. Whether that is true can be debated, but two things are certain. First, many people are dissatisfied with the quality of attorneys who have passed the bar, but can't adequately represent their interests. Second, minority communities continue to be underrepresented in legal profession.


The Bakke decision could have a damaging effect on future legal representation in our communities. If the charge of ""reverse discrimination"" is upheld against ""affirmative action,"" the call for minority professionals won't be answered. The Asian Law Association supports the effort to reverse the Bakke decision.

Philippine immigrant wins SOIC award


Julieta Jorge Patawaran, a recent immigrant to the United States from the Philippines, last month received the Seattle/Opportunities Industrialization Center (SOIC) Edwin O. Stallworth Employee Award.


She received three month training in office skills at SOIC as well as financial assistance, and she now works for the Port of Seattle where she recently received a promotion.


Accepting the award at an appreciation banquet at the Washington Plaza Hotel, she said, ""For me, this award is a representative of my efforts to assimilate new skills by the way of the training offered by Seattle/OIC, and it is my badge of self-confidence toward better career development.""


Filipino community starts membership drive


The Filipino Community of Seattle, Inc. (FCSI) last month began a membership drive to ensure broader community participation when the FCSI elects new leadership in the January elections.


David Della, chairperson of the membership drive committee, said, ""The goal of this drive is to lay the foundation to open up the FCSI by encouraging and drawing in the active support of the broader Filipino community by going out into the largely unorganized sectors of youth, students, elderly and recent immigrants.""


Several community people and council members have remarked that there are many relevant questions the FCSI should take up besides just sponsoring cultural and social events.


""If the present leaders of the FCSI would open the center to new ideas and insure community-wide input, then, in turn, the community would give the FCSI their confidence and support,"" remarked an active council member.


Council members have also charged that decisions are not made democratically with mass participation.


Recently, however, new leadership has emerged from council members such as Della, Mrs. Ade Domingo, Mrs. Zenaida Guerzon, Mrs. R. Farinas and Mrs. I Pagulayan. These members helped plan the third annual Philippine National Day celebration which attracted 1,500 to the Filipino Community Center.

New 100-unit housing project goes up


A groundbreaking ceremony was held early this month to celebrate the new 100-unit low-income housing project being built by Security Pacific at Maynard Ave. and S. Weller.


The project, International House, will receive Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 program funds to subsidize rent payments by low-income tenants.


The project was first proposed in June, 1976. It received the strong endorsement of the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) and the International District Housing Alliance. According to the Housing Alliance, there are 352 low-income persons signed up for the International House and 293 persons signed up for the Century Construction project being built on Sixth and Main St.


Mayor Charles Royer, who participated in the October 11 groundbreaking, also pointed out that HUD has given conditional approval to the International District's application to become a Neighborhood Strategy Area (NSA). Under the NSA proposal, 17 vacant apartment buildings would be rehabilitated as low-income and market-rate housing.


Royer said the International District ""is healthy"" and ""obviously not on the ropes"" as some had predicted it would be when the Domed Stadium was constructed near the District.


But, Bob Santos, director of Inter-Im, said at the groundbreaking, that the Port of Seattle's proposed transportation terminal on the west boundary of the District threatens the development of housing.


The construction of International House, he said, required a total effort from HUD, the community and the city. ""We want these groups to fight any unnecessary and unwanted development in the District,"" Santos said in reference to the transportation terminal.


The International House will have both commercial and residential space. Four thousand five hundred square feet of the ground floor will be used for small shops. The remaining seven floors will be one-bedroom apartments.


Each apartment will include a living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom. There will be communal recreation and crafts rooms, a laundry room and lounges. There will be provisions for handicapped tenants.

Prostitution has increased significantly in the past six months in the downtown area. The International District has gotten the bulk of it.


There has been an increase in reported muggings and thefts. The culminating event was the murder of a longtime elderly resident in the Downtowner Apartments. The suspects charged with his murder and robbery are a pimp and a prostitute.


Robert Santos, executive director of International District Improvement Association, has expressed concern over the increased vice activities to the Seattle Police Department on numerous occasions. The police have responded and the prostitutes have been less visible the past three weeks.


""Everyone is concerned about the issue, not necessarily the profession (prostitution) but the attitudes of the people involved in the prostitution,"" said Santos.


""The 'johns' are hustling every woman in the area, many who are legitimate employees of the area. We don't like to see them around and sometimes you get retaliation which could lead to physical violence.""


Jon Nakagawara, director of the International District Health Clinic, stated in a letter to the police department that some of his female nurses expressed concern for their physical safety when they had to conduct outreach in the hotels.


Donnie Chin, International District Emergency Center director, said, ""The prostitutes will always be here. People were just seeing them more the past few months. The out-of-state pimps from California and Oregon is one of the main problems.


""They would carry guns and be acting 'bad,' use abusive language with us and people on the street, generally hassling everyone. The 'johns' be coming into the area with the attitude of looking for a woman. They would be driving dangerously, making abrupt stops, almost running the residents over because they're not watching where they're going. Sometimes they would circle the block 20 to 30 times, increasing pollution.""


There have been cases where the customers or 'johns' would just follow a woman around, thinking she was a prostitute until the woman would call the police to stop the harassment.


The prostitutes have been able to flourish in this area because of the tolerance of certain businesses. Certain hotels and restaurants allow the prostitutes to conduct their business around and in their establishments.


Some of the prostitutes migrated from Pike Street. Many of them are runaways from out of town. Very few of them are over 18 years old; the majority are around junior high school age.


With the prostitutes less visible, Donnie Chin stated, ""The crimes are still visible. There has been no decrease, they're just not reported.""


The prostitutes will stay less visible as long as the police pay attention to the District. Concerned community people, at a meeting with Administrative Assistant to the Police Chief, Cary Parkes, stated that at times they wouldn't see a police around for long periods. McDonald Sullivan, new executive director of the Chinatown/International District Public Corporatioin, stated that he was down in the area for one week at different hours of the night and he didn't see any foot patrol. The police department said there were foot patrols and squad cars assigned to the area.


In the past months, residents and employees of the area have reported some increase in visibility of the foot patrol.


With the theory of supply and demand, prostitution will always be here. ""The primary residents in the area are single males,"" said Santos. ""There is that need for 'companionship.' We're not that opposed to the profession; just the attitudes and crimes that the people bring with them.""

Seattle University Professor Don Foran recently returned from a three-week tour of Kenya, where he learned about the infant malnutrition often resulting from formula feeding. He speaks about his observations at a public forum on Wednesday, October 25, 7:30 pm at the Seattle University Library. The forum also will include a showing of the recent CBS Reports program on this issue ""Into the Mouths of Babes.""


The talk is sponsored by Seattle INFACT, the local chapter of a national organization which has accused several companies of unethically promoting infant formula in developing countries. According to INFACT, health conditions in these countries, such as the lack of clean water, make formula feeding impractical and dangerous. INFACT believes that breastfeeding is a superior method and has called for an immediate stop to all promotion of infant formulas in these countries. For more information about the program, contact INFACT at the American Friends Service Committee office, 632-0500.

""Kobe Park will improve in a year or so,"" predicts master gardener Jack Takayama, newly appointed caretaker of Seattle's Japanese American park. Kobe Park is situated at the top of South Washington Street in the International District.


Takayama's optimism is not mere braggadoccio. It is founded on more than a half century of experience in designing, building and maintaining or nate Japanese cultural gardens.


""I enjoy planting and pruning trees,"" says Takayama who lives in International Terrace.


This perfect blending of work and hobby began in 1928 when Takayama, then a young B.S. Architecture graduate, taught himself Japanese landscape gardening by reading books and working for an older Japanese gardener. Since then he has pursued this love with devotion and an amiable sense of humor.


Starting with his own home garden, he has built more than 30 private family gardens. He is mindful of the unique stories each garden tells of the family it represents.


But surprisingly for Takayama, a humble and unassuming artist, it is the public garden in the Yakima Area Arboretum which tells the story of his life. He designed and built it in 1976; it is the largest and most meaningful garden he has built -- the ""masterpiece of his career.""


Responding to the invitation of the Yakima Arboretum Society to come out of retirement to design the garden, Takayama discovered upon inspection of the site that it was the same ground he tilled as a 16-year old vegetable gardener more than six decades ago.


The eldest of three boys, he left his brothers in Japan in 1918 to join his mother who came in 1916 and his father who arrived with several young Japanese in 1902. He and his father worked in many Japanese-owned gardens until they had their own. Takayama went to high school in Wapato and college in Portland. He was happily married for forty-three years until his wife's death in 1973. He has three children and four grandchildren.


He moved to Seattle from Yakima after his retirement in 1975. But just as he felt delighted and honored when asked to come out to build the garden in the Yakima Area Arboretum so is he enthusiastically responding to the mammoth task of maintaining Seattle's Kobe Park.


The care of Kobe Park is certainly a challenge to Takayama. Newly converted from a jungle of blackberry briers and weeds, the 1.4 acre terrace park promises to tell a unique story of its own -- starting with its Mt. Fuji cherry trees, Yukimidor lantern, several bases for Oriental lighting, and lines of benches.


In the hands of master gardener Jack Takayama, it will inevitably unfold the story of the community it represents and become a source of joy and pride for all Seattleites.

On March 3, 1978, Diane Wong did something she had been considering doing for a while. She quit her job. Wong did not regret relinquishing her position as staff attorney; she felt she had ""burned out"" her energy providing legal services for cases that seemed to have little or no social relevance. ""I felt there were better ways to spend my time,"" said Wong.


Back in Spring of 1976, she was fresh out of Boston University's law school. She carried good memories of work in Boston's Chinatown, where she had assisted in setting up a legal service program to augment the outreach program.


Job hunting in Seattle, Wong discovered prejudices in the legal profession. Private law firms, she said, are still very conservative, comprised mostly of young, white, male attorneys. ""They (non-minority, potential employers for legal firms) view Asians as non-aggressive,"" she said, and thus, it is the Asian who loses out when it comes to hiring.


In August, 1976, Wong found a job with Evergreen Legal Services, where she specialized in immigration cases. This statewide organization provides legal services for those who otherwise could not afford them. Frustration began to build when she realized that the ultimate emphasis was on the number of cases she could handle within a certain amount of time. She said she would rather fight for social change than restitution for $375 damage to someone's automobile.


When Wong worked on behalf of garment workers, she began to understand her own need to focus on problems which affected large numbers of Asians. However, she found that her routine case load took up much of the time and energy she wanted to spend with the garment workers. She felt she had to reassess the value of her job.


Wong wants to find a job that enables her to fill a relevant role within the Asian community, widening her scope of legal assistance, her impact on the community. But she said she realizes she must earn a living and needs some kind of monetary compensation for her services. Wong has found it difficult to compromise these two needs.


Although she has been trying to relax between jobs, Wong has kept very busy; she attends meetings for the Asian Counseling and Referral Service and the Housing Alliance; and spends one day a week at Inter-Im, giving free legal counsel.


Wong said there are not enough Asian attorneys willing (or able) to practice for the low-income population. There is also a need, she said, for bilingual, bi-cultural attorneys. Wong said there are more Asians pursuing an education in law, but added that it is still not easy to get a job, or deal with co-workers and clients once they are practicing. As an Asian woman, Wong said, she was stereotyped as a ""submissive"" Asian, as well as an ""incompetent"" woman. Wong cited the condescending manner of non-minority attorneys and a client who demanded to see her diploma upon hearing she was his attorney.


""I didn't like having to fight two battles at one time,"" Wong said, ""but I guess it's something I'll have to do for the rest of my life.""


Wong said she prefers to work with other Asians because ""they (more readily) accept me for what I am."" She noted that I.D. co-workers and agencies work cooperatively.


Ideally, she would like to set up practice in the International District, using grants from the government and private industry so she could serve the low income population. She would like to be in a position where she could affect public policy planning.


Wong said she would like to see local I.D. agencies organize to jointly hire a ""legislative consultant"" as a contact in Olympia. This consultant would propose legislation and collect and disseminate information on bills.


Wong is not about to let the persistent stereotypes of Asians and women slow her down. She only hopes these frustrating drawbacks don't discourage other Asians, especially Asian women, from entering the field of law.

What if you placed cameras on kids's shoulders and viewed the world as they saw it?


You'll find out on a special television series now being produced in the Bay Area. Six, half-hour programs, to be aired nationally, will give a rare inside view of what it's like growing up Chinese American. The series will present this story as if the children themselves were behind the cameras, recording their activities, showing their own view of things. It's designed for eight to 11-year-olds.


The children's series, funded by an HEW grant and scheduled for production over a year, will be the work of the Children's Television Project, a newly formed community based production group, sponsored jointly by The Association of Chinese Teachers (TACT) and Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA). TACT and CAA have long experience and close involvement in various community projects. Having previously developed educational materials, films and television programs, TACT and CAA also submitted a proposal for the present children's television series. This ranked among the top three in a national competition for HEW funding and won a grant under the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA).


Directing the project is Producer/director Loni Ding, who, through many years of association with KQED's Open Studio, has produced several hundred television programs with Bay Area groups, presenting a wide array of interests and concerns from the groups' unique perspectives. Nationally, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has aired two programs produced, directed and written by Ding: How We Got Here: The Chinese, and 600 Millennia: China's History Unearthed, a 90-minute documentary on the archaelogical exhibit from the People's Republic of China, which toured San Francisco in 1975.


For the current Children's Television Project, the staff, who will also function as the technical crew, are: Myron Chan, Michael Chin, Sara Chin, Phil Toy and Dean Wong.


Dr. Dave Berkman, HEW program officer for ESAA-TV in Washington, said the project is ""very valuable insofar as it meets the need of Chinese American youngsters, enhancing their ethnic identity and sense of self-worth. It also has value in informing non-Chinese viewers of Chinese contributions to this country. The shows, using a varied format--mini-documentary, mini-drama, animation and music--will be ""fast-moving and fast-paced, which should appeal to all children.""


The efforts of many people in the community--teachers, community workers, parents and children--have been invaluable in getting the project started. As production continues in the coming year, the television crew (expected to pop up almost anywhere), welcome on-going community participation and seek everyone's cooperation to bring into being this very special series.

""Multi-cultural education is not just singing some songs or tasting somebody else's food,"" said Mako Nakagawa, ""That's really ripping off someone's culture.""


Nakagawa is the founder and former director of the Seattle School District's Ethnic Cultural Heritage Program. This fall, she is the principal of Alki Elementary School in West Seattle.


""There's nothing wrong with learning a song, nothing wrong with learning how to use chopsticks, but how it's done is important to us,"" said Nakagawa.


The program began as a Japanese one, expanding to an Asian program and then finally to the multi-cultural program.


""Essentially we have two things that we try to teach everyone,"" said Nakagawa. ""One is to take pride in who you are. That's very important to me because when I was going to school, I never had a chance to have anybody to model after or tell that I was really beautiful to be who I am -- Japanese-American -- proud to be who I am, my culture and my collective group.""


""On the other side, respect people who are different without threat or envy. Those are our two major goals all the time.""


The future of the program depends on the funding. So far, the District funding was not secured yet and the federal funding was up in the air still.


""I had an assistant manager and I hope he'll be the one to carry on the program after I'm gone,"" said Nakagawa. ""T.J. Vasser, he's a good person. I think he'll do a good job.""


""May Sasaki, who's been with the program a long time, was planning to quit the same day as me but she decided to stay on. She's a key person.""


""I think she's more important than me. If she decides to go, it'll be pretty crippled.""


""I applied for the principalship,"" said Nakagawa, ""You made it sound like I was pushed over there. I had a choice, I applied for it. I was lucky I was chosen for it.


""I decided which was a better shop. I've been with it for eight years so I thought, well, maybe the program would have a better chance without me.


""My husband was laughing at me, 'You think everything will kaput without you, but it'll get better.'


""There were some problems as to how I thought the program should be run from my perspective.


""We're trying to promote a multi-ethnic program that's tied with human relations skill building so that I'll learn how to deal with myself and how to deal better with other people.


""We looked at things that I disapproved of,"" said Nakagawa, ""such as Japanese Week. I'm Japanese-American all year round. Japanese Week bugged me.


""They'll have little dances and things that meant well but they tend to promote the stereotype instead. We looked at that and we said we don't want kids to learn how to use chopsticks. That doesn't mean anything to me.


""We're always trying to teach something ethnic, something that has a moralistic, humanistic lesson to it.""


An example of an activity used in the program is the daruma doll. The doll has no feet, arms or eyes. But what he has is more important than what he doesn't have. No matter how many times he is pushed down, he always comes back up.


""There's a saying,"" said Nakagawa. ""Seven times I may go down, eight times I'll come up. In other words, I'll always come up one more time than I'll go down.""


This exercise is from the Rainbow Activities book let put together by the staff of the Ethnic Cultural Heritage Program.


Another source of material for teachers is the Rainbow ABC's. It is a packet of alphabet cards with pictures and sayings such as ""A is for Americans, five colors strong; A is for America, where we all belong.""


Some material was adopted from other sources and some is original.


""I think the whole emphasis will be in developing more materials, training teachers, etc. so people of good will can teach it,"" said Nakagawa.


""I would like to see multi-cultural education mandatory, but before we do that, we have to have a good multi-cultural curriculum and that's in various stages of development.""


Workshops have thus far been voluntary although Nakagawa said some principals have put pressure on their teachers to attend. The workshops are held during the regular school day.


The program last year received a state award from the Washington Education Association for human relations curriculum training. This year, the program has a good chance of getting state validation, says Nakagawa. The next step after that would be to get national validation so the program would be available to everybody in the country.

Recently, publicity on the Milwaukee Hotel has focused on negotiations between the hotel owners and the International District Housing Alliance (IDHA) and Inter*Im. IDHA and Inter*Im, presently managing the hotel, want to obtain ownership of the hotel so it can be retained as housing and eventually be renovated.


But on another, equally critical front, community volunteers and hotel tenants have been keeping the hotel open by working as a 24-hour-a-day firewatch crew. This month is the first anniversary of firewatch at the Milwaukee.


It was a year ago that the community, seeing the potential spectacle of another hotel closing in the housing-scarce International District, came forth to correct numerous fire code violations in the old hotel, hauling away tons of debris and making numerous repairs. At that time, the Milwaukee Hotel made the news; the International District was put on the city's map.


Today the work still goes on, pushed forward by dedicated volunteers. Fire-watch goes on.


Tenants await installation of a fire alarm system which would make fire-watch by volunteers no longer necessary. Until then, at all hours of the day, volunteers, taking two- and four-hour shifts, staff the hotel office and make periodic rounds through the creaky halls of the hotel to check for hints of smoke or fire. This early warning system insures that, in case of fire, tenants can be safely evacuated and the fire department can be notified shortly after trouble is detected.


Beyond looking for signs of fire, the volunteers also help call for assistance when they see tenants in need of medical attention; they help repair leaky roofs, change and fix lights; they scrape walls and paint rooms. Recently a group of them helped move a pile of junk out of the basement.


Most of the time, it is pretty uneventful at the Milwaukee. The trick is how not to get bored sitting in the hotel office on the first floor. The trick is to creatively occupy time until the next patrol of the halls.


Some read from a choice of magazines stacked on the counter. Everything from U.S. News and World Report to the International Examiner. Some, if they are not on the graveyard shift, watch television. Some, not averse to poor sound quality, listen to the radio. Some snack. Some write miscellaneous thoughts in the Milwaukee Hotel journal, a diary found in the hotel back in May. Some people gather to play mah-jong.


""I look out the window to see the tourists across the street at Tai Tung,"" said one volunteer.


""I look for fires,"" said another.


Kudos to those suffering behind the scenes to keep the Milwaukee Hotel open, the firewatch volunteers:


Dave Haugen, Dan Rounds, Kenny Mar, Susie Chin, Gene Viernes, Sissy Asis, Bob Santos, Andy Mizuki, Paul Kurose, Gary Iwamoto, Kathy Kozu, Rick Furukawa, Richard Huie, Maxine Chan, Joe Kitamura, Dicky Mar, Dale Borgeson, Mike Kozu, Steve Goon, Mel Inouye, Donnie Chin, Lorraine Sako, Leonard Hayashida, Tim Otani, Jack Dosch, Man Chan, and Doralinn Jung.

Larry Y. Matsuda said he grew up in a bilingual home. This background well equips Matsuda to be the new coordinator of bilingual programs for the Seattle School District.


He was a language arts teacher in the Seattle Public Schools from 1968 to 1971, counselor at the University of Washington and staff assistant in the Office of Minority Affairs. Most recently he was program administrator - for Asian American programs in the office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.


Matsuda has a bachelors degree in education, a masters degree in educational administration, and is a doctoral candidate in higher education at the University of Washington. Matsuda said he somehow burned the candle at both ends by attending school and working full-time. ""All I have to do is write my dissertation ... somehow,"" he said.


Matsuda said his home life was ""somewhat bilingual."" Japanese and English words were intermixed, but he got used to it. ""My brother just spoke Japanese, so he had a harder time of it,"" said Matsuda. The Asian philosophy is that politeness requires one to first refuse an offering, he said. But the Western way is that ""you either accept or refuse something because no one offers twice,"" said Matsuda. Thus, he explained, there is some conflict between Asian teachings and the Western way of life.


""I am concerned with policy procedure,"" Matsuda said of his new position. ""Right now I am working on examining the tutorial situation ... mostly the hiring of part-time tutors. I would like more community involvement ... such as a family member (working as a tutor). There is some financial renumeration."" Gathering more community involvement in the bilingual programs is just one of his innovative goals.


The Seattle Public Schools will begin desegregation this month. The bilingual program coordinator will try to establish bilingual education throughout the city in conjunction with desegregation. ""I just want to try to get through the next two months,"" Matsuda stated. ""There is no way to completely erase all errors we may make but we will try to do our best.""

The first Vietnamese market in the ID opened September 29 at 508 South King Street. Mr. and Mrs. Harry Tavenner and daughter Huong Le run the Thien-Thai Grocery Co.


They hope to open up a gift shop next door at 510 South King Street within two months. The ID Special Review Board has approved a store sign for both shops.


Daughter Huong Le, once a hairdresser, now buys the merchandise. ""I have to order and go once a month to Los Angeles and San Francisco,"" she said. ""We want to see how business is going before we do direct importing."" The American father, Harry Tavenner, handles the inventory. Mrs. Tavenner manages the market with her daughter.


""We do have a lot of Vietnamese refugees in Seattle, about 5,000,"" said Huong Le. ""My mom and dad didn't want to open up a shop. But now that she's older, she (mother) likes to do it (for her retirement savings).""


""It takes time to build it up (the clientele) because we don't have ads,"" continued Huong Le. ""We have an ad in the Vietnamese newspaper, Dat Moi (New Land).""


It is open Wednesday through Monday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Approximately 130 employees, the majority Korean immigrants, recently ended a strike against the Buffalo Sanitory Wipers Co., a factory which recycles used clothing into rags for commercial use.


The May strike was called in response to growing dissatisfaction with low wages and unhealthy working conditions. In an eight-hour day, workers stand in one spot sorting and cutting bales of material. Workers felt they were not being paid fairly and asked for a wage increase.


Other strike grievances were health and safety issues. ""Fans are ineffective, and there are no windows in the basement,"" said one employee. Many must wear surgical masks to prevent breathing in the cotton dust that permeates the room.


In the course of recycling used clothing, workers must sometimes handle unsanitary and insect beridden articles. The right to refuse handling these bales constitutes another issue.


The warehouse presents more safety hazards. One worker alone must transport 600 to 1400 pound clothing bales, with the aid of a handtruck. Since assistance from other workers is prohibited, many accidents occur when workers try to lift oversized bales.


""In the last week, three people have been hit by falling bales, myself included,"" said Sue Docekal, a warehouse-person. The injuries, which sometimes require sick leave, could be prevented by calling for assistance when necessary, she said.


The strikers also called for extended sick leave, and a better cost of living clause.


In the initial phases of the strike, union officials of Local 117 (Teamsters' Union) supported the Buffalo Sanitary Wiper Co. workers. But many workers believe that union support gradually diminished. When the strike ended in June, little had been gained by the workers. The final negotiations yielded a 30 cent per hour pay increase with a 25 cents per hour increase each successive year. The strikers had originally asked for a $2 increase, with a $1 increase each successive year.


The only other concession made was that, in refusing to handle unsanitary bales, the worker must first receive the supervisor's consent. All other strike demands were rejected.


In trying to secure strike gains, Docekal, an employee for four years, participated in the union and company negotiations. She attributed the failure of the strike to Local 117's lack of support. She believes the union did very little in trying to seek the support of other locals, or publicity from the mass media. Therefore, strikers had to rely on word-of-mouth.


Locals 741 (transfer drivers), 177 IBEW (electricians), and 104 (boilermakers) were among the unions that supported the strike with donations. Docekal said none of those funds were ever filtered through the union, to the strikers and their families.


Strikers were advised by the union that they could be replaced by scab workers if the Buffalo Sanitary Wiper Co. decided to go non-union, Docekal explained. As a result, many were intimidated by the possibility of losing their jobs, without support funds to sustain their families during the strike.


Union officials at Local 117 headquarters refused to comment, or were out of town.


One of the significant advancements of the strike, Docekal said, was the important role that the Korean immigrants took in the strike. ""They had a sense of unity and strength in holding out in the strike,"" she said. Their active role was largely due to a Korean worker who translated for the immigrants in the union meetings. For this reason, Docekal feels confident about the future. She summed it up by stating that ""The strike served to build an alliance between the immigrant and American-born workers.""

The City Council's Transportation Committee will hold hearings Nov. 22 on an ordinance appropriating city funds to the Port of Seattle's study to build an intermodal transportation center at Union Station. The committee -- consisting of Jeanette Williams, George Benson and Paul Kraabel -- will then recommend to the full council whether it should allocate $25,000 to the Port's study.


The Port has applied for a $350,000 grant from the Department of Transportation to study the conversion of Union Station. A preliminary report completed in August called for a transportation center housing Amtrak, Greyhound, Airport Bus Service, Trailways, Evergreen/Cascade Trailways, and Greyline Tours.


The grant asks for $140,000 in local funding; $25,000 from the City. Mayor Charles Royer has already approved the ordinance, and now it is up to the Council to pass it into law.


In a letter sent to the City Council, Mayor Royer indicated he had been assured by the Port that it would conduct an environmental impact statement of the proposed center and would encourage community participation in the study. ""Based on these commitments by the Port,"" Royer wrote, ""I can support the study and recommend that the City participate in it.""


Throughout the month of November, the City Council has been busy with budget preparations. Tom Rasmussen, legislative assistant to Councilmember Williams, said the budget has made it difficult to consider other matters, such as the Port's application.


""She (Williams) has not had a chance to actually review this ordinance as carefully as she wants to, to make a decision,"" Rasmussen said. ""She has never taken a position one way or the other."" Committee members Benson and Kraabel could not be contacted for comment.


If the Transportation Committee makes a decision Nov. 22, the ordinance may go before a council vote the following Monday, Nov. 27. Because the $25,000 must come out of emergency funds, seven of the nine council members must approve the ordinance.


Councilmember Dolores Sibonga has sent a letter to her colleagues, raising questions about the Port's study. Sibonga, a former Board president of Inter*im, has talked to people in the community, and she is concerned with the impact the transportation center will have.


""The letter just says we've looked into the issue, and there are a number of questions we want answered,"" said Rita Elway, Sibonga's assistant. ""We are concerned with the quality of life; the traffic and air quality in the district, and the possible neutralization of past city efforts to improve the district.""

Calling 911 for emergency services can be a frustrating experience if you are unfamiliar with the procedure and are not prepared with required information. For those not fluent in English, their problem is doubled.


Neighborhood House has been funded by LEAA (Law Enforcement Assistance Administration) to develop a system by which non-English-speaking persons will have access to the 911 emergency aid telephone system in Seattle.


LEAA is a program to work with communities and existing law enforcement agencies to improve public safety and lower the crime rate.


""The primary focus of this program will be to provide after hours emergency services,"" says Kristin O'Donnell, project coordinator, ""when other bi-lingual services are not available."" The program will utilize volunteers in much the same way the Crisis Clinic and Rape Relief does. These volunteers will be bi-lingual, trained to handle emergency calls.


The need for such a service became apparent with the large number of non-English speaking Chinese living at Yesler Terrace. ""They usually call a relative or friend who speaks English, and they in turn call for emergency services,"" says O'Donnell. ""This delays getting help considerably."" Although the program was developed by the Yesler Terrace Community Council and Neighborhood House, it will be a city-wide program.


""We're currently trying to identify the number of people this type of program would serve and determine the best possible system with which to serve them,"" O'Donnell said. ""Our primary goal is to get down to a system that is efficient and inexpensive.""


The program is in the developmental states. ""We're trying to get input from as many organizations as possible that work with non-English speaking peoples,"" O'Donnell said. ""We had a meeting on March 31, but unfortunately no organization working within the International District was represented.""


In drawing up the plan for the program, O'Donnell and program assistant Negash Atsbeha will be contacting community people from the various non-English speaking communities of Seattle. ""We would appreciate hearing from anyone who has helpful suggestions."" O'Donnell and Atsbeha can be reached at Yesler Terrace Neighborhood House, 447-4522.

Mental health conference for minorities


More than 150 persons from four states are expected to attend the Northwest Mental Health Conference on Minority Groups March 17 and 18, in the Seattle federal building.


The conference is sponsored by the Western Center for Continuing Education in Mental Health, a branch of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICE).


This is one of three conferences scheduled throughout the West to identify mental health needs and resources among Blacks, Chicanos, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. The other conferences will be in Denver and Northern California.


Keynote speaker Dr. Juan Ramos, director of special mental health programs for the National Institute of Mental Health, will explore major issues affecting minority groups.


In workshops, participants from Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington will discuss: available resources for mental health workers seeking to develop programs for minority groups; how to develop these programs; and how to train personnel in minority issues.


Persons interested in minority mental health who wish to attend should contact Celia Ramos, King County Concilio, Seattle, (206) 447-4891, or Faye Munoz, conference coordinator, at WICHE, Boulder, Colo. (303) 492-6705. No registration fee will be charged.


Merchants Parking Association Program


Free parking is being offered for patrons of Mikado, Kayo, Atlas and Gim Wah through a validation program. This is being administered by the Merchants Parking Association. The program was started in response from a mandate by the I.D. Special Review Board to develop a parking plan to accommodate Domed Stadium traffic.


The Merchants Parking Association is a nonprofit corporation with initial financing provided by Inter*im and the International District Economic Association. The program will become financially self-sufficient in the future.


The validation system is only with participating I.D. businesses. Tickets are sold to business at a cost of $.40 each; this allows the business's customers to park free at different parking locations.


Currently the Merchants Parking has use of the following lots for the program: Seattle First, United Savings, KCW Furniture, Rainier Bank, Uwajimaya.


Monthly parking is also available for a charge of $10 a month. If you're an I.D. firm with five or more employees who wish to have monthly parking you can get a 20 percent discount.


The Merchants Parking is located at 318-6th Ave. So., Suite 101. Phone 624-3426.


New transit stops on South Jackson


Metro transit-stops on South Jackson Street will change soon. In a March 6 meeting, the Special Review Board voted for a ""mid-block configuration."" This means a whole block will be used as a stop during peak hours: 6 to 9 am, northbound; and 3:30 to 6:30 pm, southbound. The new northbound location will be between Maynard and 7th Avenues. These stops will be able to accommodate the new 60-foot buses to be put in use January, 1979.


Anti-Bakke march set for April 8


The National Committee to Overturn the Bakke Decision (NCOBD) will culminate its campaign on the Bakke case with nation-wide protest in April.


In Seattle, on April 8, the NCOBD will host a civil rights march from Hing Hay Park in the International District to the downtown federal courthouse, at 5th Ave. and Maddison St. The Saturday march, which will begin from the park at 1 p.m., will focus national attention on the case which may set the precedent on affirmative action for many years to come.


""This will be the last chance we will have to call upon the Supreme Court to render a decision that gives minorities and women a fair measure of justice."" said Jacqueline Agtuca, northwest regional coordinator of the NCOBD. ""This will be the last chance for the people to speak out in protest, before the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the case.""


For more information about the march, call the NCOBD, 682-0690.


Noted Japanese sociologist appointed acting UW dean


University of Washington President John Hogness recently appointed a noted Japanese American sociologist acting dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.


Dr. S. Frank Miyamoto, associate dean of the UW arts and sciences since 1975, professor of sociology, and faculty member since 1945, will become acting dean February 1.


Miyamoto's appointment was announced by Hogness at the January 13 meeting of the Board of Regents.


Meanwhnile, a nationwide search for a permanent dean has been initiated by Hogness.


Miyamoto, 65, a Seattle native, is believed to be the first Asian American to become acting dean at the UW.


He was chair of the University's Department of Sociology from 1966 to 1971 and has been a full professor since 1963. He received his bachelor's degree in sociology from the UW in 1936. His master's thesis was: ""Social Solidarity among the Japanese in Seattle.""


Before returning to the UW, he was research assistant from 1944 to 1945, studying the Japanese American evacuation during World War II and resettlement.


Miyamoto lives with his wife, Michiko, in Bellevue.


The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest academic unit in the University, with approximately 900 faculty and an enrollment of 21,453, 17,600 undergraduates.


University Heights holds 'Asian month'


University Heights Elementary School will focus March and April on Asian American history and culture.

Newly-appointed Director of the Employment Opportunity Center (EOC) Lanston Chinn said he would like to expand EOC's scope of services.


""Just generally,"" said Chinn, ""to expand its scope in terms of its basic operations. It's a private, non-profit organization. It has got to seek, at least in my opinion, more stable funding. The majority of the counselors are CETA positioned.""


Gerald Laigo, Chairman of the Board of Directors for EOC, said ""The major mandate for Chinn is to assure continuation of funding of services.


""The thing that counts is a viable situation. In getting people employed, we have to have sufficient funding.""


Laigo said Chinn was chosen as director because of his ethnic background and his involvement with social programs in New York. Laigo himself did not participate in the final analysis of the selection of director because he had prior acquaintance with Chinn.


Chinn's list of credentials includes being a Special Assistant and Community Coordinator to the President in Manhattan, where he was ""responsible for programatic development within the greater Chinatown, West Side and Harlem communities."" He was also consultant for the Youth Service Agency in New York where he authored the Educational Incentive Program and served as a developmental consultant to the executive director on a per diem basis.


Presently, Chinn is on leave from the University of Washington where he is working toward his Ph.D. in Political Science.


Another board member, Fred Takayesu, said Chinn was the best qualified of all the candidates. Takayesu said Chinn had experience, education, and knowledge of the community.


""I haven't seen Lanston on the job,"" said Takayesu, ""but I'm sure he's doing a good job. The organization is running smoothly so I assume he is running smoothly. Based on his qualifications, there should be no problem.""


The director has to know what's going on in the community and how to manage people, said Takayesu, qualities which Chinn has.


Chinn, like Laigo, said it was premature to say how he was doing as director. Chinn says it depends partly on how successful he is in securing more stable funding.


EOC was established by Asians in 1971 in the International District. The program moved out to the Rainier Valley under the Seattle Model City Program. With a staff of bilingual counselors, it provides job placement and followup services to Asians as well as other groups.

It was Seafair time in the International District. I remembered years past when little children lined the streets, colorful floats drifted by, marching bands strutted on the downbeat, and the Dragon roared and shook its ugly head. But the Chinatown parade never came this year. The little children stayed home, the floats and bands had moved away, and the Dragon was silent. This year, we had a disco.


They held a dance at the Hing Hay Park earlier this month. Music was provided by Lowdown, a group playing the Top 40 sounds of radio stations that all the teenyboppers listen to. Two dance instructors from the Arthur Murray dance studio were on hand to do their imitation of John Travolta. The only connection with Seafair was a token appearance by the Seafair pirates who seemed out of place amid the disco dancing crowd.


The musicians weren't too bad but they were LOUD. With amplifiers magnifying each chord, nobody got any sleep in the Distict until midnight. But the teenyboppers loved it and wanted more.


The crowd was a curious mix of young and old, native born and immigrant, drunk, high, and sober, with a lot of in-between. Teenaged hookers asked prospective customers if they were old enough. One old salt, dressed like a fugitive from a Popeye cartoon, swaggered onto the stage where the band was playing, intending to make his presence known and staring menacingly toward the dancers who ignored him. The old residents sitting in the park were pushed aside as ""Saturday Night Fever"" infected the audience.


Yes, the District was invaded by a bunch of old folks whose parents didn't know or didn't care where they were. There was no trouble as the police and emergency units were conspicuous. The undercover cops, however, were pretty noticeable. They looked too old to be teenyboppers.


People tell me that it costs a lot of money to put on a parade. In addition, roads have to be blocked off, cops have got to be paid overtime, and more hassles are involved because a multitude of people are involved. So, they tried something different this year -- a disco in the park. Now, I don't know about reasons for the change, but I do know that my grandmothers like parades.


Would you take your grandmother to a disco?

Al Masigat, long-time International District resident, will be featured in a film documentary on Filipino immigrants in the District.


The film series, Pearls, is being produced by the Educational Film Center. A camera crew was filming in the District earlier this month.


Masigat took time out to describe to The Examiner his saga in America, some of which will be captured on film.


""You will find gold in the streets,"" said the English-speaking teacher to Al Masigat, encouraging him to immigrate to the United States.


""I was born January 29, 1904 in Laoag City in the province of Ilocos Norte in the Philippines,"" said Masigat. ""I had two brothers who died in World War II and I have a sister. My parents are both gone.""


In the Philippines, American teachers taught Masigat United States history and English. He said they encouraged him to come to America. Masigat graduated from high school; and at 22, he sailed to the United States. ""I came to further my education and for the land,"" he explained. ""I wanted adventure in the fertile land.""


He said there were 375 people on one boat. ""I was seasick all the way through,"" he said. ""When you're traveling third class (steerage), well, everything's on it.""


Masigat attended St. Martin College for a while and then he began his American adventure.


""My first job was picking strawberries across the bay (Bainbridge Island) for about 10 to 11 days,"" recalled Masigat. Eventually he settled into a routine of working in an Alaska cannery during the winter and becoming a migrant farmer during the summer.


Masigat said he never found the promised ""gold in the streets,"" but that he's been through a lot of adventures in his many occupations.


Masigat remembers when cannery workers first wanted to organize a union. ""I helped get the men whenever they needed men to have demonstrations,"" said Masigat. ""I contributed for a delegate to be sent to the meetings, who was like a lawyer (mediator), for the settlement.""


During his farm/labor days, Masigat was again into reform movements.


""I remember one incident,"" stated Masigat, ""when there was only 25 of us workers on a grape farm. We decided that we should do something about our wages ($0.25 an hour). Every morning I asked our foreman to see if the price of grapes went up. One day it did. We decided to ask the farmer for a raise. He said, 'I can't do it. I belong to an organization that is against raising wages.'


""We organized the seven surrounding farms and we all quit working. We were told to leave town. Before this strike, we bought our groceries and stored it in a Filipino store.


""After three days of the strike, the president of the farm organization asked us to come back (without honoring the workers' demands for $0.35 an hour). We refused. After seven days, they asked us back and gave us a raise ($0.35 an hour). We wanted $0.40 an hour. After ten days when the grapes were ready to fall off, they gave us $0.40 an hour. We refused, we wanted $0.45. They finally agreed only if I don't come back as a farm worker, but as a cook.""


Masigat smiled mischievously, explaining that he has always been somewhat of a black sheep.


Masigat said the first Seattle hotel he stayed in was the Great Northern Hotel at 5th Avenue, Washington and Main. The last five years, he has lived at the Frye Hotel. ""Every hotel in the ID, I've lived in at some time,"" said Masigat. ""If I don't like something, I just pick up and move. I don't complain.""


""When I retired in 1970,"" said Masigat, ""The Domed Stadium was being proposed. Everyone was upset that the ID would be closed off. But I felt that if they (the government) close some parts of the ID (for the development of something like the Domed Stadium), they must replace something of what they take.""


Masigat remembered another successful adventure. The Frye, Downtowner and Terrace View Hotels were subsidized rentals. He remembers a federal regulation limiting the minority occupancy rate in those hotels. Masigat helped organize residents against this regulation. It was changed to first come, first serve.


His last full-time job was as a kitchen helper at the Clark Restaurant in the ID Chamber of Commerce. He worked there for nine years until it closed down. Masigat said he held this job the longest and it was his favorite since he could meet so many people.


Masigat now works part-time as a nutritional counselor for Filipino elderly.


""I believe in what my fortune teller said before I left the Philippines,"" said Masigat. ""She said, 'Whatever you do, you will always be poor and you will accomplish nothing. But when you grow older, you will find lots of friends.'""


""I sometimes send my sister a little money,"" said Masigat. But she wrote back recently, he said, and told me that seeing me would be worth more than all the money I could possibly send.


""I'd like to go back and see the Philippines and my sister,"" mused Masigat. ""I first came to make money and go back. But I arrived so seasick I changed my mind. I told myself that maybe I'll never come back until they build a bridge.""

The Seattle Port Commission has authorized its staff to apply for a $350,000 planning grant to study development of the old Union Station into an intermodal transportation center.


The Port's August 8 action followed completion of a three-month preliminary investigation into the feasibility of developing the site. The preliminary report by consultant Dan Dingfield recommends construction of a $17 million facility at Union Station, with Amtrak, Greyhound, Trailways, Airport Bus Service, Greyline Tours and Evergreen/Cascade Trailways to occupy the site.


According to the report, the Port would construct a 50,000 square foot, two-level terminal building immediately south of the station. And the General Services Administration would convert the old Union Station building into office space for a federal agency, possibly the Immigration and Naturalization Service.


According to Dingfield's preliminary report, the terminal ""could contribute substantially to the (ID) community in a number of ways.""


""It could provide employment opportunities, alleviate some on-street parking pressures, provide entrepreneurial concession opportunities, bring many new consumers into contact with the community, and contribute to the aesthetic features at the western edge of the District,"" the report states.


But the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) is spearheading community opposition to the project, pointing to potential damaging effects of the project: traffic congestion, decline in air quality and an increase in land speculation.


Jim Dwyer, senior director of planning and port relations, said, ""If the community does not want it (the terminal), we're not going to proceed. If there is sizeable opposition from the community, we won't proceed.""


If they build...


Bob Santos, Inter Im director, said his organization is trying to work with property owners to renovate the old vacant hotels into low-income housing. ""If they build the transportation center,"" Santos said, ""owners will want to hold the property aside, waiting for speculators to develop commercial stores and shops to cater to the transportation center instead of the residents.""


The Inter*Im board of directors voted to oppose the application for the planning grant, following the August 8 Port Commissioners meeting.


Santos, who was at the Port meeting, told the Commissioners the $17 million transportation terminal would make property owners hesitant about renovating hotels for District residents. He cited the Downtowner Apartments, a 250-unit low-income housing project, which the owners had expressed interest in converting into a tourist hotel.


""What's so bad about that?"" asked Paul Friedlander, Commission president. ""To bring 240 tourists into the City would be good.""


""Do you mean you would put 240 Seattleresidents outin the street in order to accommodate people from out of town?"" asked Santos.


Friedlander replied that housing can always be found for elderly, and that bringing in people from out of town is good for Seattle's economy.


Dwyer said later that Friedlander's comments were ""an unfortunate misunderstanding.""


""He (Friedlander) didn't really understand the issue,"" said Dwyer. ""He wasn't familiar with the air-hotel concept and that there would be the displacement of people. He didn't intend his statement to mean, ""Citizens be damned, full speed ahead.""


There was another apparent misunderstanding which arose out of an August 18 lunch meeting between representatives of Inter*Im and the Port.


Inter*Im representatives said they came away from the meeting feeling the Port was not going to pursue the planning grant because of the community's opposition; they felt the Union Station idea had been killed.


Rod Kawakami, attorney, said, ""Just from what was said at the meeting, the Port left us with the impression that they weren't going to pursue the grant. They made comments like, 'We may have saved a $350,000 study with a $8 lunch.' They also asked us whether we would be satisfied if they wrote a letter to say the project is killed. All their ending comments left us with the impression they weren't going to pursue the matter.""


Dwyer, one of the Port representatives at the meeting, said the Port representatives were only posing ""rhetorical questions,"" asking why they should pursue the project if Inter*Im opposed even the $350,000 study. He and Richard Ford, executive director of the Port, the other Port representative at the meeting, did not mean they were not going to apply for the $350,000, said Dwyer.


Will pursue grant


""I think we will pursue the grant,"" said Dwyer.


Bob Santos said, ""If they are going ahead, I don't know why they said those things (at the meeting) at all.""


Ford said, ""The group we met with made it very clear they didn't even want the study. It's a question of whether we want to go ahead with the heavy opposition. They (Inter*Im) may represent an interest.


""The only thing we're talking about is whether the transportation center should be evaluated through a careful study process. I just don't know how to evaluate our responsibility to the community-at-large.""


Weigh it


Ford said the Port would not go ahead with the project ""if we were shown that the impacts are so intolerable that the (ID) community could not bear it.""


""You have to weigh it in terms of what it really means to the people in the area,"" said Ford.


Dwyer said Inter*Im is opposed to ""anything down there (next to the ID) unless they are assured there will be no increase in property tax values."" But, he said, the Port project would probably impact property tax values less than other possible developments such as expansion of Antique World, which presently occupies the Union Station building.


""What's the direct corollary between Union Station and the housing issue?"" asked Dwyer.


Only a technical study, said Dwyer, could produce information about the impact the additional traffic would have on the District.


""I don't think we can say there won't be more traffic,"" he said, ""but you have to remember a lot of it is 'subgrade.'"" The preliminary study calls for ""500 cars of atgrade parking developed around theperiphery of the bus staging concourse area.""


""I think,"" said Dwyer, ""he (Santos) is grasping at what ever he can to prejudge the whole program.""


But, said Santos, ""I couldn't think of anything that would impact the District more than a $17 million transportation terminal. If you bring in more cars, you bring in more air pollution.""


Housing crisis


Moving the bus stations into the area, Santos said, will increase the number of low-income people looking for housing in the District. The housing needs of the present residents are not being met, he said. The Union Station redevelopment could aggravate the concentration of low-income people in the District, Santos added, contrary to the stated goal of the City to disperse low-income housing throughout Seattle.


The deadline for the grant application is September 19.


Three years ago, a similar, but larger-scale redevelopment plan was dropped when the Port determined the plan would not be economically feasible. This plan, which called for construction of a 1500 to 2000 car parking structure with a hotel on top, provoked strong community opposition.


According to Dingfield's report, ""The rate of construction cost inflation in recent years has been such that the costs assigned to the parking structure and the hotel are significantly beyond what the market for each in the area will bear.""


Consultant Dingfield said government subsidy money for the transportation center construction is contained in Congressional legislation which stands a good chance of passage.


""We will be looking at all possibilities of stopping the project to protect our community,"" said Santos, ""including the possibility of stopping it in the courts. With everything that's happened, the District is getting smaller and smaller. You have the Domed Stadium on one side, the I-5 (freeway) on another side, the industrial area to the south, the downtown business district on the north.


""And now we have this transportation center. Everything is dumped on us.""

In 1976, Mon Faye Hong took a big gamble.


He was earning good money as an engineer for the Boeing Company. Hong's personal successes had included: a long-awaited new-born son, his working-wife-turned-homemaker, a comfortable home on Beacon Hill, membership in social and civic groups such as the International District Special Review Board, Chinese Community Service Organization and Chinese Mixed Bowling Club.


Yet in 1976, he chucked this easy life. He became a cook and part-owner of the Atlas Cafe with his younger brother, Hugo Louie.


This occupational trade-off makes Hong unique. Most young adult Asians with higher education fly the nest, so to speak, and shun career employment in the ID.


Hong was born in China in 1941. At eleven, he came to the United States and attended local schools. Before Hong's birth, his father, Louie Hong, came alone to the United States to find a new way of life for his family. He returned to China to bring his wife and son to America, but the outbreak of World War II interfered with his plans. Because of the disorder brought on by war, Louie had no choice but to return to the United States alone.


Because of an immigration mix-up, Louie Hong's last name became Louie. His son, Faye Hong, retained their original last name when he arrive. Thus, the father and younger siblings are known as Louie, and the eldest son is known as Hong.


""My mother was stranded (in China) and I was born,"" recalled Hong. ""We went back to the village after the Japanese took over. In 1949, the Communists came (to mainland China) so we went back to Hong Kong."" In 1950, Mrs. Louie joined her husband in the United States and two years later, Faye Hong arrived.


He attended Bailey Gatzert, Edison Technical School (""for one summer to better my English,"" said Hong), Washington Junior High School and Franklin High School. In 1966, he received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington.


His dad gave up his taxi-driving job and bought the Atlas Cafe in 1956. Louie had no prior experience in the restaurant business, but he ""wanted to be his own boss,"" explained Hong. With the aid of his wife's limited kitchen skills and an experienced Chinese cook, Louie soon found himself in business.


Hong remembers helping out after school and during the summer. He said the old Chinese cook taught him all he knows about cooking. During college, he picked up more experience by cooking part-time at the old Gim Ling and the Mandarin restaurants.


After his college graduation, Hong went to work at the Boeing Company for ten years. He said he thought he could work full-time as an engineer and part-time as a cook at Atlas, but it became too exhausting.


""It was a choice of working with (and for) my family, whereas with the other job, I was just working for myself,"" said Hong. ""One was a challenge (and the other), there was not much to choose. (The engineering job) was a good place for a paycheck every week, but you feel yourself wasted.""


In 1976, after the remodeling and expansion of the Atlas Cafe, Faye Hong became a full-time cook and restauranteur.


He said the old Atlas made enough money for a day-to-day existence, but ""only through expansion, could my mom and dad retire now."" The restaurant has always had a large clientele, but now it serves even more. With this business increase, the sons can better help out their retired parents. Hong said he does not want his parents to work all their lives. His parents retired this year. Hong, his brother, Hugo Louie, and sister, Susan Woo, now work at the restaurant.


Hong's typical day starts at 11 in the morning. He reads his newspaper and eats his main meal with his wife, son, and mother. He then goes to work. Around one o'clock, he enters the restaurant to cut up the meats and vegetables for the day's cooking. Besides all the food cutting, sauce preparations, and noodle frying, Hong checks on the bulk food orders for the day. Hong stands on his feet cooking from four o'clock until midnight. Then he cleans up and cooks a snack for his help (five cooks and assistant cooks, three waiters and one full-time hostess). He drives some of the workers home and arrives home at one in the morning. Hong relaxes with his family. His wife and son have arranged their hours around this night life. At around 3:30 a.m., Hong retires for the night.


""I am looking for better things to come yet,"" Hong said. ""But this place has limited potential."" He has no plans to make the Atlas Cafe a formal, high-class Chinese restaurant. ""I like to cater to the working people,"" he said. ""Here the reputation and clientele is already established. The ID has an attraction for my kind of restaurant business.""


Hong's concern with the development of the ID prompted him to become a member of the ID Special Review Board. ""I wanted to participate in the decision-making process during the changing of the International District,"" he said. However, after he became a full-time restauranteur, he said, he had no time to ably perform this civic role. He then resigned his position.


Hong said he has no regrets about trading in his earlier ""soft"" job for the hard work of the Atlas Cafe. He said he gets a lot of self-satisfaction from the restaurant's growth. The financial rewards of both jobs are about the same.


Like his father did before him, Faye Hong took a risk and made some personal sacrifices ""to be his own boss.""

The Seattle Arts Commission felt that artists should not be isolated from the community in which they worked. And it felt that the community should not be isolated from its resident artists.


Its Artist in the City Program is designed to encourage interaction between the artist and the local businesses, and increase the artist's exposure. This, in turn, would initiate local interest and appreciation for what an artist can create and what energy, skills and resources go into that creative process.


This program, funded by the Comprehensive Employment Training Act (CETA), has enabled Vic Kubo to work as an artist in residence under the supervision of the nationally known sculptor, George Tsutakawa.


Tsutakawa, his son Gerald, and Kubo are fashioning a bronze sculpture of Tsutakawa's design. The sculpture, part of the International District Streetscaping Project, will measure 4' x 4' x 12' high when finished. It will be mounted on a 16"" high concrete pedestal which will serve the dual purpose of a base for the sculpture and a bench for pedestrians. The sculpture will be located at Maynard Ave. and Jackson, across from InterIm. By early June, Tsutakawa hopes to put the finishing touches on the sculpture, although the dedication ceremony probably won't be until early September, depending on the process of the Streetscaping Project.


Kubo said, ""Basically, what I do is the hand work on the sculpture -- cutting, pounding, grinding and polishing.""


Kubo was enthusiastic about his work and emphasized that he was learning much from Tsutakawa, including the use of tools. ""I also learn to deal with things as they come up,"" said Kubo, ""because we can't expect everything to go smoothly."" Just figuring out the best way to put two pieces of metal together is a problem, said Kubo. They are working on four different sections of the sculpture separately and will soon be faced with the problem of fitting them together in a sturdy, yet aesthetic . . ..


Kubo explained that he has no formal sculpting experience or training prior to his apprenticeship to Tsutakawa. Kubo has always been interested in art, ever since he began to watch his grandfather paint. ""I can remember being intrigued by the way he could push around those gobs of color with a brush until they became recognizeable images,"" he said. Throughout his high school years, Kubo took all types of woodwork and shop classes and learned how to work with many types of materials. He graduated in 1974 from a well-known art school in Seattle and has since made his living off of various freelance projects. Although he has found there are more job opportunities in graphics, the fine arts are more satisfying to his ""desire to create.""


Kubo's contract with the Artist in the City Program, which began March 1, 1978, will last six months. In the remaining two months, Kubo plans to do a series of sketches and paintings depicting the artists' efforts that went into the production of the sculpture. According to Kubo, too many people see a finished product and it is easy to take that product for granted as though it had mysteriously sprouted overnight. He hopes to display his project series in the community around the time of the dedication.

""If you are going to be a woman, you'd better be living in the United States; but if you are going to be a woman and grow old, you'd better be living in China."" This was the message of Dr. Isabella Yen, one of four panel speakers at the second in a series of workshops on the economic status of older women held at the Langston Hughes Cultural Center last month. Yen focused on older women in the Chinese family structure.


In China, she said a female traditionally improves her status as she ages. As a young woman, she is viewed as a liability -- one who must be provided with a dowry so she can be married. As a mother, Yen said, she gains status because children, especially sons, mean an investment in the future. The mother's main responsibility is to raise her children according to traditional values. The grandmother, especially one who is widowed, governs the household domain. She is treated with respect by the younger family members because ""she has done so much for the family,"" said Yen.


With the influx of Western values, the Chinese family system changed. The extended family began to break apart, said Yen, as each nuclear family established its own household. But one problem evolves from this change: If children all lived with their own families, the duties and responsibilities of each are not clear. How much of an obligation does one have toward one's parents?


Following the panel presentation, Dr. Yen had an opportunity to expand on what she discussed earlier. She sees her own generation in America as ""transitional."" Some women her age have found employment, which has had two important consequences. First, their daily routine has extended beyond the household. Second, their income can provide them with a pension or social security, which will give them more financial stability in old age.


These two factors, said Yen, help dissolve the domestic, ""matriarch"" role many elderly women once filled. Yet, self-support does not solve everything. Dr. Yen noted that those of the transitional generation with elderly parents are confronted with a dilemma. On one hand, they have obtained ""freedom"" from obligation to their parents -- their households are separate and they are economically independent. However, many do not completely accept this freedom and feel guilty or irresponsible if they leave their parents to take care of themselves, or place them in nursing homes.


Should one assume the burden of giving diligent care to elderly parents and, thus, feel locked into a restricted lifestyle? Or should one exercise the freedom inspired by Western culture? Dr. Yen said everyone has to work out these problems for themselves. She added that it would be beneficial if young Asians got together to discuss the issues and try to help one another find solutions.


The moderator, Clare Bright, who teaches Women Studies courses at the University of Washington, confronted the issue of power and the aging woman. She divided power into subcategories. Most forms of power, she said, have been traditionally controlled by males: physical strength, economic, military and political. The last three normally have been dominated by white, middle-class males. Traditional female forms of power are: beauty, sexuality and motherhood. Bright pointed out that elderly women typically lose their forms of power and thus lack self-determination in directing their own lives.


Phyllis Sturges of the Washington State Community College Consortium on Aging addressed the question: Why are older women poor? First, she said, women normally live longer than their partners and must spread a scarce income over more years. If they did work, their jobs were typically lower-paying than those held by males, thus leaving comparatively less to be drawn from after retirement. Also, a great number of women have not been educated in planning future financial programs for old age, she said. Sturges commented that reform would have to come from elderly women, themselves, to raise their own consciousness and actively protect their rights.


Dolores Polomo, University of Washington English Professor, investigated literature in Europe and America for the images presented of elderly female characters. Too often, they were depicted as sweet, but senile old aunts, both very domestic and passive, she said. When they did have any power, it was normally due to wealth, and they were characterized as manipulative and motivated by self-interest. A few, rare selections of contemporary literature treated elderly women with much more sensitivity; she noted the authors were all women.


Setting aside armchair discussion, Dorothy Pounds, who writes the Seattle Times column, ""The Black Experience,"" proposed a ""revolution"" of sorts. She maintained there was a certain beauty in poor, elderly women ""making do"" in the world, but they should be granted some dignity in their lifestyle. She suggested a new ideology to accompany this revolution -- ""mature allure"" -- which implies an acceptance of age as part of the ""normal flow of life."" Contemporary Western societies value youth and beauty. Thus, most elderly women feel they have lost their self-worth. Pounds stated that ""most women don't see themselves as expensive orchids in full bloom, although they should.""


Not about to be caught up in all-talk-and-no-action, Pounds began to organize the audience that day to start a senior activity center. She asked one participant to call a downtown department store to see if they would sponsor a fashion show exclusively for elderly women.


On the whole, the workshop panelists seemed to endorse one philosophy, which might be summed up by a comment made by Dr. Yen: ""A human being is a human being. You cannot separate."" Young people should remember the elderly are part of our own flesh and blood.

Washington, D.C. -- President Carter last month signed a bill to provide the Territory of American Samoa with a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives.


In signing H.R. 13702, President Carter stated, ""The United States should recognize in view of this history that American Samoa is a permanent part of American political life deserving of representation in the United States Congress. The American Samoa delegate legislation provides that recognition.""


""By signing this bill, I am signaling to the world that the United States remains committed to the well-being of American Samoa, to the development of democratic representation, and to our close brotherhood with the people of American Samoa.""


The legislation, sponsored by Representative Phillip Burton (D-Calif.), was passed by both the House and the Senate in the closing days of the 95th Congress. Mark Tajima, Washington Coordinator for the Pacific/Asian Coalition (PAC), noted that last minute efforts by Rep. Phillip Burton and Sen. Spark Matsunaga (D-Hawaii) -- with the behind the scenes work of Eni Hunkin, a Congressional staff member from American Samoa -- were ""instrumental in ensuring the bill's passage.""


The bill passed by the House of Representatives on October 3 authorizes American Samoa to elect a nonvoting delegate, beginnig in 1980. The House bill limits eligibility for the position to American Samoans who have been U.S. citizens for at least seven years.


When the bill reached the Senate, Senator Spark Matsunaga expressed concern about the eligibility limitation. ""For me, and for my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, this limitation is unacceptable since it would effectively limit the office of delegate to a small percentage of American Samoans who have become U.S. citizens through military service or immigration to the states,"" Matsunaga said.


Because Congress was due to adjourn soon, Burton and Matsunaga agreed it was too late to amend the bill in the Senate to permit American Samoans who are not U.S. citizens to hold the delegate office.


To resolve the problem of the citizenship requirement, an amendment to permit U.S. nationals residing in American Samoa to be eligible for the delegate office was added to another territorial bill which had already passed the Senate and was awaiting House approval. On October 12, the House unaminously approved this amendment, offered by Burton on the House floor. This bill now awaits the President's signature.

Jim Yee likes getting into a community and making things happen, he can rap with kids and he is intrigued by people who are still struggling, working to make life easier. He's involved with Rebop.


Rebop is an organization whose members travel throughout the United States producing short documentaries on minority adolescents. The work is carried out by three production teams which focus on: Latino Americans; Blacks; and Asians and Native Americans. The organization is affiliated with WGBH, a major educational public broadcasting station on the East Coast. It is funded by a grant from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).


The name Rebop was taken from the term used in the fifties by jazz musicians as an expression of rhythm. It signified a mood, a feeling.


The Rebop production team is concerned with capturing on film the unique rhythm of minority adolescent lifestyles. The team is interested in portraying positive images of minorities and combating stereotypes. The emphasis is on interpersonal and interracial relationships. Such relationships range from tense to poignant, to lighthearted. The tremendous task of growing up is a constant theme since it is something people of every color must deal with.


Yee was born in New York City's Chinatown. When his family moved from that poorer section of the city, young Yee found himself in a frightening world. He had never seen so many large, white faces before. Once, he was sent out to buy a newspaper. He clearly remembers his fear as he walked alone, feeling very foreign and conspicuous. When he reached the newstand, he threw his money down, grabbed the paper and ran all the way home. Yee never acquired a taste for New York. He described it as too dirty, too big and too fast paced for him. Right now, he enjoys the more subdued atmosphere of his neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts.


Yee saw parts of the East Coast, South and Midwest by hitchhiking. He happened to be in the northern part of Tennessee when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated and ""got busted left and right"" by locals who thought he was a Northern ""rabble rouser"" who had come to ""revenge King's death."" The following weekend, he drove through Chicago which was in flames because of riots. Needless to say, Yee feels he was ""a part of the sixties."" But now, in the seventies, he has made it out to Seattle--his first time here. This time, he didn't hitchhike; he came with two co-workers, forming the Asian American and Native American production team of Rebop.


For the first two weeks, the team researched Seattle's community adolescents. Using contacts, lists compiled by community leaders and their own brazen initiative, the team met with a large number of youth, searching for a few individuals to portray in a Rebop film.


Yee noted that once the youth realize they are the focus of attention, they become the ""teacher""; they open up. According to Yee, ""everybody has a story,"" but some are more readily picked up by the camera. Inevitably, there are shy interviewees or ones with stories too personal to tell, and they are sifted out of the list of possible film subjects. Jim feels that one of the hardest parts of his job is turning down youth who are not chosen. It is sometimes difficult to make them understand they have not been personally rejected.


Once the film subject is chosen, the Rebop team ""shadows"" the person, accompanying that person along an everyday routine to get a feel for the subject's lifestyle--what goes on with this individual at school, with friends and with family members.


The actual filming is, for the most part, spontaneous. Minimum control is achieved by scripting scenes. That is, setting the individual in a specific environment, either one very familiar to that person, or an entirely new one. Once Yee brought a youth to a carnival and let the camera roll to see what might be caught on film. The setting is an important consideration in filmmaking because it should ""reflect in the most genuine and illuminating way what the story is about,"" said Yee.


Approximately 160 minutes of film is shot for a story. After the filming is finished, Jim said, ""we cross our fingers"" because what is on film is final. Since the team is so mobile, it rarely has a chance to return to a location and refilm a scene. Editing takes place in Boston where the 160 minutes is trimmed down to 12 minutes.


Jim Yee appeared to be satisfied with the work his team did in Seattle. There were no tie-ups or mishaps on this trip. Although the production team members seem to work well together, Yee feels the team should ideally consist of Asian and Native Americans since these are the racial backgrounds of the adolescents they deal with. (Currently, he is the only minority on the three member team.) Yee maintains the issue is one of sensitivity, particularly in understanding minority problems from that minority's perspective.


Yee's plans for the future are open. Rebop's contract with HEW will expire this June and Rebop may have to seek another source of funding. Yee may return to community work in Boston. As for the near future, Yee will go on the road again, to San Francisco; but not with Rebop. This time, he just plans to relax.

The Spokane Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. (JACL) will file a lawsuit within the next few weeks in Spokane, charging Washington State University (WSU) with discrimination against Asian Americans.


According to Gary Iwamoto, one of several volunteers researching the case in Seattle, the complaint will accuse the WSU administration with violating Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title VI requires educational programs receiving federal funds to utilize the money in a non-discriminatory manner.


Lawsuit supporters say the WSU administration has not complied with Title VI because it has failed to establish any Asian American studies program while at the same time providing ethnic studies programs for other ethnic groups. This, the supporters contend, is a discriminatory use of federal funds because it denies one specific minority group advantages offered to all other recognized minorities.


""The major issue is,"" Iwamoto explained, ""if you provide ethnic studies programs and ethnic counselors for other minority groups, can you systematically deny it to Asian Americans?""


Iwamoto is quick to point out that the lawsuit is not intended to divert funds destined for other minority programs, but merely an attempt to obtain equal treatment for Asian Americans at WSU.


""All other recognized groups based on color or ethnicity have their own ethnic studies programs, and their own ethnic counselors, but Asian Americans do not,"" Iwamoto said. ""This is so, even though Asian Americans have constituted the largest or second largest ethnic group at Washington State for several years.""


Currently, WSU offers ethnic studies programs for Black Americans, Native Americans, Chicanos, and a women's studies program.


Aside from the legal issues, Iwamoto feels there is a genuine need for an Asian American studies program at WSU. Some of the Asian Americans he has interviewed while doing research for the case have had substantial difficulty adjusting to the WSU environment. He noted this especially true for those Asian Americans who grew up primarily around other Asian Americans.


When they got to WSU, he explained, they felt alone and alienated from the rest of the student body because they were Asian. Many eventually transferred out of WSU; some have come to the University of Washington, a school which does offer an Asian American studies program.


The lawsuit is only the most recent of several attempts by Asian Americans to establish their own ethnic studies program at WSU.


""The administration (WSU) has promised to set up some type of ethnic studies programs for Asian Americans at WSU since 1973, but has continually failed to do so,"" Iwamoto said.


In December of 1977, as a result of the WSU administration's continued inaction, Denny Yasuhara of the Spokane JACL sought help from Governor Dixie Lee Ray, by calling for an investigation into the ""deplorable conditions for Asian Americans at WSU."" An investigation was made, but the Governor's conclusions proved less than satisfactory.


""I have reviewed the extensive materials Involved and am satisfied that genuine efforts are being made in the affirmative action program at WSU,"" Governor Ray wrote to Yasuhara.


Since then, members of the Asian American Steering Committee have challenged the Governor's conclusions as being based on inaccurate information.


The Spokane JACL has also filed a discrimination complaint with the Civil Rights Office of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare here in Seattle. Action on the complaint is still pending after nearly two years of being on file. Larry Omo, director of the Post-Secondary Education Division of that office, said there are still approximately 20 complaints filed before the JACL one and it may be some time before an actual investigation can be made. But, Omo added, a preliminary investigation will be conducted next week when HEW officials will be on the WSU campus.

UW students plan 'Asian Week'


The University of Washington Asian Student Association (ASA) will sponsor its annual Asian Week May 3 to 6.


""The theme this year will be 'Asian Stream,'"" said Tim Otani, ASA member. ""It shows a constant flow of consciousness or awareness about issues that affect our community and our participation in educational institutions.""


ASA is planning, said Otani, to bring speakers, present cultural exhibits workshops, hold a food fair and sponsor a street fair. The street fair, scheduled for Saturday, May 6, will probably be held in Hing Hay Park in the International District.


ASA will hold a planning meeting at the UW's HUR, room 204M, April 4, at 12:30 p.m. For more information, call 543-9242.


Asian sculpture on display


Selections from a private collection of South and Southeast Asian sculpture will be shown in ""The Sensuous Immortals: Sculpture from the Pan-Asian Collection"" at the Seattle Art Museum, Volunteer Park.


One hundred seventy-five pieces from an anonymous private collection are on view in the exhibit opening March 11 and continuing through April 23. The sculptures span the 2nd century B.C. through the 18th century A.D. They are made of many materials including silver, stucco, bronze and stone.


The exhibition is an opportunity for Northwest viewers to explore regional styles of India, Kashmir, Tibet, and Nepal as well as pieces from the Indianized regions of Southeast Asia and Indonesia including Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Victnam, Sri Lanka and Java.


With few exceptions, the works on view were all created to serve a religious purpose and show the intensity of devotional inspiration in the service of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.


Filipinos to celebrate Narciso-Perez victory


The Filipino community in Seattle will hold a victory celebration for Filipina Narciso and Leonora Perez, following the decision by a U.S. attorney that he will not pursue charges against the two Filipina nurses.


Early last month, U.S. Attorney James Robinson said he would not refile criminal charges against the nurses who had been charged with poisoning and murdering patients in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan.


The nurses' case, which was tainted by charges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation covered up evidence and bribed witnesses, attracted national attention. Many felt the nurses were used as scapegoats.


The Narciso-Perez Support Group of Seattle, in a press statement, said it would ""support any move that would launch...an investigation into the Veterans Administration Hospital deaths.


""Only then,"" the group says, ""can we say that Narciso and Perez are free and the cloud of suspicion lifted from the Filipino community, the Filipino nurses and related technical and medical Asian professionals in the U.S. and the nursing profession in general.""


The group will hold a dance and program Friday, March 17, at the Filipino Community Center, beginning at 8 p.m. Admission is three dollars. For more information, contact Rosita Farinas, 723-8225.


The proceeds will go toward funding a Seattle speaking engagement for the nurses some time this Spring.


Pac-Asian basketball tournament in Seattle


Once again, Pac-Asian basketball will be played in Seattle. But this time, college-age men and women of any age will compete.


The third annual Pac-Asian tournament will be held April 7, 8, and 9. The tourney, featuring West Coast teams, will be played at Cleveland High School and Mercer Junior High.


For the first time, divisions for women and men -- over high school age -- are planned. In previous tournaments, only high-school age boys participated.


Gary Kiyonaga, speaking for the Pac-Asian committee said squards from Portland, Tacoma, and Vancouver B.C. are committed to play. Representatives from San Francisco and Los Angeles are also expected to join the Seattle teams to round out the tournament's field.


Pac-Asian Inc. is a private, non-profit organization responsible for the yearly event. This group is not the same as Nisei Veterans Committee. Pac-Asian sponsors teams in various basketball leagues, whereas the Nisei Veterans sponsor basketball leagues in Seattle.


Asian students to hold benefit film showings


Two Japanese films with English subtitles will be shown at the Toyo Cinema March 24, 25, and 26 to raise money for the University of Washington's Asian Student Association (ASA).


The two films are ""Woman Gambler's Revenge"" and ""Zotoichi On the Road."" The admission price is $2.50; tickets can be purchased at the Equal Opportunity Program, Asian Division office in Schmitz Hall or at the Minority Affairs Commission in the HUB.


The film showing will begin 6 p.m. each night. For more information, call 543-9242 or 543-4727.


Asian receives Civil Service Commission award


Robert M. Nishimoto, of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, received the Commission's second highest award last month in Washington, D.C. Nishimoto received the ""Special Citation of Official Praise and Commendation Award,"" given in recognition of outstanding professional achievement and valuable contributions to Commission's programs.


As Office Service Supervisor, Nishimoto is responsible for purchasing and maintaining all supplies for the Seattle Region, U.S. Civil Service Commission. The award recognizes the outstanding service provided to the Seattle Region, his support of special hiring and equal opportunity programs, and his exceptional leadership as a supervisor.


Nishimoto has been a federal employee for over 31 years.


Thomas G. McCarthy, Director of the Commission's Seattle Region, said: ""Bob joined the Civil Service Commission in 1961 following service with the Department of the Army. His sense of responsibility and dedication over the years have earned him the respect and confidence of his fellow employees. His diligence, initiative and hard work are a sterling example of the high caliber of professionalism found among Federal employees.

The International District Community Health Center (IDCHC) was established in 1975 to serve the International District's low income elderly residents. Since then, the center has grown to serve Asians who live throughout King County.


On December 4, the center held a potluck dinner to celebrate its third anniversary and its newly expanded staff and facilities.


During the past year, IDCHC added new staff to better serve the Asian communities. The new staff includes: two administrators, one discharge planner, five outreach workers (a Filipino, Korean, Laotian, Samoan and Vietnamese). One new laboratory and four examination rooms have been added.


The Health Clinic is located at 416 Maynard Avenue South. It is expanding its services by sending outreach staff throughout King County.


Approximately 60 per cent of the patients speak little or no English. The Health Center staff not only is able to speak 10 different languages, but also use culturally sensitive approaches to medical care delivery.


The Clinic's services include primary health care such as medical diagnosis and treatment. The clinic provides 7,000 medical visits of this type per year. It also has outreach services including: home care, hospital discharge planning, follow-up and co-ordination of referrals for specialized services.


The clinic has blood pressure screening sessions throughout the community. since the large majority of its patients are elderly people, the bilingual health education sessions emphasize preventive health care and health maintenance for chronic health conditions such as: hypertension, diabetes and respiratory problems. In addition, in the interest of younger patients, the clinic offers classes on family planning, immunization and nutrition.


The women's clinic is well received. This service is supervised by a certified women's health care specialist. The focus is on gynecological problems, family planning and sexuality counseling.


The IDCHC works with other Asian agencies to meet the special needs of patients. For example, the Asian Counseling and Referral Service provides support services for mental health and social service problems.


The Clinic works hand-in-hand with local hospitals, the Seattle/King County Public Health Department and Public Health Service. The National Health Service Corp. provides a half-time doctor and a full-time practitioner plus volunteer doctors. No one is refused service because of lack of funds. To determine how much a patient pays, the clinic uses a sliding scale based on income and family size.


Jon Nakagawara, the director of the Health clinic, stated that the clinic staff works closely with the other agencies to improve the community. The health clinic supports the recent protest against the building of the Union Station Transportation center. The potential air pollution, noise pollution and traffic congestion are hazardous to the health of the district's residents, said Nakagawara.


Nakagawara also set a few goals such as to: (1) hire more foreign trained professionals to help the center; (2) be an advocate to patients; (3) help career and social services agencies reach out to the younger population.

On May 3 the lights went out for Spencer Kim, owner of the Korea Center Market in the International District. That afternoon, a Seattle City Light employee came to his business, which opened in November, to request payment of a light bill close to $2000. Kim had sent them a check to cover the debt, but it was returned by Seattle First National Bank marked ""not sufficient funds,"" he said.


By the next day, however, after the story was covered by a local television station and Kim picketed the City Light Building, the power was turned back on for a 24-hour emergency period.


The power was restored because City Light had received indications the bill would be paid in full or part, said Hugh McIntosh, public information manager for Seattle City Light.


""We had indications from the bank and Mr. Kim's attorney that they would make a deposit,"" he said.


The problems with the payment began last year when construction of the building met unforeseen delays which raised the costs by several thousand dollars, Kim explained. Because of the additional expenses Kim filed for Chapter 11 proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Act.


Under those proceedings, the debtor and the creditors collaborate on a method of repaying past debts, explained Tom Glover, Kim's attorney.


Seattle-First had agreed to loan Kim more money, if he would place all his receipts in a bank-controlled account. Upon request, the bank would then transfer money into a general account from which Kim could pay his monthly debts.


The check to Seattle City Light was drawn off the general account; however, the bank impounded those funds before the check was cashed. Neither Doug Rogers, the loan officer who handled the case, or Glover would comment on the reasons for the impoundment. Kim expressed total surprise at the turn of events which led to his power shut-off.


City Light made every effort to avoid turning them off, McIntosh said, and had notified Kim the week prior to the cut-off date. Kim, however, denies knowing about the cancellation until the day before the disconnection and claims he didn't have enough time to notify his attorney to locate the money.


During the 24-hour period, the store lost a few thousand dollars of perishable food and business, Kim said. Although the store remained open by candlelight many customers turned around when they saw the darkened interior, he said.


The Market is part of the Korea Center, a building which also houses the Seattle/Washington State Korean Association and the Korean Community Services Center.


The center was constructed to meet the needs of Korean immigrants who were stranded in a city which didn't provide them with the necessary services to deal with the language and cultural barriers, explained Kim, who is also a free-lance trade consultant.


If the center was successful, other Koreans could enjoy the success he has found, Kim said.


""I'm not against the capitalist system . . . I own a Mercedes. I live in a $150,000 house in Normandy Park. But it took me 15 years to get it. Perhaps they could do it in 10.""


At press time City Light, Seattle-First, Kim and his attorney were still negotiating the terms of payment. Meanwhile, the lights remained on and The Korea Center Market was open as usual.

Seattle School District and PTSA representatives met late last month at Franklin High School to discuss the inequality between Southeast and Northend school facilities and programs.


Margaret Chow, zone administrator, responded that there is a ""tight budget."" Pat Moyer of Fiscal Management added that the District depends on the state legislature passing the ""basic skills bill"" and voter approval of the February school levy.


Karen Hoge and Sandra Sumi of the Franklin PTSA, stated that an extremely high percentage of the District's budget is allocated to non-instructional management areas. Also, they said, the instructional and school building budgets are always the first to be cut back. They said there are 20 small schools (with less than 200 students) that seemed to impact the budget adversely.


Robert Andrews, zone administrator, said the District is in the process of consolidating programs. Hal Reasby, associate superintendent, said the District is continuously ""assessing problems and correcting them for the next year.""


Some parents point out that consolidation of programs often affects the quality of programs. For example, the Human Relations staff were also given responsibility for conflict intervention. During the middle of a human relations in-service session, two of the trainers had to leave to respond to a disturbance at a different school.


Suzanne Hittman, School Board member, also raised the concern that ""many minority impacted schools may be closed because of low enrollment. The District must be able to improve their student transfer policy because we should not just close the Southeast schools.""


""It's a continuous cycle,"" said Ben Canada, Franklin High School principal. ""We do not get the students; then we lose staff and programs because of low enrollment; and then students do not want to transfer into the school because of no programs.""


Audrey Nakanishi, Columbia Elementary School parent, said, ""According to the School District, the Southend schools involved in the desegregation plan are below their projected enrollment. That affects the programs offered at these smaller schools by cutting back on the budget.""


In response to why Northend schools Ballard and Roosevelt have more than the projected number of students, Dan Riley of Student Placement Office, said, ""There were regulations that the students automatically qualified so that they could remain at those schools. We are looking at revising some of those regulations. However, we reviewed the medical requests and they were acceptable.""


However, one former Franklin High student said the District has ""historically neglected the Southeast schools."" Another parent added, ""We want equal educational opportunities. It might be good on paper, but we want some action.""

The City Hearing Examiner recently ruled against a petition to remove an area from the jurisdiction of the International District Special Review Board, but also called upon the Board to formulate specific development proposals for the area.


M. Margaret Klockars, City Deputy Hearing Examiner, recommended denial of the petition to remove a three-block area bounded by Yesler Way (north), Fourth Avenue S. (west), the central free-way (east), and South Washington (south).


Klockars' ruling was surprising since her findings favored the petitioners.


The Seattle City Council will study the recommendation when it makes the final ruling on the issue. The Council is not expected to act on it until late October.


The recommendation states: ""The petition should be denied but the ISRD (International Special Review District) plans for the property and the application of certain development regulations with specific reference to parking, should be reviewed within a time period to be determined by the City Council.""


The petitioners didn't appeal the ruling during the 14-day appeal period. ""We feel we've made our point,"" said Ed Burke, one of the petitioners. ""The Hearing Examiner essentially agreed with everything we were stating.""


The petitioners' failure to appeal insures a City Council decision to keep the disputed area in the Special Review District, both Diane Sugimura, Review Board chairperson, and Tom Brockmiller, Review Board staff person agreed.


The ruling came as a surprise, Burke said, but it is ""the exception rather than the rule to ever decrease control on any area. It's against human nature not to want to mess with someone else's business.""


A major concern, according to Klockars, is that there are no ""specific plans for development of the subject property"" or plans ""to encourage employment for area residents.""


""Re-establishment of the ID as a stable residential neighborhood could be served by protecting the subject property from other development,"" Klockars said in her findings. But she added that ""attention and plans are currently focused on rehabilitation and development of the more central area of the District rather than the periphery (the disputed area).""


Thopetitioners had objected against the Special Review District Development Regulations requirement to phase out parking lots by January 1981. Parking lots occupy most of the disputed area. Klockars concluded that ""the reasonableness of the closing of lots needed for the (central) business district with minimal effect on the IDSRD and for which no other plans are offered is...questionable.""


Howard Pruzan, representing MTP Building Corp. (one of the petitioners), said that if his property were used as a parking lot, ""How in the hell can it hurt the District? All it will do is to help the parking problem.""


The Special Review Board, Pruzan said, is imposing a 'military dictatorship"" in the ID. ""There's no reason that I can see...why our freedom of action should be restricted. There's no question the restrictions imposed by the International Special Review District have lessened the value of property. We are simply being hurt with no redeeming value to us.""


Sugimura said, ""I can under stand some of those things the petitioners are objecting to. In light of the findings, the next time that the petition is filed. I would think...they will probably get it granted.


""I don't want to see the area out of the Special Review District,"" she continued. ""The Board will have to take a closer look at the development regulations,"" In particular, she said, the Board will have to examine potential development of the area, parking and signing.


According to Brockmiller, staff member of the City's Department of Community Development, there is money in the City's 1979 budget for someone to work on development regulation revisions. A possibility, he said, is hiring a half-time staff person to work on the problem with both the Special Review Board and the newly-appointed I.D. Project Manager.

Sharon Maeda says she ""likes to organize."" She will be fully utilizing her talents as the new general manager of KRAB, Public Broadcasting Radio (107.7 FM).


Maeda was formerly director of community involvement at KCTS Channel 9 where she also produced a weekly news show. Maeda grew frustrated at this job. She wanted to be ""responsive to the community,"" yet she felt there was an incongruency between what the local community, especially minorities, asked for and the programs aired.


Maeda also disliked wading through the bureaucratic red tape which seemed to pervade KCTS. On the other hand, she noted, at KRAB, ""the station can move as fast or as slow as we are.""


Foremost on Maeda's list of things to do as general manager is finding a new office for the radio station. She likened the present location to ""a bombed out tenement."" She said the present setting is often ""bad for the morale"" of employees. She aims to have a new address for KRAB by this September.


The financial status of KRAB is another major clean-up chore for Maeda. The station has had a long history of financial instability. With the hiring of a new business manager who is making sense out of the previously sporadic bookkeeping practices, Maeda is confident KRAB will be able to establish a more secure financial footing.


One of the most positive features of KRAB radio is its format. A glance at the monthly schedule of programs indicates that there is, as Maeda stated, ""something for everybody."" Listeners can tune into just about anything: jazz, women's issues, poetry readings, City Council news, ""Krabettes"" (a show produced by and for young children), or science news. A myriad of special productions are aired including, for example: a discussion on what happens when urban dwellers suffer continual and widespread boredom; ""How to Start Your Own Revolution""; an interview with the author of a book on prenatal care. Also, nine different programs are aired regularly in foreign languages, including Cantonese and Spanish. This, Maeda commented, is why KRAB can be viewed as a ""real alternative"" radio station.


KRAB is unique in other ways. The public is welcome to broadcast its own shows as long as the content is ""within reason."" It is not necessary to know how to produce a show, as long as you are willing to learn. The staff is ready and willing to help out with the technicalities.


""I am becoming more and more concerned about how little access we have to the media,"" said Maeda. KRAB, she feels, offers one way to be heard, through public input. Its programming can reflect the needs and interests of the local community, she said.


Such public involvement has a pleasant side effect, Maeda said. When people are responsible for their own productions, they put more care into them. Approximately 160 volunteer producers work alongside the ""dedicated"" full-time staff. Maeda said many of these people are so committed to an issue or interest that their productions are an integral part of their lives.


Maeda admitted there are groups who have not been represented on KRAB programming. She cited the Black community and the Asian community. Thus far, she said, programming has been the result of people who ""found KRAB."" Once the station has gained stability, Maeda would like to begin community ""outreach"" to actively search out groups which have had little voice in the media.


Maeda is optimistic about radio, although it has remained ""dormant"" since the advent of television and ""hasn't moved forward since those days."" Radio can make progress, Maeda believes, when people realize that some things presently aired over television are more adaptable to radio. Talk shows, for example, can be very boring to watch since television relies mostly on visuals. On shows with such a format, there is little action and movement.


Maeda ""grew up mostly with radio,"" since her parents disliked television. She recalled being very disappointed with the portrayal of characters whom she had heard so often on radio; she had envisioned them differently. Maeda said television has mesmerized today's young people. She said TV doesn't help viewers use their imagination. Nor do the numerous commercials allow them to develop their concentration span. Maeda is hopeful that more people will rediscover radio, especially as a vehicle to ""retrain (us) to think.""

""The opera is not over until the fat lady sings,"" says Dick Motta, coach of the Washington Bullets.


Donna Uno, 24, is no fat lady -- but she does sing opera. She recently graduated the University of Washington with two bachelor of arts degrees, in art and in music.


""Stereotypes are no longer true,"" says Donna, ""the fat lady (who) sets down her feet in one place and sings."" Opera involves music and acting, she says. It is called a performing art. She thinks if people had more opportunities to see opera, there would be more enhancement and enjoyment of opera.


She has only one professional experience, working in the ACT production The Me Nobody Knows, a folk rock musical about 10 ghetto kids in N.Y. She sang and acted. Her other performances have been at community affairs, most recently, on the Day of Remembrance in Puyallup.


Her musical career began in the fourth grade playing the violin. She took lessons for four years. In high school, feeling a void in her life and still appreciating music, she began taking voice lessons at Cornish. She knew she liked to sing.


She tries to vocalize every day though, she says, she doesn't practice enough. ""Music is very personal to me,"" Uno says. She has also studied briefly at the American Institute of Musical Studies in Austria.


It is a difficult art, she acknowledges, and there are ups and downs, but ""I won't quit until I've really tried, (and it) doesn't make me happy anymore."" Some have told her it was advantageous to be Asian, since there are quite a few Japanese opera singers in Europe. But it is a predominantly white field and there is great competition.


Not ready to embark on her opera singer career yet, she plans to continue her schooling and get her Masters. She wants to go to a good school, probably out-of-state as soon as she gets her finances together. Presently, she works at a sporting goods store.


Aspiring, she is. She seeks a career in the theater. She likes the ""feeling of creating"" that goes along with performing. She laughs jokingly, ""I love attention!""

When the Seattle City Council approved the 1979 budget for city operations on December 1, it in effect dismantled the city's central policy planning unit, the Office of Policy Planning (OPP).


At press time, the Mayor's office had worked out a compromise proposal to retain the Office of Policy Planning and had submitted it to the City Council. According to Arlene Oki of the Mayor's office, the proposal, which would be offered as an amendment to the budget, would eliminate 12 positions from OPP, 10 of which are presently unfilled, and call for two transfers within the department. The cost savings would be $300,000, she said. Oki said the Mayor's office feels it has the votes necessary to pass the compromise. The Council was scheduled to vote on the compromise December 18.


It was created during the Wes Uhlman administration as part of the executive or mayoral department. OPP has developed the city's comprehensive policy goals, such as housing strategies, and aided community development through initiation of specific projects, such as community block grant funding.


However, the City Council has become increasingly dissatisfied with the office, culminating in a $730,000 cut from the Office and elimination of 30 staff positions.


The Council's decision could hurt present and future International District projects. Doug Chin, a housing strategist in OPP, believes that OPP, in providing technical assistance and allocating money for community projects, was particularly fair to the International District. ""We had Asian planners working in the office who really pushed for projects in the International District,"" Chin said. ""Since we were all in one office, it was easy to provide input on different aspects of a particular project such as housing or human resources. Although not all projects were funded in the I.D., I feel that Jackie Lum, Diane Sugimura, Ken Nakatsu, myself and other Asians who worked here had our say in the allocation process.""


Chin feels the impact Asian planners had on development of International District programs will be lost. He said the City Council proposal to shift the remaining OPP staff to different city departments will slow the planning process, create power plays between the different city departments (such as the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Community Development, and the Department of Human Resources), and make it harder to get International District projects funded.


""When you have all the planners in one office, organizations in the International District could work with one office in developing their programs,"" he said. ""Now, if that office is dismantled and its staff scattered, those organizations are going to have some difficulty because they have to deal with different city departments on a different variety of levels. We (Asian planners) won't have as much impact on the planning process when we are all scattered to different departments.""


Barbara Dingfield, director of OPP, felt the City Council decision came at a particularly bad time in terms of planning for the future of community development in the International District. The federal government, she said, had designated the International District a ""Neighborhood Strategy Area,"" requiring special emphasis on developing specific development goals for this community.


With the elimination of the central planning office and 30 staff positions, Dingfield doesn't feel the city can provide the technical assistance to the I.D. that it could have if OPP continued operating. As an example, she said OPP had five staff people working on housing strategies, including development of goals for low income housing and rehabilitation. The City Council proposal eliminates three of those positions. Development of housing strategies, not only for the I.D. but for the City will be the responsibility of only two planners. Dingfield said particular community housing needs will probably not be given the attention they deserve because there won't be staff to do it.


As the central policy planning unit, the Office of Policy Planning became one of the most powerful city departments. Dolores Sibonga, who voted with the 6-3 majority to dismantle OPP, said the Office had become an unresponsive bureaucracy with a $3 million budget. She said she voted against funding OPP to make the Office of Policy Planning more ""accountable and accessible to the City Council and the neighborhoods."" She felt the City Council, as a whole, was not against the idea of centralized policy planning. But she, for one, didn't like the way OPP was presently run. For a number of years, she said, the City Council wanted OPP to be more receptive. Sibonga mentioned that two of the council members who voted to dismantle OPP had previously requested technical assistance in developing comprehensive plans for Parks and for Transportation, but that OPP was unable to meet the request.


The Office of Policy Planning, as an executive department, is largely responsible to the mayor. The three council members who voted to retain OPP had good relationships with that office. However, Sibonga said the Council felt powerless as the Office of Policy Planning grew in power and, correspondingly, so did the executive department. She thought the Office of Policy Planning was exceeding its authority -- doing more than providing technical assistance to community groups but telling them what to do. The only check the Council had on OPP was to cut the budget, she said.


Sibonga is not opposed to centralized planning. She had hoped the mayor would offer a compromise measure which would ""streamline"" the office and provide for more effective communication with the Council. She pointed out, for example, that 30 percent of OPP's operating budget was for administration. But, she said, the mayor's attitude appears to be that they can't do with less than what they had.


Arlene Oki, one of the mayor's aides said Royer has no immediate plans to reorganize the Office of Policy Planning. But she said Royer is firmly committed to the concept of centralized planning because it is virtually impossible to run a city the size of Seattle without it. What Royer does . . . to do, said Oki, is to get ""heavy community involvement"" to develop a more responsive central planning unit. Oki said the mayor has heard from community groups which didn't like the way the City Council acted . . . dismantling OPP. There was no public review and the community groups had little say in how the Office of Policy Planning was dismantled, she said.


The City Council action to shift OPP . . . to different city departments has been criticized. Doug Chin noted that responsibility for Community Block Grant Funds has been given to the City's Office of Management and Budget. It will be extremely difficult, he said, for community groups to establish contact with an office that has had little to do with community organizations. Oki mentioned that initially the City Council had planned to shift the Law and Justice Planning Department of OPP to the Police Department until the Law and Justice Planners threatened to quit if this was done. Now it's a separate department. Chin feels the City Council dismantling of OPP was not well thought out. Costs haven't been considered, responsibilities and duties not spelled out, he said, and it's not clear how the city departments which will receive the planning staff are going to employ them.


Chin described OPP as a ""pawn in the power play between Royer and the City Council."" To preserve the Office of Policy Planning, Royer would probably have to veto the Council's budget vote. In the last few days before the Council vote, Sibonga was heavily lobbied by the mayor's office for a favorable vote. She, nonetheless, voted with the majority. However, Sibonga has had her last vote. She gave up her appointed office to newly-elected Norm Rice on the day of the budget vote. If Royer does veto the budget, the Council would need a two-thirds majority to override the veto. And if the veto is sustained, the budget could be tied up and all city operations affected.


Community groups view the battle over OPP with ambivalence. Sibonga mentioned that she heard complaints by some community groups, such as the Seahaven Hostel and the Wallingford Community, that OPP was not very responsive. The Office of Policy Planning has played a big role in getting I.D. projects funded, specifically the Asian Counseling and Referral Service, the Community Center, the Health Clinic, and some Inter*im projects. But Dan Rounds of Inter*im said he has had trouble relating to some of the upper echelon at OPP. He would like to see OPP become more accountable to community groups by having planners directly tied to community groups rather than to the city. He would like to see OPP continue but not in its present form.


Although one of the complaints against OPP was that it was not responsive to community groups, the Office was dismantled without little community input. Barbara Dingfield said that when OPP was created, there were public hearings, but none when it was dissolved. The Council's vote caught both the mayor's office and OPP offguard. Neither expected the Council to take the action it did. But Sibonga said the problems with the Office have been well-known.


Dingfield noted that many of the criticisms against OPP have merit. When an agency has a large staff and a budget, the bureaucracy is inherent. She admits that OPP could be streamlined and feels the agency would probably be better off if it were smaller. In addition, Dingfield admits the Office of Policy Planning staff doesn't spend as much time as it should in the community.


In planning the future of Seattle's communities, it seems coordinated policy planning is essential. One of the biggest obstacles appears to be a communication breakdown between the Office of Policy Planning, the City Council, the Mayor's Office, and community organizations. Most of the parties involved agree that if the Office of Policy Planning is to continue, changes must be made so OPP becomes more accessible and accountable. There is argument whether the City Council action makes the problems worse.

A textile master from Japan is at the University of Washington to share with students dyeing techniques that have been family secrets for several hundred years.


Okawahara Shizuo, the textile master, is teaching a class in dyeing techniques and two classes in East Asian calligraphy at the University this quarter.


The Okawahara family has owned and operated a fabric-dyeing studio in the city of Takamatsu on Shikoku Island for at least three hundred years. The studio began as a dyeing shop which specialized in making fabrics for kimono, using block-printing, stenciling and batiking methods. Flags, mattress covers, and norem (short curtains hung at the doorways and windows and over the counters of shops and eating places in Japan) were also made.


The work of the Okawahara family displayed a distinctive style, with an entire repertoire of forms and original family designs. Their style of dyeing and printing became so well-known and highly respected it came to be called Sanuki-zome (""Sanuki"" being the former name for Shikiku, and ""zome"" being a form of the Japanese word for dyeing -- someru) -- the epitome of the dyeing style of the region.


Okawahara Shizuo is also a master calligrapher. Calligraphy has been used in the designs of Japanese dyers for a long time. The close parallels between calligraphic techniques and designing by wax on cloth make the transference of the designs of one to the other a natural.


Within the past hundred years, all the family members involved in the Okawahara studio have specialized in calligraphy. Employment of assistants in the dyeing shops has freed the masters from secondary tasks and made it possible for the masters to devote their time to calligraphy and design. Today, good dyers are also good calligraphers.


Much early design was printed in indigo blue and white. Colors were made from bark, leaves, and various parts of different vegetation before the invention of chemical dyes in the 19th century. With industrialization, chemical dyes replaced natural dyes in many Japanese dyeing shops. More colors came into use and new dyeing methods were adopted to facilitate mass production.


Today, only a small fraction of Japan's dyers still work in traditional methods, using mainly natural dyes. To a large extent, the Okawahara studio has preserved traditional techniques and retained the use of natural colors. This, although natural dyes are much more expensive than chemical dyes and appear no different to the layperson. In addition, only fabric made from natural fibers such as cotton, silk and linen is used in the studio.


Since the folk art movement of the 1930's and 40's in Japan, there has been a great deal of renewed interest in traditional fabric design. A gradual renaissance of traditional dyeing techniques has taken place. As a result, the work of Okawahara Shizuo is very much admired and sought after.


Mr. Okawahara, himself, sees his work more as craft that art. He looks upon the end-products of his meticulous labor as useful objects rather than works of art.


Most of his work is done on commission and for commercial purposes. For example, a recent series of banners he designed was commissioned by a Japanese car-manufacturer to be used on car lots to attract sales. Okawahara feels he cannot be a purist about his work as art, even though today he works primarily as a designer, cooperating with shops which specialize in making dyes. In the past, the family studio handled dye-making as well as designing and printing.


Many consider Okawahara's products works of art. But, in most instances, it is not his intent to create works of art when he designs, he says. Frequently he draws upon the family repertoire of images for his work. Occasionally he receives commissions which specify the use of totally original design. Only then, does he think of himself as an artist because such requests call for creative energy. The final results are, he says, more truly artistic.


An exhibit of his works is scheduled to open December 7 at the Greenwood Galleries in Pioneer Square. The art show is a special event for Okawahara. His works have never been shown to be sold as art objects in Japan.


Some of the works in this exhibit have been specially made for the occasion. Okawahara said these works may be considered art. But he considers the major purpose of the exhibit educational and certain pieces of work were done basically to demonstrate some of his techniques.


At one time these techniques were family secrets as was the tradition among dyers' families. But television has invaded the Okawahara studio and broadcasted his methods to the country. Even then, teaching large classes is something new to Okawahara. Limited training is usually given as the master prepares his son or sons to take over his studio. Customarily, training begins at an early age -- as soon as a child can hold a brush he starts learning calligraphy. Other training soon follows.


A person trained in the profession is expected to devote all his time to it. That is why, according to Okawahara, girls are never trained to become dyers, since women are tied down with housework and taking care of their families and would not have time for the profession. Familes not blessed with sons adopt boys to carry on the work.


Okawahara's works will be at the Greenwood Galleries for five weeks.

Every day people come into Inter*im to open new bank accounts, open their mail, get new eye prescriptions, coffee, potluck lunches, and use the bathroom, and more. And here are the rest of the things that Inter*im does: It's a nonprofit community-action agency governed by a Board of Directors elected by the community. Funds to operate Inter*im and its programs come from the Community Services Administration (CSA) through Neighborhood House, Comprehensive Employment and Training Program (CETA) and revenues from Inter*im Parking Lot. CSA annual funding totals $30,000 and covers salaries for two full-time staff, one part-time accountant and all operating costs. Actually, this is a very tight budget but we cope with it. The CETA staff coordinate the following programs:


The I.D. Community Garden, which took one year to construct, is a terraced garden enjoyed by elderly farmers. The entire city is proud of it, and marveling at the tremendous support, donated money, material and labor totaling over $37,000, not to mention the property donated by Wilma and Danny Woo. The garden serves Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Black and Caucasian residents of the I.D. A $2,776 mini-grant was awarded from the Hunger Action Center last year to initiate the project.


The I.D. Food Buying Club enables low-income, elderly residents to order dry food stuffs at wholesale prices once a month. This is to assist them with a better diet at great savings. Companies assisting us are: Uwajimaya's SEASIA and Tsue Chong Inc. A mini-grant from CSA of $3800 covers operating expenses.


The Milwaukee Hotel symbolizes what community action can do to save our housing in the I.D. It would have been the 30th hotel to close down had the tenants and broader community not intervened to keep it open. Inter*im and the I.D. Housing Alliance now manage the hotel, make day-to-day repairs, and, along with the tenants, we are now working on a strategy to buy the hotel from its present owners. In addition, Inter*im, the Housing Alliance and a core of supporters provide a daily, 24-hour fire aid security watch at the hotel. This exemplifies the serious commitment generated around this project. The hotel is the home for Chinese, Caucasian, and Japanese low-income residents.


The I.D. Day Care Center will provide services for children of the I.D. restaurant and garment factory workers, most of whom don't speak English. The age group served ranges from one to five years old. This is a critically-needed program. Partial funding of $16,000 has come from Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and community donations.


The I.D. Parking Association, of which Inter*im is a member, recently decided that parking lots in the District should be operated and maintained by the community and for the community. Our philosophy is that revenue should be shared for I.D. programs as opposed to profits being gobbled up by large parking lot conglomerates. Inter*im runs the largest parking lot in the District (170 stalls). Revenues over the last year went to the construction of our garden and to repairs in the Milwaukee Hotel to keep the place open. The parking plan is designed to become self-sufficient in one year.


Inter*im staff also operate the Emergency Meal Voucher Program which is into its fourth year. This program provides meals for our elderly at the critical time, during the last week of every month, when meager social security and other income runs out. This program serves all qualifying elderly residents of the District. The annual budget is $36,000. Funding comes from CDBG and serves an average of 380 persons per month.


Inter*im assisted in securing the 99 units of low-income housing to be built next month at Maynard South and South Weller Streets with the express purpose of serving the needs of the ""Chinatown/International District"" community. We took the cue from countless elderly demanding better housing. Our well-documented, well-organized demand also resulted in another 99 units scheduled to be built at Sixth South and South Main Streets. Groundbreaking ceremonies are scheduled for March 14.


Inter*im and the Housing Alliance are responsible for the repeal of a compliance agreement placed on the International Terrace Apartments by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This agreement forced the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) to restrict minority residency to 35 per cent at the International Terrace. This meant any new vacancies would be given to ""Caucasians only"" until the level of minority occupancy decreased to 35 per cent. The minority and non-minority applicants were placed on separate lists. After several non-productive meetings with the HUD regional office, we decided that we would take a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with higher level HUD officials. Once there, we explained our reasons for opposing this compliance agreement. HUD agreed and awarded the Terrace an exemption from the agreement. To quote HUD Secretary Chester McGuire: ""To preserve the ethnic heritage in neighborhoods like the International District, the HUD guidelines must be more flexible . . .""


Beyond service programs, Inter*im was centrally involved in establishing the International District/Chinatown Public Corporation, the I.D. Community Center to be built at the Bush Hotel, and the Title VII Chinese Nutrition Program. We can proudly say that all these projects total approximately $10 million developed over the last three years.


In conclusion, we'd like to mention two things. First, it is sad that we still hear criticisms that ""Inter*im doesn't serve everyone."" If after reading our summary, these criticisms persist, we question the sources' motivations. The second point is that misconceptions surround our ability to get funding for our projects. People believe that funds flow towards us like a waterfall. This is totally erroneous. In fact we've had to scratch and shove for what funding we have gotten. The needs always surpass what Inter*im is able to provide for the District. Everyone knows that successful programs aren't ""packaged and served on silver platters."" Inter*im thanks all who've helped us for another prosperous year in service to all the people of the International District.

Roy Flores can reflect on his tenure on the Washington State Human Rights Commission with a sense of achievement and a sigh of relief. For over five years, Flores devoted 20 to 30 hours a month reviewing discrimination cases and helping set directions for the human rights agency.


Flores, 29 at the time he was appointed by former Governor Evans, was the youngest commissioner to serve on that board. He was also the first Asian American on that commission.


""I can remember being very excited about the opportunity to serve,"" Flores said. ""It was the era of Pan-Asian involvement then. The appointment meant that an Asian would be visible on that Commission, in the civil rights struggle, and that I could provide an Asian perspective regarding those issues.""


Factors associated with Asians such as citizenship status, weight, height, bilingual capabilities, and English speaking abilities were overlooked by the Commission before Flores arrived.


Flores's influence on the agency was no more dramatic than in its hiring of Asian American staff. The number of staff jumped from zero to ten during his term including an Asian deputy director.


Another highlight Flores can point to is the Commission's study of redlining, the practice of denying mortgage loans to certain geographical areas. The board's redlining task force, which Flores headed, substantiated that such practices exist and made recommendations to restrict them. It also found that the problem went beyond lending institutions and included real estate and insurance companies as well.


The commission hearings in Yakima, Flores said, was another accomplishment. The shooting of a Black youth by a white police officer at a local market led to an investigation of the Yakima Police Department.


The market hired off-duty policemen, who suspected every Black customer of being a shoplifter. Consequently, every Black who entered the store was searched, which the Commission found discriminatory. The Commission then instructed the Police Department to conduct in-service training, appoint Black officers, and conduct searches only where there are valid reasons.


Those were some of the more rewarding experiences, Flores said. There were times when the lives of commissioners can become pretty risky, even to the point of becoming threatened.


Flores remembered the time when an insistent complainant, whom the Commission had decided against, drew a hand gun at them. ""I just tried to be cool,"" he recalled. The police eventually removed the person from the room where the Commission was meeting.


Another instance was when a Jewish complainant threatened the board by showing them his gun permit -- and his apparently loaded pistol. ""He thought the world was against Jews and that the Commission had conspired against him because we did not decide in his favor,"" Flores said.


In the years he served as a commissioner, the agency went through significant changes.


""When I first began, our clientele was mostly minorities,"" Flores said. ""Now, the majority of the agency cases involve discrimination complaints based on sex in employment or credit.""


The women's movement, he said, has generated many cases. Most of them are filed by white, middle-class lawyers and professionals, who know about the laws and the system.


""The Commission caters too much to the professional and companies,"" he added. ""By merely holding all our meetings from 8 to 5, we conveniently serve them and not the blue-collar and unemployed workers.""


Another difference he observed while on the Commission is the growing sophistication of discrimination among the businesses and other employers. They now know what they cannot overtly do, he said.


At the same time, the job as a human rights investigator has become increasingly specialized. To detect subtle discrimination, knowledge of civil rights laws and personnel principles as well as human relations skills are necessary.


Last December, six months after his original term had ended, Flores read in the newspaper that he was going to be replaced on the Commission. His replacement: a physically handicapped white businessman and a strong supporter of Governor Dixy Lee Ray.


""Governor Evans looked at potential commissioners, regardless of their political affiliation, and what they could contribute to the agency,"" he said.


While a commissioner, Flores unsuccessfully advocated the appointment of a Native American. That group has never had representation on the Commission, he said.


The Commission now consists of a Black woman, two white males, and a white female. The make-up, he said, reflects the conservative backlash, which is occurring nationally, and complacency on the part of minorities.


Everyone should realize that discrimination exists as much now as in the past, he added. ""My message to those in advocacy positions and the civil rights movement is don't become complacent. We still have a ways to go.""

Mich Matsudaira, former executive director of the Washington State Commission for Asian-American Affairs, says appointments to the Commission and the directorship have become too political. Well known and reputable Asians are out to destroy the Commission, he adds.


Matsudaira resigned last November. He plans to open ""Mich's Mens Shop,"" at 662 South Jackson Street in mid March.


Matsudaira said he resigned fom the Commission primarily because of the Dixy Lee Ray Administration's tactics of doing away with or changing the commission and its plan to fire him from the director position.


""The job environment was really getting to me,"" Matsudaira said. ""I like government. It has always been a part of me, but by the end of the year, I felt it was a good time to leave. I was going to be fired anyway."" Both the Commission and the directorship were becoming political pawns, according to Matsudaira.


""I tried to keep the position non-political,"" he said. ""To me, the (director) position should always have been non-political. The members were non-political. Partisan type issues and candidates were always avoided during my years as director. But for all appearances, the Commission has become a political appointment and the director is going to become a political appointment.


""You can see what happens when 10 to 20 individuals are all politically appointed. It becomes a political power base for some group or some individual."" Matsudaira thinks the director, as well, cannot function as the voice for Asians in government if he becomes a political appointment.


Matsudaira had been the Commission's executive director since 1972. The Commission was formally established in the Governor's office by the State Legislature in February, 1974. The previous two years it had been the Governor's Asian American Advisory Council.


The Commission was established ""to examine and define issues pertaining to the rights and needs of Asian-Americans and to make recommendations to the governor and state agencies with respect to desirable changes in programs and laws."" The office has achieved a number of successes; one of the most notable is its key role in the preparation to rescind Executive Order 9066 which interned 110,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans in relocation camps during World War II.


The Commission has 24 members, all appointed by the governor under the following process: ""in making such appointments, the governor shall give due consideration to recommendations submitted to him by the Commission. The governor may also consider nomination of members made by the various Asian-American organizations in the state. The governor shall consider nominations for membership based upon maintaining a balance distribution of Asian-ethnic, geographic, sex, age, and occupational representation, where practicable.""


The new administration, however, has not lived up to its promise, Matsudaira said.


The Commission worked well with Dan Evans and his staff although it ""took time"" to prove that discriminatory practices existed. Evans was responsive. The result was creation of the Commission, Matsudaira said.


Under Ray's administration, however, ""it's a whole different ball of wax,"" Matsudaira said. ""It was difficult, difficult"" to try to deal with the new administration's staff. ""If Dixy had created the Commission, it would be better, but the Commission is now considered a holdover agency,"" he said.


There are now higher priorities, the Commission is being ignored for those higher priorities, according to Matsudaira. ""Our Commission is on the backburner.""


Ray has failed to officially appoint new members to the Commission since she took office in January, 1977, and the Commission currently is in ""limbo status."" According to Matsudaira, Ray had an opportunity to appoint up to 11 new members as of the end of June, 1977. This, however, was never acted upon, and the administration is not recognizing the legitimacy of existing Commission members. At least three times in 1977, the Ray administration asked the Commission to submit names of individuals to fill vacancies on the Commission. Each time the Commission responded by submitting a list of names to the governor.


""But she hasn't done anything about it,"" Matsudaira said.


""There's no sense of control, no sense of continuity,"" he said. ""The Commission would start something, but we wouldn't know if we were going to be around to finish it. In the past year the director has been the Commission,"" he said.


During the transition period, ""I was getting some very early signals that there were things in the wind to either get rid of or change the Commission."" Matsudaira said the administration wants to reorient the Commission's priorities from the grassroots issues to perhaps foreign trade, and possibly incorporating the Commission into the State Commerce Department.


""The scenario fits from everything I've heard said, that the Commission is not a good thing for the state or the administration,"" Matsudaira continued.


Matsudaira thinks Ray's attitude and neglect of the Commission are caused, in part, by a few influential Asians having gotten her attention. ""There are some Asians who are saying bad things about the Commission,"" Matsudaira said.


Despite his recent dissatisfaction with government, Matsudaira would like to see more Asians participate in government. ""Exposure to government is healthy and if given the opportunity, if more Asians were asked, more Asians would go into it,"" he said.


""It was an exciting job. There's no other agency like it. Our office probably initiated more issues related to Asian American concerns than most people realize.""


""I thought of my appointment to the director's position as a challenge. The position places that person in an area which had not existed before for Asians, that is, working with other agency heads at the state level.""


Matsudaira worked as an industrial engineer and manager for the Boeing Company before accepting the director's position with the state agency. He was active in Asian American issues both at Boeing and in the International District. ""I was working to raise the Asian consciousness inside the company while at the same time spending 20 to 30 hours a week in the I.D. involved with such groups as the JACL Social Concern Committee.""


Matsudaira intends to again become involved with community activities in the I.D. especially working to attract young professionals and businessmen back to live and work in the District. Mich's Mens Shop is his initial attempt at entrepreneurship.


""I grew up in this area,"" he said. ""The multi-ethnicity exists here as nowehere else. I look around here and I see people I grew up with who left and are now coming back to our roots."" Matsudaira's hope is for others to do the same so that the I.D. may become a viable, livable neighborhood.

They've just named a child care center after my friend, Denise Louie. It's rare that anything is named after someone who died at such a young age of twenty-one but Denise was a rare individual. Denise had gotten more out of life than many of us will ever have even if we live to 100. Rather than sit back and do nothing, Denise got involved.


For many people, Denise's name probably doesn't sound familiar except, perhaps, for the grim fact that she died in a San Francisco restaurant. But for those of us who knew what she did for the community or what she tried to do, having something named after her eases the pain of knowing she is not with us.


Many of her friends feel as I do that naming a child care center after Denise is appropriate. Kids have a lot of energy, with a tendency to get into mischief. Denise was a lot like that. She'd probably have fit right in with the kids.


A child care center has been needed in the International District for a long time. Donnie Chin of the International District Emergency Center once said: ""When their momma's away, the kids will play."" And what Donnie means by ""play"" is kids playing in the garbage cans, fighting in the alleys, and just getting into trouble because there is nothing else to do when their parents are away working. People often think of the International District as a place where only the elderly live. But immigrant families do live here. Next time you're in the District, look in the grocery stores. You'll probably see some kids hanging out.


The center will have programs designed to accomodate approximately 17 low-income children. Tentative hours will be from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The reason for the early opening hours is to accomodate garment workers who must go to work in the early morning. The child care program is intended to reach children and families who have had little contact with child care programs. These specifically include Asian immigrant children, Chinese, Filipino, and Vietnamese.


The center plans to offer programs in health care, developmental assessment, and child care guidance. Meals and snacks will be provided for. Tentative plans also include bilingual programming.


Having Denise Louie's name associated with such a needed program is a tribute to an unsung heroine. Denise donated many hours of her time to community service without expectation of glory. She volunteered her help for the community garden because she wanted to do it. She helped clean up the facilities at the Chinese Information Center for the Chinese Nutrition Program because she felt good about doing it. She worked on political campaigns for candidates supported by the community because someone had to do it. She participated in demonstrations because Asian voices had to be heard.


Naming the child care center ""the Denise Louie Child Care Center"" is the community's way, belatedly, of saying, ""Thanks, Denise.""

The future of the Seattle mandatory desegregation plan will now be decided by court of law. School District officials are attempting to make Seattle the first major city in the country to desegregate without a court order.


Initiative 350, the statewide anti-busing proposal, won by almost a two to one margin. Significantly, there was strong voter opposition to the Initiative in the University District, Central Area, and Southeast Seattle, which are directly affected by the desegregation plan.


On November 8, the School Board voted 5 to 0 to challenge the constitutionality of Initiative 350. Ellen Roe and Dorothy Hollingsworth, School Board members, were out of town and did not attend.


Robert Dorse, president of Citizens for Voluntary Integration Committee (CiVIC), described the 64 per cent voter approval of the Initiative as ""the will of the people."" He alluded to School Board praise of CiVIC proceeding in a lawful and orderly manner: ""They're representatives of the people and the people have spoken. There is no need for a lawsuit or any animosity.""


""It was in no way a vote against integration, but a vote for the concept of the neighborhood school,"" Dorse continued.


Dr. Richard Andrews, of the District-wide Advisory Committee on Desegregation, contended it was a vote for segregation. ""The School District will become hopelessly segregated,"" he said. ""The Seattle Plan started the desegregation process for quality, integrated education."" He also advised the School District to take it to ""a higher court of law, even if you go to the Supreme Court.""


The Rev. William Cate, president of the Church Council of Greater Seattle, advised the School Board to challenge the constitutionality of Initiative 350. He stated that ""we never would have desegregated our schools by a national plebiscite."" It is expected that the Church Council, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) will join the School District's effort to overturn the Initiative.


Suzanne Hittman, School Board member, added, ""For quality, integrated education, mandatory desegregation was the next logical step. A just, equitable voluntary desegregation has not had the necessary historical movement...Initiative 350 must be challenged.""


The community has expressed concern over the impact of Initiative 350 on the Seattle desegregation plan. Man Chan, community coordinator for the Coalition for Quality Integrated Education, stated that before the Seattle Plan was implemented, ""voluntary desegregation did not occur. The School District has admitted that you could rank schools by socioeconomic status and you'll have the same corresponding achievement ranking in basic skills test,"" he said. ""Colman and Columbia (both low income, predominantly minority elementary schools) scored lowest on last year's city wide test.""


Jacqueline Actuga, of the Filipino Community Council's Task Force on Education, compared the impact of the Bakke decision upon affirmative action and the potential court litigation upon desegregation. ""We must separate the problem of low quality of all schools from the inequality of minority and non-minority schools,"" she said. ""Until the two are equal, the struggle for higher quality education for all will not advance.""


Silme Domingo, chairperson of Franklin High School Bi-lingual Advisory Committee, said, ""Segregated education is unequal education, forcing minorities into a continuous cycle of ignorance and poverty. To truly desegregate the educational system, one must target housing, employment, and other social issues as well.""

The Port of Seattle earlier this month shelved its plan to construct a $17 million intermodal transportation terminal at the old Union Station site adjacent to the International District. The Port cited the unwillingness of Greyhound Bus Lines to participate in the terminal project.


Jim Dwyer, senior director of planning and port relations, told The Examiner that ""Trailways was ready, willing and able"" to participate in the terminal project, but that Greyhound ""indicated the site was not adequate to meet their needs.""


The Port had planned a complex which would house Greyhound, Trailways, Airport Bus Service, Greyline Tours and Evergreen Cascade Trailways. Amtrak would be hooked up with the complex by tunnel under 4th Avenue, under Port's proposal.


Since Greyhound Bus Lines has a large share of the market in bus travel, said Dwyer, its participation was essential.


But The Examiner has learned that the President of Greyhound notified the Port, by letter, of its decision not to participate in the Union Station scheme on November 16, about one month before the Port made its public announcement to shelve the Union Station project.


According to Seattle City Council insiders, there were at least three Council members prepared to vote against appropriation of the money the Port had sought for its planning study. That would be enough votes to block passage of funds for the study. Seven of the nine Council members would have to vote for the appropriation, since the $25,000 would come out of emergency funds.


The City Council's transportation committee had scheduled a public hearing on the transportation terminal appropriation November 22, but the hearing was rescheduled to early December, then postponed at the request of the Port. Some observers pointed out that it was a politically wise decision by the Port to shelve the transportation terminal project at this time, rather than risk defeat by the City Council.


The International District Improvement Association (Inter'Im) had spearheaded opposition to the conversion of Union Station into a transportation terminal, pointing to the traffic congestion, pollution and potential detrimental effect on housing the terminal would cause. Inter*Im had heavily lobbied the City Council.


""It's a community victory,"" stated Bob Santos, director of Inter*Im, following the Port's announcement. ""The support of the business community, residents and groups outside of the District"" was a key factor in Port's decision, he said.


Asked if the opposition from International District community had anything to do with the Port's decision, Dwyer replied that the Port had earmarked money for community participation in the planning process. Art Yoshioka, another Port representative, responded, ""I don't think so.""


Asked if the Port will formulate a different proposal for a transportation terminal, Dwyer replied, ""I don't foresee that occurring in the near future."" Yoshioka added, ""It's kind of a lost opportunity."" But, Yoshioka added, ""the basic problem won't go away -- the needs of public transit.""


A local Greyhound official declined to comment on the decision not to participate in the Port scheme. But Lee Whitehead, director of public relations for Greyhound in Phoenix, said, ""Our people looked at the site and determined it was not suitable because of the amount of traffic congestion."" The proximity of Union Station to the Kingdome would hamper access to and from the terminal, Whitehead said. He said the Union Station site could not be altered to meet the needs of Greyhound. ""We decided that it was not going to be feasible at some later time,"" Whitehead said.


Whitehead's response raises a question. The Port, in its attempt to defuse community opposition, had argued that it would study alternative uses for the Union Station site as well as alternative sites for the transportation terminal. However, according to Whitehead, the Port made the recommendation to Greyhound that the terminal be built at Union Station. ""We have not closed the door on the notion (of a transportation terminal),"" said Whitehead. ""But that particular site we will not participate in because, as a bus terminal, it is not acceptable.""


Dan Dingfield, consultant to the Port of Seattle, suggested that competition between Greyhound and Trailways might have played a role in Greyhound's decision to stay out of the Union Station terminal project. Shigeko Uno, vice-president of the International District Economic Association (IDEA), said Greyhound handles 60 per cent of the bus traffic and 995 other bus companies handle the other 40 per cent. It has been suggested that Greyhound wants to control the market. ""Fanciful speculation,"" responds Whitehead.

Last July 19, the national convention of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) met in Salt Lake City and voted unanimously to seek ""to provide cognitive redress from the United States to persons of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of whom were American citizens, and their immediate family members who, during World War II, suffered injustices by Official actions of the United States government.""


To remind our nation of the need for continued vigilance and to render less likely the recurrence of similar injustices, the JACL plans to introduce a bill to Congress to appropriate $3 billion in redress for 120,313 Japanese Americans and others of Japanese ancestry held in concentration camps between 1942 and 1946.


The main issue is not monetary -- what was lost could never be recovered -- but rather acknowledging the wrongdoing and providing proper restitution.


In memory of the years of hardship Japanese Americans suffered and endured to make the United States their home, November 25 has been proclaimed ""A Day of Remembrance"" by the city of Seattle. Among the sponsoring groups are the Pacific Northwest chapter of the JACL and the Japanese Baptist Church. This gathering of all interested persons of Japanese ancestry, their family and friends will begin 12 noon at Sicks Stadium parking lot in Seattle, where a car caravan will assemble (buses will be available for those without transportation) and proceed to Puyallup Fairgrounds, a site known 36 years ago as Camp Harmony, home to 7,200 local Japanese Americans detained by the United States government.


Upon arrival, a full day of activities and entertainment is scheduled from 2 to 9 p.m., including a tour of the former campsite, slide shows, photo exhibits. Among the guests at the Day of Remembrance are: Charles Z. Smith, Rev. Paul Nagano, Shosuke Sasaki, Dr. Minoru Masuda, Judge James Dolliver, Mayor Charles Royer, Dan Evans, Dr. Gordon Hirabayashi, Lawson Inada, Meji-kai, Mako, and the Asian Exclusion Act.


A community potluck dinner will take place at 6 p.m. and those unable to contribute are asked to call David Ishii at 622-4719 by November 18. It is suggested that participants bring a blanket, seat cushion, small tarp or ground cloth and wear clothing suitable for outdoor weather conditions.

Thirty-six years ago Gordon Hirabayashi, then just a college student, decided to hold to his convictions. He refused to go along with the mass evacuation of Japanese into internment camps. Only now, he believes, the Japanese are finally taking a similar stand and are recovering from that experience.


""To have 2,000 rank and file people on a voluntary basis seems to indicate we're finally arriving, coming out as mature citizens,"" Hirabayashi said. ""We're not just bending with the blows, we're thinking about assuming initiative on our own on behalf of the community, rather than relying on someone else to look after us.""


Hirabayashi, a native of Auburn, ""came home"" to speak at the ""Day of Remembrance"" pilgrimage in Puyallup. In an interview the following day, the professor of sociology recalled the confusing days following Pearl Harbor.


""We kept hearing these berserk newspaper and radio stories about sabotage and I kept thinking, 'It can't be true,'"" he remembers. ""But with the incessant repetition, I thought, well, there might be some cases, but of course we found out later there were no cases of sabotage or betrayal.""


Hirabayashi was living in a YMCA dormitory at the University of Washington when an 8 p.m. curfew was imposed on all Japanese in Spring, 1942. He obeyed the curfew the first week.


""One day, on the way home from the library, I thought, 'What the hell am I dashing home when my classmates were still there? What's so different?'"" he recounted. ""The only difference was race, and I said, 'This is crazy,' and turned around and went back.


""Maybe I was naive and idealistic, but that's the good thing about youth, being idealistic.""


Hirabayashi's dormmates were all white. He believes it was relatively easy for him to break the law to be with his friends.


""I wasn't deliberately violating the law, I was just living like everybody else,"" he recalls. ""I didn't have to answer to the Japanese community leaders who would have pressured me and said, 'Why are you doing this?'""


Hirabayashi was still residing at the YMCA dorm when the Japanese were evacuated from the University area in early May, 1942. He didn't want to live as a fugitive, so he turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was charged with refusing to obey military orders, and spent nine months awaiting trial in the King County jail.


""At the district court level, they're just supposed to rule on the facts,"" he said. ""The judge told the jury, 'Is this man of Japanese ancestry, and if so, did he disobey the evacuation?' Well, I am Japanese and I was still there, so they came back with a guilty verdict in less than ten minutes.""


But the whole point of the protest, Hirabayashi says, was to test the Constitutionality of internment. The case reached the Supreme Court in May, 1943, in record time.


""The Supreme Court decision was that, on the basis of military necessity, they would exempt certain Constitutional guarantees,"" he said. ""The state security is supreme over individual freedoms, if both are at stake.


""I don't disagree with that, but as far as I was concerned, they didn't demonstrate we were in that position . . . it was a political, racist decision.""


With the lower court decision upheld, Hirabayashi served his 90-day sentence in Tucson. After he got out, in January of 1944, he refused to answer the questionnaire given to all draft-eligible Japanese. That same questionnaire spawned the ""no-no boys"" -- Japanese who refused to join the military.


""The 'no-no boys' said no to questions 27 and 28, whether they would fight in the army,"" said Hirabayashi. ""I asked if other Americans were being given this survey and when I received no reply, I sent it back with no answers.""


For that, Hirabayashi was sent to McNeil Island Prison for a year. He didn't leave there until September, 1945, about the same time the war ended.


Hirabayashi admits that many Issei (first-generation Japanese) were probably dismayed by his defiant acts.


""My mother used tears, everything, to try to get me to go to camp,"" he remembers. ""But what really made her feel good was that strangers would come and thank her for what I was doing.


""That's about the only way I can characterize how the Isseis felt; some were for me.


Even though he received support from many Japanese, Hirabayashi was amazed no others took a stand and refused to be evacuated.


""When I refused to go, I thought that after the smoke settled, there would be maybe a hundred cases up and down the Coast like me and there would be one mass case,"" he said.


""But I was surprised. Can you imagine, 112,000 and not a single one?""


Hirabayashi believes there is a lesson to be learned from the war-time experience, especially for those who think it cannot happen again.


""Oh, it can easily happen again,"" he said. ""It's happened already, not in mass evacuation, but in different ways. The only way it could not happen is if citizens stand guard against these civil violations.""


It has taken time for Gordon Hirabayashi to talk of what he did about those civil violations, just as he says it has taken the Japanese a long time to rebound from them.


""Psychologically, we are coming out of the shock and shame,"" he said. ""We're ashamed of it because our own country did this to us. And we're fighting hard to maintain a good image of our country so that we can still hold to it.


""It's been thirty years of recovery, it takes a long time.""

As many of us have painfully discovered, Seattle is in the midst of a housing crisis. Housing prices for new and older homes have skyrocketed; the cost of maintaining and operating a home has dramatically increased; the vacancy rate for single-family and apartments is less than one percent; rental rates have sharply jumped; and displacement is widespread.


Much of this crisis is the result of the re-investment occurring in the neighborhoods. While the number of households in the City has grown, so has our economy, which as created a tremendous demand for housing.


In Seattle, like other large metropolitan areas, young professionals and others have been purchasing and fixing up houses. Meanwhile, public investments such as street, sidewalk and park improvements, and special housing programs have helped upgrade the environment in certain neighborhoods, making them more desirable to live than before. Neighborhoods such as Capitol Hill and Mt. Baker are classic examples of areas revitalized by a new population mix because of private and public reinvestment.


The housing situation in the International District is somewhat different. The ID has had a housing crisis since the mid-1960's, but not because of re-investment as much as dis-investment, particularly in the private sector. To improve the housing in the District, it would be wise to consider this and to learn from the recent experience of neighborhood re-investment, especially in view of the increasing economic pressure for development in the District.


Here are some preliminary thoughts on these issues and some very rough ideas about how to improve housing in the District. They are offered to stimulate public discussion and especially for those concerned about housing in the ID.


Developing Realistic Housing Goals


Thirty years ago, the International District had a population of slightly over 4,000. That figure has dropped to the current level of about 1,400. About one-third of the hotels in the area have been demolished and nearly all the duplexes.


According to a recent count by the City's Department of Community Development, there are 18 occupied and 17 vacant hotels in the area. Of the occupied hotels and apartments, only four comply with the City's housing and fire standards. There are only three single-family structures and a handful of duplexes in the District. Most residential structures are multi-family dwellings with single room occupancy, built before 1920 and located within the District's core.


District residents are primarily low-income elderly males. There are very few families, mostly low-income, and several dozen school-age children.


The demand for housing in the District is pretty strong: hundreds of elderly are on the waiting list to get into the low-income housing projects being built (Imperial House and International House); Asian immigrants stream into Seattle at the rate of 1,800 a year; and there is a general housing shortage in the City.


The area offers many amenities, among which are many retail stores, services, restaurants, accessible transportation, and cultural diversity. The ID is also near the Central Business District, Pioneer Square, and the Waterfront, which are, of course, centers for shopping, services, employment and entertainment.


According to Economic Research Associates, a consultant firm hired by the City to conduct an analysis of the demand for market rate housing in the District, the area could absorb over 1,000 units of such housing over the next five years. Another 1,000 units would be needed to replace existing substandard housing and the units that will be closed or demolished to meet the demand for low-income housing. These replacement units would provide for those on the waiting list to get into the new low-income housing projects, those who currently reside in substandard housing and the low-income households who want to live in the District, but cannot do so because the facilities are inadequate.


Assuming an average household size of two persons for these units, that would create a population of 4,000 (2 X 2,000). Add the 500 or so units of standard housing, mostly occupied by one-person households and that would amount to a population of 4,500 or approximately 2,500 housing units.


However, while it is reasonable to assume there is a demand for an additional 2,500 units, it does not seem likely that the District could absorb that many without demolishing most present structures and changing zoning regulations. For example, if the 35 hotels in the District, which are substandard, were rehabilitated from single room occupancies to studio or one or two-bedroom units, together they could produce around 750 to 800 units.


Without the benefit of a detailed analysis of construction or rehabilitation cost and the income limit of housing consumers, a more realistic goal, over a ten year period, would be closer to 1,900 total residential units, most of which would be one and two-bedroom units.


A breakdown would look something like this:


Existing standard housing (plus Bush Hotel)      550


Rehabilitation of existing structures            700


New construction                                 650


                                         1,900 units


As indicated above, a reasonable goal of 1,350 new or rehabilitated units could be developed over the next ten years. With completion of the two low-income elderly projects, which will produce 146 newly constructed units, and successful utilization of the Neighborhood Strategy Area allocations, which could produce 225 low income and 225 market rate housing, and with the 14 units scheduled to be rehabed at the Leyte Hotel, the District will have received half of its housing goals (660 units).


That would mean the District would have to produce another 690 housing units, beyond the number presently committed, tentatively or otherwise, to reach the goal of 1,900 units. It is highly unlikely the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will allocate to the District the relatively large number of subsidized housing it has in the past. Because of this, there is a need to bring in a middle-income population to help support the economic base of the community. Because of the high cost of construction and land acquisition, the new housing development will probably be market rate.


The overall picture would look something like this:


                                  Total     Market    Low


                                  Units     Rate     Income


Existing Standard housing         550       25        525


Rehab Housing                     700       450       250


New Housing                       650       425       225


                                  1,900     900       1000

The small cafes operated by Japanese in the International District are unique because they specialize in serving inexpensive, home-cooked American food.


Their exteriors are often deceiving. Some establishments look like run-down, hole-in-the-walls. Their interiors are very simple -- long counters with squeaky stools and maybe a few booths, high ceilings with bare walls and exposed piping, well worn floors, and compact kitchens with a minimum of working space. The average seating capacity is about 20 Most of these cafes have only three or four workers, usually family members.


Though their number is dwindling, the existing small cafes in the ID have been in business for an average of 25 years.


Before World War II, the Japanese in the ID were primarily hotel owners. With the outbreak of war, many Issei (1st generation Japanese) sold their property or transferred titles to trusted friends. The Japanese were sent to relocation camps and paid a bare minimum living wage. Many Japanese used their savings to supplement this meager income. After the War, they returned to find their property gone and little, if any, savings left.


Yet they had to find a way to rebuild their lives. So they came to the International District where property and rent were cheap. Some Japanese had taken jobs as dishwashers, kitchen aides and had picked up cooking experience. These Japanese, who saved their earnings or were fortunate enough to have pre-War savings left, bought small cafes in the ID for a nominal cost and endeavored to make a nominal living for their families.


The clientele in the ID did not consist of big spenders, and the small cafes had to take this into account by offering inexpensive meals. Sho Hiroo, a patron in the old days, explained that these cafes served an American meat casserole main dish with rice, the Oriental staple. The American meal of meat, gravy and potatoes was tailored to fit the Asian American diet of meat, gravy and rice.


Mrs. K. Nishiyama has owned Ma's Cafe since 1946. It was originally a family operation. Mrs. Nishiyama is a tiny, white-haired elderly woman. She putters around the kitchen, washes and dries the dishes, cleans and puts things in order, and shuffles outside the kitchen to chat with the customers ... all this activity takes place within ten minutes.


Ma's Cafe opens at 6 a.m. and closes at 3 p.m.


Ma's Cafe has always been family run. Now just Mrs. Nishiyama operates it. Asked about the future, she replied, ""My family don't like restaurant (business). They all go and leave everything to me ... (So) I don't know (about the cafe's future)."" The cafe has kept her life busy as well as helping her make ends meet. She said her family's younger generation tell her, ""Work, work, work ... but no money.""


The offspring of Ritoji Nishimura own the Puget Sound Hotel. At one time, the family operated the Puget Sound Cafe next door. Hiromi Nishimura, a family spokesman stated that his father bought the Puget Sound Hotel in 1935. However, the cafe has been owned by many different Japanese families before and after the Nishimura family.


Tokiya and Yoko Hamasaki, the present owners, have been running the Puget Sound for the past 26 years.


Hamasaki stated that these small cafes were usually family businesses serving office workers and businessmen in the ID. In the old days, he explained, food was cheap, so prices were low. The family worked with the simple puritan ethic of hard work, enough to eat, and spiritual happiness. His parents taught him that, ""As long as the family works, you never starve.""


Now, Hamasaki said, ""... for Nihonjins (Japanese) ... (the hard work of running the small cafe) ... is a dying thing."" He feels the younger generation is ""getting away from independent business"" and ""they don't want to work as hard.""


But, he added, ""We need American food ... (in the ID)."" He said that there are many new ethnic food restaurants being built and the few places serving American food are rapidly disappearing. For example, he said, the old Crescent Cafe will be replaced by a Chinese restaurant. The Crescent Cafe was schedule to close soon.


Hamasaki stated the need for more Sansei (third generation) and Yonsei (fourth generation) Japanese-American to take over. There is no one to take over for the elderly owners, so they are selling out their places or going to work elsewhere, Hamasaki said.


Hamasaki described the hard work involved in keeping the cafe going. He works from 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. He does food preparation at 4:30 a.m., but he said if the coffee is ready, the customers are welcome to it. He usually gets his homemade meals out in 15 minutes. Weekly and daily specials such as roast beef and meat loaf are offered. He stated that his motto is that he won't serve his customers ""What I won't eat myself."" When asked about his low prices. Hamasaki said he just wants to break even.


His customers are usually regulars and come from the ID and Immigration office across the street.


Looking out his window at a truck parking lot, he reflected on the old days when there were two hotels in front and a gas station. Hamasaki said the various hotels did not offer many paying, food-eating customers, since they housed many drunks and transients. He said he never had much trouble with these people and even had a few regular transient customers.


Hamasaki also drives a truck part-time for Western Oyster Company. It fills in the slack hours and the extra dollars help,"" he said.

Business owners and employees say they are dissatisfied with the street-scaping project currently underway in the International District. They complained about the narrowing of streets and the limited off-street parking.


Meanwhile, the City Engineering Department, in a May 22 letter to Ron Mamiya, president of the International District Economic Association (IDEA), said it will ""ask the concurrence of IDEA prior to the release of the contractor's retainage to assure that all damage (caused by the streetscaping) is repaired.""


Also, the letter said, ""the International District community may not have been adequately informed about details of the sidewalk plan and their impact on private property."" The matter is being brought to the attention of Darel Grothaus, director of the Department of Community Development, the letter stated.


Hong Louie, owner of the Atlas Restaurant, said he did not understand the reasoning behind the narrowing of Maynard Avenue. ""The streets are just too narrow,"" he said. ""It gets too crowded around here.""


There is a communication problem between the International District Review Board and business people, said Louie. ""Nobody came to me and told me that they were going to narrow the streets. They just did it.""


With the erection of lamp posts and the planting of trees yet to be completed, Louie suggested that Oriental-designed lamps with bright colors be used.


""I want to see Seattle's Chinatown look like a Chinatown,"" he said. ""It would look funny to see American-designed lamps lined along the sidewalks. Oriental designed lamps with bright lamplights and colors would help visitors remember Seattle.""


Restaurants and stores have received many negative comments from customers because of limited parking.


Greg Chew, worker at the Hong Kong Restaurant, said, ""People have a real hard time finding parking places. It has hurt business because people spend most of their lunch time looking for parking, leaving little time for their lunch.""


Byron Chinn, of the Wa Sang Grocery, said, ""Parking has to be provided. Customers must have a place to park their cars.""


Jackson Furniture Co. owner Tom Hidaka said repavement of the sidewalk in front of his store took nearly three months to be completed. Hidaka's business was not only slowed, but was inconvenienced further when parking spaces in front of his store were eliminated.


Tai Tung owner Tommy Quan said the sidewalk improvements were needed, but the sidewalk extensions and the trees that line the sidewalks are ""all a waste of money.""


""People get hurt when they trip on unfamiliar sidewalks. And the trees -- they need maintenance. That's more money.""

The attorney for the two owners of the Milwaukee Hotel says the hotel may undergo renovation, since the owners are interested in keeping the hotel open.


And Jordan Wong, one of the owners, said there are ideas for renovation into apartments, but no specific proposals are under consideration.


The King Street hotel, which houses about 35 residents, had been under threat of closure, due to numerous fire code and building code violations. All the violations were corrected by last September, except for installation of a fire alarm system, which may take place within two months.


William Wong, the owners' attorney, said ""some offers"" have been made to purchase the hotel. ""No offers have been eliminated from consideration,"" he said.


One definite offer was made by Inter*Im, which has managed the hotel since last September. Inter*Im asked the coowners for a 2 1/2-year lease, with option to purchase. The owners counter-offered by asking for $325,000 cash immediately, which Inter*Im said was unreasonable.


Wong would not reveal where the offers to purchase the hotel came from, stating that it would be ""improper"" for him to do so.


Jordan Wong, however, said he had not heard anything about offers other than the one put forward by Inter*Im.


The Seattle Housing Authority (SHA), under an informal agreement with Inter*Im, has agreed to threaten use of its power of eminent domain, to entice the owners to sell to Inter*Im.


Under eminent domain, the SHA has the power to designate private property for public use. It is unclear, however, whether SHA would go through formal eminent domain proceeding, since its board would first have to approve that step.


Al Levine, of SHA, refused to comment on the Housing Authority's discussions with Inter*Im over the Milwaukee Hotel and eminent domain. He did say, ""It would be unfortunate if the low-In-come housing resource was lost to the community.""


Elaine Ko, of Inter*Im, said her organization hopes to eventually do major renovation on the Milwaukee Hotel, but that it cannot be done without ownership.

The new Saigon Tokyo Restaurant in the International District is unique. As the name implies, the restaurant specializes in Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine. It also features several Chinese and French dishes.


Lam Nam, co-owner of the restaurant, sees this diversity as an extension of himself. Lam spent many years studying electronics in France and Japan before coming to the United States in 1975.


Lam found work as a cook at a couple of local Japanese restaurants. He developed an interest in the food business and a desire to eventually own his own place.


It was not until Lam met Do Thong, another refugee who works as a clerk at the Vietnamese Center, that the two decided to channel their abilities into opening the restaurant three months ago.


There are several other Vietnamese restaurants in Seattle: the Bamboo Tree on Aurora, the Saigon Restaurant Street Market and the Vietnam Restaurant in the Broadway area.


The owners felt a need to locate in the International District, an area where Vietnamese could easily get together and, in an atmosphere of familiarity, remember their homeland and maintain traditions. Lam's paintings, which reflect the lifestyle of his homeland, are on display in the restaurant.


Lam Nam and Do Thong also hope to acquaint the American people with the Vietnamese style of cooking. A traditional family meal consists of diced meats and vegetables served over rice, homemade soup and fresh fruit for dessert.


Cha Dzoo is the house specialty and consists of a mixture of pork, shrimp, crab and egg wrapped in onion and rice paper and served with a special fish sauce.


Although quick to admit the restaurant business is hard work, Lam smiles when he says he has a nice boss. He said he plans to stay around awhile.


The Saigon Tokyo Restaurant is open daily, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., except for Monday. It is located at 414-416 5th Ave. S. Phone: 625-9797.

Japanese film technicians recently came to Seattle to do a film on Waka Yamada, a prostitute in early Seattle who later crusaded for women's rights in Japan.


From February 10 to February 15, the crew filmed scenes for a two-hour-television special, to be shown in Japan on April 6. The film is based on the book Ameyuki-san no Uta (The Song of Ameyuki), written by Tomoko Yamazaki.


The film is titled, Ame Yuki-san (The Person Who Went to America). Semi-documentary in form, the film is a drama. The crew shot film in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. ""It's the first time the Japanese have shot 40 per cent of a film for television in the United States,"" a crew member stated. The film is being made because the novel is very famous in Japan.


""She (Waka) was especially for woman,"" said Yutaka Takamura, producer. He said she had a newspaper column similar to Ann Landers, and always advised women, ""To be strong.""


Waka adopted a son and has a grandson, said Takamura. The grandson objected to the author writing about Waka's life as a prostitute. But there are people alive who knew Waka when she was a prostitute, said Takamura.


Waka Yamada was a prostitute in Seattle in the early 1900's. When she returned to Japan, Waka became a columnist, lecturer, author of ten books, translator of two books, and a social reformer on behalf of women. She built a reform school for girls, the Hatagaya Girls' School.


The Examiner was able to piece together Waka's life story with the assistance of Julianne Kumasaka who prepared a translation from Yamazaki's book.


Waka was born Waka Asaba in Kanagawa, Japan on December 1, 1879. She was the third of eight children. At 16 she had an arranged marriage to a wealthy, miserly man called Araki. Waka left her husband and came to America, naively believing there were many opportunities for her to work.


Sold as a prostitute, Waka worked at the ""Pink Curtain,"" a brothel on 5th and King Street. The Examiner was unable to document the existence of a ""Pink Curtain."" However, the term ""pink hotel"" is often used to refer to a brothel. It could be that the ""Pink Curtain"" establishment is just a brothel, a ""pink hotel.""


Waka ran away to San Francisco with a Japanese news reporter, Nobusaburo Tachii. He wanted Waka to become a prostitute again, but she escaped the night she was to start work. She found help in a Chinatown Presbyterian Mission House for Chinese girls, the ""Cameron House."" She worked there, interpreting for other unfortunate girls from Japan.


In 1905, Waka married Kasuke Yamada, a sociologist. He had a private school, and educated her in English, history, economics and other subjects. The earthquake in 1906 destroyed his school, so they returned to Japan.


In the late 1930's, Waka lectured on a good-will tour in the United States. She met Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House. Waka spoke in Seattle's Nippon Kan (Japanese Hall) before a skeptical crowd. Her calm dignity quieted those in the audience who wanted to remind her of her former occupation. Kazuo Ito, in Issei, recalls her opening statement: ""I dare to say these things because I myself have had a hard experience!""


Circumstances of the time caused Japanese women like Waka to become prostitutes. Next month The Examiner will tell the story of Japanese prostitutes in Early Seattle.

The Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) early this month offered to purchase the Milwaukee Hotel for renovation. At press time, there was no word whether the owners, Don Louie and Jordan Wong, would negotiate terms with the PDA.


The International District Housing Alliance and Inter*Im have managed the King Street hotel since September, 1977. Inter*Im has unsuccessfully sought to purchase the hotel, saddled over the past several years with numerous fire code violations.


On June 13, the PDA Council authorized Mcdonald Sullivan, executive director of the PDA, to make an offer to purchase the Milwaukee Hotel.


It is hoped that because of the tax advantages the PDA could offer, the owners might be willing to negotiate sale of the hotel.


William Wong, attorney for the Milwaukee Hotel owners, said, ""The owners have been advised of the offer. But I can't give out any information about it. I am just a conduit in this matter.""


The Examiner has learned that at least two other tentative offers have been made to purchase the hotel -- one coming from a Hong Kong-based group interested in constructing a restaurant on the site and one from a local party. The Hong Kong group, however, has apparently backed out of its offer.


Wong refused to discuss any of the offers. ""I told them (the owners) a couple of other offers have been made, but nothing has materialized,"" said Wong. He also noted, ""We can't have this thing prolonged. It doesn't do anyone any good.""

The need for more housing and concern about government response to this need dominated the discussion of the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (Public Authority) second annual conference at the Battelle Center August 25.


A sample survey given to conference attendees also showed housing as a major concern.


The conference was held to ""review and examine the Public Authority's role to promote, assist, and encourage the renewal, rehabilitation, preservation and development of the District."" About 40 people attended. Panel discussions elicited views from community and governmental representatives. Key community and government leaders were notably absent, however.


The Public Authority is chartered by the City of Seattle and organized to administer federal funds and programs in the International District. The agency is presently working to renovate the Bush Hotel into a community center complex.


According to the survey, low-income and market-rate housing needs remain major problems facing the District.


Michael Hildt, chairperson of the Seattle City Council Urban Development and Housing Committee, said he hopes to see the city getting into more direct housing aid to communities such as the ID. ""The district is vitally important,"" he continued. ""It's very definitely on the rise,"" and ""deserves careful consideration"" from the City. Hildt suggested a stronger working relationship between the ID and the City, which, he said, does not presently exist on an ongoing basis.


Carol Lewis, representing the Mayor's office, said there are opportunities in the ID to ""create a downtown neighborhood the likes of which nobody has ever seen"" and sees the Public Authority as having the power to cause development and effective change. Lewis said there is a commitment on the ""12th floor"" (Mayor's Office) to the ID.


Tom Downey, representing the City's Department of Community Development Housing Division, said the City is working with the Public Authority to develop housing. ""The ID is a priority area for rehabilitation funds,"" he said. Downey's office deals with HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) and other federal programs and coordinates these programs with the local community.


When asked, however, if there was a commitment on paper from the Federal Government, Downey's reply was ""no.""


Community representatives at the conference responded favorably to the Public Authority's current efforts and activities in the ID. ""It seems that the PDA's progress has been 'right on' in regards to housing and economic development,"" Dan Rounds of Inter*Im said. ""There is a good mix of activities.""


Most people at the conference were anxious to see the Bush Hotel Community Center develop. ""We've been waiting and waiting for the Bush to develop,"" Cherry Kinoshita, International Realty, said: ""Once it gets going other development will begin to happen.""


Arlene Oki, special assistant to Mayor Charles Royer, agrees. Oki said City government is taking a wait-and-see attitude about the ID. The ID has encountered resistance from some people in City departments because ""they feel that nothing is happening,"" she said. It's important, Oki continued, that the Community Center and the Theater Annex (also a Public Authority project) move ahead as quickly as possible. These projects are being watched as a basis for future government monies being put into the ID, she said.

The big problem facing the newly-appointed director of the Denise Louie Child Care Center is money. Shiz Iida, appointed to replace former director Connie Chin in April, said, ""Once we can get stabilized funding, we can talk about expanding and having field trips for the kids.""


The Child Care Center CETA positions end in September. As a result, Iida will have to seek alternative funding sources to cover the positions. The Center is seeking United Way funding. ""Hopefully if we get that, then that will take care of the CETA program,"" she said. ""If not, that leaves me with a lot of work.""


The Center, located near the old Chinese Baptist Church on King Street, is made of two portables hooked together. The Center is licensed to handle 20 children; at present it has 18. The Child Care Center concentrates its efforts on serving children of low-income immigrant families. ""They are the people we are here to serve,"" said Iida.


A normal day starts out with breakfast for the kids that come in early, then free time, music, snacks, stories and playing outside. What's unique about the Denise Louie Child Care Center is that the staff members are bilingual and there is a good racial mix among the children. The children are encouraged to express themselves in the language to which they're most accustomed.


The Center has 10 regular staff members, including three to four junior high school students and a former school teacher, who work part-time.


""This gives the kids a wide variety of the real world -- a good mix of teachers,"" said Iida. ""Each staff member makes a contribution to each child's life. This good racial mix of staff covers all the languages spoken by the kids.""


Shiz Iida, originally from Seattle, began her background working with children in Chicago, Illinois, where she was a social worker at the Travelers Aid Society. She worked with children, teachers, principals, and parents, listening to problems and sorting them out.


She then joined the Head Start Program as a social worker. Since the program was in its first year, she was involved in everything, including organizing meetings, watching out for the children, and supervising bus riders.


From there, she moved back to Seattle and became involved in community schools, She became an active member of the Seattle Council of Parents Teachers Student Association. During this time, Iida received a certificate in Early Childhood from Seattle Central Community College and worked at the student day care center. Now she's at the Denise Louie Child Care Center.


Iida said the funding problem will affect the Day Care Center program. Without funding, many qualified persons may lose their jobs. ""It's a shame to lose their people because of lack of money,"" she said. ""That's really sad. We have a good staff -- dedicated people who work hard. They're bilingual and have good skills working with kids.""


At present, a head teacher position remains unfilled. There is a qualified person to fill the job, but she can't be hired because she doesn't meet the CETA standards. Since there isn't a head teacher, Shiz Iida is covering some of those duties of organizing the staff curriculum as well as her administrative duties. She gives up part of her job to keep the program going.


""Sometimes I feel torn between the administrative job and the teaching job,"" she said. ""There is no head teacher and we're short of staff. I quickly have to learn how to prioritize, but the kids have a high priority for me.""


Moving the Child Care Center to another location has been discussed, but the other sites were too expensive.


""The kids need more room and there would be less confrontations between kids,"" she said. ""It's also hard to concentrate because we're located right by the freeway -- that's bad for people's hearing. I don't think we can expand until we get more funds.""


Besides getting individual attention, the children at the Denise Louie Child Care Center have a chance to learn the arts, music and dance through cultural activities. Children from different ethnic backgrounds are able to pick up the songs and ways of different countries, and Shiz Iida thinks, ""That's fantastic!""

The Kawabe Memorial House is celebrating its 7th anniversary. The retirement home was originally founded by Harry Sotatsu Kawabe, an industrialist and merchant familiar to many in Seattle.


""Kawabe had always dreamed of providing a retirement home for elderly Japanese in the community,"" recalls Tak Kubota, administrator for Kawabe House. At that time, Kubota said, ""Japanese in particular had a stigma about their elderly moving out of their families. But that began to change."" As the need for housing grew, a site at Washington and S. Main St. was chosen for the future retirement home.


At 16, Harry Kawabe came to the United States from Japan. Although never formally educated, he later became a successful industrialist in Alaska. In Seattle, he became the proprietor of Kawabe Art and Gift Shop.


Kawabe sought to establish what was to be known as Central Senior House. He did this with the help of other leaders in the community. In addition to this time and effort, Kawabe also granted $100,000 to the project.


Two years before Central Senior House was finished, Kawabe passed away. Upon his death, the retirement home was renamed the Kawabe Memorial House.


Today, approximately 190 elderly live at the home. The building has a 162-unit capacity, 20 designed for the disabled. The facilities at Kawabe include a library, living room, game room, and a large dining hall. The residents who live there are mainly low income elderly. Kubota emphasized that, although Kawabe House was once intended for the Japanese community, other ethnic groups make up one half the residents.


Since Kawabe House is a federally subsidized housing project, tenants pay approximately 25 per cent of their income for rent. The rest is subsidized by the government. In addition, residents are provided with three square meals a day for $30 a month.


""We've been used as a model for other facilities of this kind in other cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago,"" said Kubota. The reason, he pointed out, is that Kawabe House provides a unique community atmosphere where the residents enjoy taking part in educational and social programs.


Activities include: singing, drama, religion classes, hana (Japanese cards), movies, and parties. In addition, community organizations often come to entertain the residents.


""I have met a lot of friends here,"" commented one resident. She added that because of the strict security system that Kawabe employs, she also believes it is a safe place to live.

Who can remember wearing baggy ski pants, laced, leather ski boots; maneuvering long, wooden skis, and poles with large bamboo baskets on the ends? A number of local Asians can.


Nobi Kano, who now runs several camera shops, recalls that in the 1930s, a hardcore group of Asians -- ski aficionados -- hit the slopes every weekend. They recognized that it was almost unthinkable for whites to allow Asians to associate with them in recreational activities. So rather than try to join their ski clubs, they kept to themselves.


Saturday afternoons, Nobi remembered, the phone rang constantly at work. Who was going skiing this Sunday? Who was driving? Where would they meet? It was a weekly ritual.


In 1938, the ski club -- the Asian ski club -- was organized, claiming between 35 and 40 members. They were unique. What should they call themselves? The president of the club, Ted Nakashima, suggested ""Rokka."" Kano remembers Nakashima explaining that the name came from ""one of the oldest, most exclusive ski clubs in Japan."" It translates directly as ""six-pointed flower,"" and is interpreted as snow flake.


Once formed, the club had to be recognized by other clubs registered with the Pacific Northwest Ski Association (PNSA). Again, acceptance by a non-white club seemed unthinkable. Kano gives credit to Nakashima, who was very resourceful and assertive. He ""knew a lot of people because of his business as a car salesman.... he pulled some strings, (and Rokka) got accepted by PNSA,"" said Kano.


A victory for the club! Most of the members were interested in racing, and PNSA sponsored national races annually. In 1939, Kano and a few others entered the races at Hyak. ""(We) all set the record as the bottom ten,"" he said.


In subsequent years, Rokka challenged the Fujii Ski Club of Vancouver, B.C. A fine silver cup was donated by Mr. Toda of Vancouver to honor the winner of the race each year. ""They [the Fujii Club] kept it mostly,"" Kano said, laughing. According to Kano, skiing increased Asian contact with whites, and helped downplay discrimination. The club eventually got better racing coaches and some became successful racers.


Rokka was more than a racing club. It was also a social club, said Nobi. Every New Year's Eve, Rokka sponsored a formal party -- ""a big, big event."" Paul Suzuki, the present area director at Snoqualmie for Rokka, who joined the club after the war, recalls 300 to 400 people at the parties.


World War II broke up the club, broke off the annual new year's dance, broke off the Rokka challenge to the Fujii Club. The coveted silver cup was ""confiscated"" during the war and never found again, although Kano tried to locate it when he returned after the war. Interest in skiing did not dissipate; it only lay fallow during the war. By the late 40s, Japanese Americans were trickling back to the snowy slopes. Around 1952, Rokka was reorganized. The leadership changed hands, and a large group of younger people joined.


Suzuki recalls monthly meetings during the winter in the Collins Fieldhouse on 16th between Main and Washington Streets. There, Nobi gave pointers to improve club members' skiing; he talked about ski care and new equipment.


Rokka became a ski school in the late 50s. Nobi was the first in the club to pass the PNSA exam, becoming a certified instructor. He taught other club members who later passed the exam and also became instructors. Nobi became ski school director since ""there was no one else."" He had seen the club grow from a mere 40 to twice that size. Membership peaked at 440 in 1975.


The club has maintained an average membership of 300 to present. And to some, it still serves as something more substantial than a conglomeration of ski enthusiasts. Why has it survived, and why is it still primarily an Asian ski club? For Suzuki, Rokka ""provides a unique tie-in for the Asian community."" Suzuki said that as more Asians move out to the suburbs, it becomes ever more important to maintain informal contact with other Asians, especially when there are few fellow Asians to socialize with in the neighborhood and at work. Rokka gives isolated Asians a chance to get to know other Asians where they normally wouldn't, said Suzuki.


Rokka ski school has changed because ski instruction techniques have taken a different direction in recent years, and because equipment has changed so drastically. But, there is some concern that the club is not adapting quickly enough. Suzuki said that there are not enough new Asian youths willing to put time into the club and take responsibility for making it work. If new ideas are lacking, said Suzuki, the club will stagnate. ""The enthusiasm of the club still depends on its leadership,"" he said.


""Bringing in new blood to take over the old post"" is not enough, according to Gerry Miyazaki, Rokka ski instructor. The club officers need to instigate changes where they are needed.


""Meetings should have a purpose ... plus draw people there,"" said Miyazaki. Why not hold dry-land ski demonstrations, or have an outside speaker come in and talk to members, Miyazaki asked. Naturally, all this takes some coordinating and involvement on the part of either the officers or interested members.


""I have this good feeling that the club has so much potential, but we're not using it,"" said Miyazaki. He noted that there are few Asian social clubs. Rokka has the membership and inner structure already there, but rarely are there functions that extend beyond skiing interests.


It seems that, to be successful, Rokka will have to go beyond satisfying the singular interests of the 30s: ""Hey, you goin' skiing this weekend? Who's gonna drive?"" Rokka is, after all, more than just a ski club.

Members of the United Garment Workers (UGW) Local 17 recently ratified a new three-year union contract, which provides a 26 percent total wage increase. Nine companies -- including Farwest, Sportscaster, and Roffe -- are represented by the UGW.


However, Chinese workers comprise about 60 percent of the workforce there; and a sizeable number do not understand English. Because of this, Chinese workers say they are excluded from contract decision making.


The Chinese Media Committee (CMC) interviewed several Chinese garment workers on the contract voting procedures.


""Americans ask questions and discuss terms"" of the contract, stated one worker. ""They understand what is going on because they understand the language. Consequently, Chinese workers vote on what the English speaking workers believe to be a fair contract.""


Three years ago, the CMC filed a grievance with the National Labor Relations Board charging a lack of Chinese translators. The CMC offered to translate at meetings, but was denied the opportunity to do so. Instead, union officials found other translators. The union agreed to translate the contract, and the complaint was later dropped.


This year, many Chinese workers were dissatisfied with the translator who interpreted at the contract meeting.


""The translator only translated the basic content of the contract -- and not what the union officials say at the meetings,"" stated one source.


As a result, many did not know what they were voting for. Workers frequently passed their ballots to the person next to them. ""I just know what my neighbor does,"" commented one woman.


Marianne Alexander, business agent and secretary of Local 17, confirmed that the union does not employ a regular interpreter. ""I get one when I need one,"" she said.


Alexander would not disclose who translated at meetings, or if they were paid for their services. Alexander commented, ""She (the interpreter) did us a favor.""


Before elections, Alexander said, she tried to explain, in English, contract terms to Chinese workers. When asked if this seemed unrealistic given the language barrier, Alexander replied, ""Why don't they learn English? I've got 500 Chinese people. Why don't they translate for each other?""


So far, very few if any workers have voiced their thoughts because they feel there is no job security. Workers say their friends were laid off and never called back.


Complaints do not end with the voting process and insufficient translation.


At Farwest, Asians comprise 85 percent of the Seattle plant in comparison to a 95 percent white workforce at the Renton plant.


Seattle employees reported discrimination in unfair working and wage practices. Since workers are paid by the piece, the more familiar one is to the pattern, the faster a piece can be finished. Some Seattle pieceworkers say they typically made less per hour than Renton workers because patterns were frequently difficult or changed from day to day.


Verl Morton, Farwest floor supervisor said she wasn't aware of any complaints, but admitted there were some discrepancies in work distribution.


""Seattle did the hard garments, while Renton did the easy"" ones, she pointed out. However, with the recent closure of the Seattle plant and transfer of those workers to Renton, everyone is gradually learning to do the difficult ones.


A large percentage of Chinese workers do not know where to file grievances outside of talking to supervisors or the union.


Hannah Wu, of the CMC urges any garment workers with complaints to call the Chinese Radio Program at KRAB, or go to the Chinese Information Center, where they can find assistance.

The International District-Chinatown Public Development Authority (PDA) plans to begin rehabilitation of the New Central Hotel by year's end. The vacant, three-story, brick building is located at the southeast corner of Maynard Ave. S. and S. Lane.


The PDA plans to renovate the building to provide approximately 40 apartments and 12,000 square feet of commercial space at street level. According to Al Kurimura, ID Manager, rehabilitation of the New Central Hotel will be another step toward reestablishing a residential and business core at the southern end of the ID.


On April 25, the PDA Board gave the go ahead for formal negotiations for purchase of the building from the Nishimura family.


The New Central Hotel is one of several properties developed by Ritoji Nishimura. Nishimura came to Seattle in 1903 and purchased his first hotel, the Star Hotel, in 1908 from savings earned as a farm worker and dishwasher. At one time Ritoji Nishimura and his children operated more than 10 hotels and apartments including the New Central Hotel.


Like many other older hotel buildings in the International District, the New Central was closed because of code violations in the early 1970's. Several groups have dreamed of re-opening the building. However, none progressed as far as the PDA.


""The City is excited about the rehabilitation of the New Central Hotel,"" Kurimura said. ""It is an opportunity to demonstrate that the PDA can work with a long-time ID property owner in renovating a vacant building to provide much needed housing and retail space. This renovation coupled with completion of the 96-unit International House and the continued operation of the Ohio Hotel will make the intersection of Maynard and Weller a focal point for resident and small business activities.""

A lot of ""soles"" need saving in the International District. The new shoe repair shop on Fifth and Jackson, the only such business in the District, should attract many customers ranging from elderly residents to businesspeople. The small, unheated shop, sandwiched between Bishop's Drug and Franglor's Creole Cafe is owned and operated by Mr. and Mrs. Insup Yu, a Korean couple who have been in Seattle since April.


""We need a shoe repair shop down here"" for the many elderly who cannot afford to buy new shoes, Bob Santos, director of Inter*Im, said. Santos ""helped us to find this place,"" Yu said. ""He introduced us to Mr. Roblee (owner of the building).""


The Yu's are from Seoul, Korea. Mrs. Yu came to the U.S. in 1975, joining her family in New York. Mr. Yu joined his wife three years later. The couple lived in Los Angeles before moving to Seattle. Before opening the shop in the District, the Yu's had a shoe repair shop on Olive Way.


Although the Yu's said ""business in New York and Los Angeles are better,"" they prefer the Seattle weather and the access to (bodies of) water. ""My wife disliked Los Angeles weather,"" Yu said. ""The water and weather here like Korea.""


According to Yu, he was a shoemaker and owned his own small shoe making business in Korea. He has been in the business five years. The Yu's, however, have no desire to go back to Korea. ""There are many chances, opportunities to do something in the U.S.A.,"" he said. ""There are not so many chances in Korea,"" where large enterprises limit the opportunities of smaller businesses. ""We are getting too old,"" Mrs. Yu added.


Yu's shoe repair apparatus take up almost three quarters of the shop. Large, durable machinery for stitching, cutting, grinding and polishing shoes are lined up against one entire wall of the shop.


Mrs. Yu also operates a business in the same shop on Jackson Street. While Mr. Yu mends soles, Mrs. Yu sells jewelry and other decorative items in one corner of the shop. Mrs. Yu had owned a wholesale custom jewelry business in New York. Presently she sells jewelry imported from Korea, Hong Kong India, and Brazil. She also sells wall hangings and paper mache and fabric flowers.


The shop is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 am to 6 pm. The address is 509 S. Jackson Street, 623-7611.

""It's a true story. It happened in a phone conversation I had with my mother,"" Kathy Wong said about her recently published children's story, Don't Put the Vinegar in the Copper. Jenny, the main character, and her mother prepare to make suon gee geeh (sour pigs' feet). Mama warns Jenny not to put the vinegar in a copper pot, or it would turn into green poison. Jenny's mother does not speak English well, so Jenny thinks she hears that if the vinegar is put into the cupboard, it will turn into a green person. Jenny dreams about the wild, green person who will form from the vinegar, but she soon discovers her fantasy was created from a misunderstanding. Jenny learns that vinegar turns copper green. More importantly, she learns that she should listen carefully to her mother, who sometimes has trouble pronouncing her words.


Wong is particularly sensitive to the latter point. She says her Chinese-speaking parents felt ""handicapped"" when speaking English. Looking back now, Wong ""can feel the exasperation and frustration"" her mother felt when trying to communicate with her daughter.


This frustration is in the story, when Mama tires of repeating herself and becomes impatient with Jenny's persistent questions about the cupboard and the green person. The story is about communication, says Wong. She tries to eliminate ate barriers to communication in the layout of the book. It is bilingual, to be shared by parent and child, foreign-born and American-born.


Wong stresses the importance of communication between first-generation parents and second-generation children who have more familiarity with the American language and culture. ""If we don't try to listen and be patient, we alienate each other, and from that alienation comes hostility,"" she said. Communication, according to Wong, is something that everyone has to work at.


How is this point made to children? Wong read her story aloud to a group of Kimball Elementary students. Afterwards, they played a word game. Wong said a word and the students had to respond with one that rhymed. Soon the children began arguing over the word Wong gave. Was it type or kite? They immediately realized how easy it is to misunderstand someone.


Writing, for Wong, has been an expression of her hope that ""we [Chinese Americans] don't forget our backgrounds, or how we've been molded through our history."" Wong felt her writing was suppressed by teachers who did not encourage her to write from an Asian American perspective. Writing was also discouraged within the Asian community because of the work ethic. Writing was not considered a stable profession. Wong believed in herself, her ability, and feels that writing is like ""unearthing energy [that has] always been there.""


Wong enjoys working with, and writing for children. ""You can pour anything into them,"" she said. She is delighted that they are so ""free thinking,"" and open to suggestions. She uses them as a sounding board for ideas that might be molded into a story. They squealed over the green person who danced among the bowls and chopsticks. ""Kids love monsters,"" Wong said. Yet, to readers of all ages, the green person becomes more than a monster, it is an embodiment of our confused communication. And when we can make the green person vanish, we recognize the value of really listening.


Don't Put the Vinegar in the Copper is available at Uwajimaya, David Ishii Bookstore, and Glover-Hayes.

The beauty of Japanese calligraphy (shodo), portrayed with the utmost concentration of feeling and sensitivity, is expressed in the works of Seikai Kunii. One of the leading modern abstract, calligraphic masters of Japan, Kunii has been practicing calligraphy for 47 years.


He has also studied the Buddhist doctrine of Zen which, he says, is ""a supremely harmonious system which puts not only our life and body in order but our spirit and self as well."" This order, he says, describes the state most desirous to himself. Calligraphy enables the calligrapher to speak from his heart and his mind through his brush.


Calligraphy, one of the oldest and most revered art forms in Asia, is composed of characters known as kanji. Kanji, meaning ""the words"" in Japanese, was invented by the Chinese over 3000 years ago and used by the Japanese for over 1400 years. The very first kanji were probably pictographs or shapes closely representing physical forms.


The intrinsic meanings of the words he writes are all important to the calligrapher. By reflecting one's experiences through the meaning of the word or words, written calligraphy becomes a mirror of those things one normally cannot express.


Kunii uses brushes made from the hair of sheep, goats, deer and fox. The ink he uses is ground from an ink stone. He uses only black ink and works to vary the intensity of ink. He selects his papers carefully.


Kunii emphasizes that his works are contemporary rather than traditional. One of his graphic expressions is titled, ""My Words."" In it, he conveys, ""With my words here I desired to emphasize the necessity for taking good care of things with which Nature has endowed us.""


A large, soft-grey scroll is called ""Tobu-to fly,"" and in it Kunii expresses, ""that a strong and healthy mind will motivate us with great energy.""


Kunii has collections of his work on exhibit at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Gallery Loo, Paris, Japan House Gallery, New York and many others. He has had 21 one-man shows similar to the one in Seattle, and has been commended by the California legislature for his contribution to mutual understanding between the United States and Japan through calligraphy.


Perhaps one of the pieces in this collection that best describes what Kunii is attempting to convey through his work is titled, ""Carve Out."" In it, he says, ""Through writing of the word I sought to find out the way of life in which we strictly inquire the profundity of human mind.""


The calligraphy of Seikai Kunii was exhibited earlier this month at the Wing Luke Memorial Museum.

A Contemporary Theatre (ACT) opened its second show of the season, David Hare's Fanshen, on June 7.


Hare's play is based upon William Hinton's book, Fanshen: A Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village, first published in 1966. Hinton -- now a Pennsylvania farmer -- was in China for several periods between 1937 and 1953; the materials for Fanshen were gathered during his six-month stay in the tiny Chinese village of Long Bow, where the land reform program was being guided by a work team dispatched by the People's Government and the Communist Party Committee of Lucheng County.


The play Fanshen (which means ""to turn over"") is an account of how the people of Long Bow village came to terms with the communist revolution and created a new life for themselves.


The cast includes Henry Bal, last seen at ACT as ""Bromden"" in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1973; Edward Baran, who played the ""Corporal"" in Bally-Murphy and ""Douglas"" in Henry IV, Part I, at ACT and ""Carroll"" in Heat at the Empty Space Association; Clayton Corzatte, who recently appeared as ""Moricet"" in 13 Rue de l'amour at the Seattle Repertory Theatre; Richard Eng, who is making his ACT debut, but has appeared elsewhere in Seattle in Year of the Dragon, Nisei Bar and Grill and Jack Rabbit, and now studies at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York; R.A. Farrell, who has been a member of the Young ACT Company and was a featured actor at the Oregon Shakespearean Festival for two years; John Kauffman, who played ""Abidin"" in Makassar Reef last year at ACT, and recently returned from The Citadel Theatre in Edmonton, Alberta, where he played ""David Joe"" in The Ecstasy of Rita Joe; Haunani Minn, who appeared in ACT's Marat/Sade in 1969; Isai Sato, a native of Japan, who came to the United States to perform in the Broadway production of Pacific Overtures, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award; and Allyn Sitjar, a native of Hollywood, California, who recently was seen in New York at La Mama E.T.C. as ""Dai Sun"" in The Legend of Wu Chang.


Fanshen runs June 7-30, with a preview performance June 6, at ACT Theatre, 709 First Avenue West, Seattle, Curtain time is 8 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday; 7:30 p.m. on Sundays.


For single tickets, call the ACT Box Office, 285-5110, noon to curtain time each day except Monday, when the Box Office is closed.

The ""key to new development"" in the International District, Ed Burke believes, is the ""motivation of the people who own the land."" Burke is owner of the Astor Hotel building on 6th and Washington. He hopes to renovate the building for office use and restore the Nippon Kan, an old theater hall, into a concert theater.


Burke is one of several property owners planning or interested in developing his properties. Recent development includes: the Rainier National Bank building, two low-income housing projects, and the Bush Hotel Community Center project. Nevertheless, the district remains substantially deteriorated. Many hotel buildings remain closed. Small businesses continue to fail; and the declining residential population remains elderly and poor.


Several external and internal forces contribute to the continuing deterioration of the district. Not the least of the internal factors is the conservative, cautious attitude of property owners.


The district's future, according to I.D. Project Manager Al Kurimura, will be affected by owners ""who do things"" and owners ""who do nothing"" to their properties. Kurimura said some major property owners, including Tomio Moriguchi and Terry Toda, do things and benefit the district. Another major property owner, Rainier Heat and Power, Kurimura continues, will be important to watch. ""How they divest their properties will be important,"" he said.


This could mean the next owner will be the person or persons who can put out the most cash. The William Chappell Estate Trust, according to Rainier Heat & Power property manager Shigeko Uno, states that the properties be sold to the highest bidders. ""We are obligated by law to do that,"" she said. At his height, Chappell owned three full blocks of property. Five buildings along Jackson and lower King Streets are still waiting for buyers.


Owners who do nothing, it is generally conceded by those interviewed, probably will not play an active role in I.D. development in the next 10 years. Owners in the King Street core particularly, Burke said, ""are not development-oriented, but holding-oriented."" By doing nothing, these owners will also affect the district's growth. ""There are only a certain number of things that can happen because of ownership,"" Burke said. ""The ownership controls what happens.""


One difficulty with property ownership on King Street, according to Kurimura, is that many of the buildings are owned by tongs, family associations or investment groups.


""I think it's a big problem because you've got unclear ownership,"" Kurimura said. ""Nobody has direct control to make decisions. Also, I think the general feeling is that there is much financial security in having a piece of property and building.""


Barry Mar is property manager of the Atlas building on the northeast corner of Maynard and King Streets. The Atlas is a partnership. Mar is dealing with the multiple ownership problem. The City's Department of Community Development and the Atlas ownership are negotiating for possible renovation of the Atlas using Department of Housing and Urban Development funding. ""At this point in time we are very interested in the project,"" Mar said, ""and it's a matter of pulling the California (part of the) partnership on board."" Mar does not foresee a major revitalization of King Street in the next 10 years ""because of the nature of property owners down here. Even if the Atlas partnership is successful, I think other owners will wait and see if it's successful, to see whether or not we can make the payments.""


Mar estimates between ""three to five years before we see any movement anywhere else. The Chinese ownership is basically fiscally conservative and the other side of it is that ownership is all and there's no need to risk capital.""


McDonald Sullivan, Public Authority director, acknowledges the King Street core is static, but says it ""is good in that it's not being sold off to major developers who want to change the neighborhood.""


Danny Woo, president of the board of Kong Yick Investment Co., is optimistic about development of King Street. The Kong Yick Investment Co. owns two buildings on the south side of King Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Woo refutes claims that he is a property owner who does nothing for development. ""In the past it's been holding, but I intend to make them grow (the two buildings),"" he said. ""I'm exploring avenues, possibly rehabilitating for moderate income housing and try to bring young families back to the area.


""I think the board (of Kong Yick) would be receptive to the idea. I have talked to Al (Kurimura) and McDonald. (Sullivan) and also we can get enough private loans to do it. The two buildings are worth three-quarter million dollars."" Woo thinks many property owners don't rehabilitate their buildings because ""they don't think they can get enough rent to offset the cost of rehabilitation or construction. In the past rents have been kept low to accommodate the Chinese community."" Now, he said, it would be difficult to raise rents on small shop owners.


King Street property owners, of course, are not the only ones unwilling to take risks. The Nishimura family, which owns the Puget Sound Hotel and the New Central Hotel, has not, at this writing, taken any step to develop its properties. Hiromi Nishimura would not make any statements, but acknowledged the family has plans for their properties.


Essentially property owners are not willing to take risks and invest when the gains are minimal and the obligations may be substantial. This is particularly true with low-income housing, where there is not a big profit to be made when the rents are kept arbitrarily low, according to Department of Community Development housing section staff member Debora Roseboom.


Banks contribute to the lack of development by not investing in the district. Kurimura's main task is ""to make private money available,"" to let banks know the I.D. is a safe area to invest in,"" Kurimura said.


Kurimura sees the Public Authority as potentially ""controlling a lot in the area. They may be the only one who can provide cheap enough financing, or who has access to cheap enough funding for development.""


Sullivan agrees. ""The Public Authority can, in working with business people in the I.D., make projects that would otherwise be impossible financially."" The Public Authority can provide tax-free money to property owners. ""If we bought property from an I.D. owner,"" Sullivan explains, ""and we pay the interest to him as part of the mortgage, that portion would be tax-free income to the individual."" It would provide an incentive for development, he said.


The Public Authority is developing the Bush Hotel Community Project and negotiating for theater space in Terry Toda's T & C Building. And ""We're looking for a third project,"" Sullivan said.


""I think we are the major developer in the I.D. in my estimation,"" he said. ""We like to do more Section 8 and, at a later date, market-rate housing."" Sullivan acknowledges the Public Authority has $70,000 in block grant funds. This will be used, he said, to lay the groundwork to qualify a building for renovation into low-income housing. ""We are trying to put together a deal at the present time,"" Sullivan said. He would not comment further about possible contenders for the $70,000.


On the northern fringe, the Imperial House (99 units of low-income housing) is under construction. Ed Burke is planning to renovate the Astor Hotel, and negotiations are underway between CHG, International and a private developer for rights to the Terrace View on Sixth Avenue and Yesler. The private developer proposes moderate-income housing on the hill. Tomio Moriguchi has plans for his Fifth and Main property. ""We've been approached by developers to build housing on that lot,"" he said. However, much of that is just talk at present, Moriguchi said.


Development may not be happening in the district's core, but the district's fringes are experiencing activity. The southern fringe, considered the light manufacturing and service delivery area, ""will affect King Street positively in terms of more business,"" Sullivan says.


Current construction activity in the southern fringe includes: the Rainier National Bank Building at Seventh and Lane and the 99-unit Security Pacific Section 8 low-income housing.


Jim Sheeley, I.D. Branch Manager for Rainier, said, ""We have made a sizeable commitment to the area in the size of building being constructed."" The bank will take up most of the building.


Sheeley said the bank expanded its facilities because of business growth in the area and the overall economic growth in the Northwest. This growth will probably affect the district, Sheeley said. Rising property values and growing economic pressures, he suggested, will affect businesses' growth in the I.D.


The newly-formed Inter*Im Community Development Association recently submitted a proposal for comprehensive economic planning and development in the I.D. to the Community Service Association of the Office of Economic Development. The $150,000-$200,000 planning grant elaborates on how regional growth will affect the district:


""The International District is sitting squarely in the path of progress. The regional economic boom, the housing crisis, and downtown office, hotel and commercial expansion are having continually increasing effects on the district.


The northern and western edges of the I.D. are prime areas for office construction. Already, land values in this area are escalating at an alarming rate. Service industries for downtown business are being forced out of the central business district because of spiraling rents. Because these industries must be accessible to their downtown clients, the International District is an ideal locale.... This trend also will cause higher rents and property values, as well as reducing existing housing units, to the detriment of small business and residents in the area. The development of the downtown area also creates pressure for increased private and public traffic flow across the district.


To be competitive with suburban shopping centers, downtown retailers must improve their access from outlying areas. Many of the transit options now being considered utilize the Union Station site in the International District as a focal point for incoming traffic. Commercial and housing development in the District itself is literally dependent upon a traffic pattern which does not hopelessly clog the area's streets.""


Although there are many aspects to the CDC proposal, the incentive is the forces for development pushing against the area. The hope is, eventually, to have the ""community control the development of its valuable resources.""

Diane Sugimura's ""common sense approach and good judgment"" will be greatly missed by the International Special Review District Board when she steps down as Board chairperson sometime later this month, one Board member said.


Sugimura has served as chairperson for the past two-and-a-half years, during which the Board has undergone heated controversy and challenges to its authority. Sugimura's decision not to run for re-election, according to observers, leaves the Board without any individuals who possess a strong urban planning background and the ability to effectively lead the Special Review Board.


The Board oversees development in the International District and makes recommendations to the City Department of Community Development.


Sugimura, who will leave her position after the recently invalidated Review Board election is reheld August 16, spoke to The Examiner about problems the Board will have to tackle in the future as well as Board accomplishments during her time of service on the Board.


She said the Board must rewrite its development regulations without getting tied up in technical language, which is what happened the first time revisions were attempted. She said there is a need to have ""an overall picture"" and to start with general community meetings to solicit input.


""For example,"" she said, ""some of the problems anticipated from the Domed Stadium -- traffic things -- have not turned out to be so bad, and there are other pressures on the District -- Union Station and I-90. And yet we still have to watch out that the District doesn't become a parking lot.""


She said the Review Board ""started out on the wrong foot."" The Board never launched a public relations effort ""to sell the regulations to the community,"" she said, even though the Board was advised to do so.


One continuing problem has been poor relations between the Board and Chinese property owners on King Street, in the core of the International District. They have charged the Board with impeding development and threatening the identity of the Chinese community.


Last year, Review Board members met with the newly-elected board of the Chong Wah Benevolent Association to talk about translating into Chinese a simplified version of the revised development regulations.


But, Sugimura said, because of changes in the City staffperson for the Board, there was no follow-up. The Board has only been able to keep up with the more mundane task of approving signing changes, she added.


At a recent meeting of the Review Board, City staffperson Greg Ptucha announced that an effort would be made to bring, before the Board, persons who have put up signs without prior Board approval.


Sugimura said going after violators of the Special Review District ordinance presents a problem. ""On the one hand,"" she said, ""if you don't do it, you penalize people who come before the Board to get approval and it pays to ignore the Board. The other frustration is that, generally, it's the smaller businesses -- which we should be trying to encourage -- the people who put up small hand-painted signs, those are the ones who do not come before the Board,""


But she said it is a misconception that if the Review Board did not exist, businesses would be free to do whatever they wished. There are city-wide regulations, she said.


Sugimura cited two major accomplishments of the Board during her tenure on the Board: revisions in the development regulation density requirements to allow for construction of the two low-income housing projects; and the new Rainier Bank office building, originally conceived as a one-story bank.


She added that it is important at this point to get market-rate housing generated in the District, which would, in turn, encourage the survival of small businesses.

Review Board approves children's park design


The International District Special Review Board late last month approved the design concept for a children's playground park scheduled to be constructed in the District sometime next year.


The Seattle Design Commission, meanwhile, has approved the plans for the children's park.


At a May 22 meeting of the Review Board, Joey Ing & Associates, the firm contracting with the City to design the park, unveiled plans for the playground park. Joey Ing told the Review Board that the park, to be built at 7th Ave. and S. Lane, would not only provide a play area for the kids living in the District, but would also encourage more families to move into the District, knowing their children would have a safe play area.


Unlike Hing Hay Park, said Ing, the children's park has more landscaping. The tentative plans for the park include: a stone wall surrounding the park, to be named ""The Great Wall""; a 10-foot-high stone mountain, to be ""The Volcano""; two slides, one leading into a bamboo grove, the other leading into a sandlot; two drinking fountains; a suspension bridge; a pavilion; a sand dragon; and a manual, turntable merry-go-round.


The Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation will hold a public meeting to review design plans for the park Wednesday, June 20 at the Wing Luke Memorial Museum, 418-8th Ave. S. The meeting will begin at 7:30 p.m.


Eat pancakes and help your community


On June 3, the Incorporated Asian Student Coalition (IASC) of Seattle area high schools held a ""pancake breakfast"" to raise money for the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) Youth Fund and the International District Emergency Center.


Organizers of the breakfast hope to raise five to seven hundred dollars from the breakfast. An exact figure was unknown at press time, but all involved are expecting success. For a $2.50 donation, a person could have pancakes, eggs and ham. Senior citizens and children under six got in free.


This was the third annual breakfast sponsored by the IASC. In past years, the IASC sponsored a turkey dinner in the International District.


Last year, the breakfast raised nearly nine hundred dollars and proceeds were donated to the Denise Louie Child Care Center and the JACL Youth Fund.


HUD approves District as Neighborhood Strategy Area


The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently approved Seattle's proposal to establish a Neighborhood Strategy Area program in the International District.


The goal of the program is to work with property owners on rehabilitation of buildings, to provide up to 450 housing units and improved commercial space. Another objective is to avoid the displacement of current residential or business tenants in buildings which undergo rehabilitation.


Both subsidized housing under the federal Section 8 substantial rehabilitation program, and market-rate units using Section 312 financing will be sought. Based upon a survey completed last year, the demand by Asians for market-rate housing in the ID appears strong. Economic Research Associates, study consultants, found that the demand for apartments and condominiums in the ID approaches 200 to 260 units per year.


Over the five-year program, the City will provide approximately 1.8 million dollars in Community Development Block Grant funds for social services, housing and related public improvements. HUD will provide 225 Section 8 substantial rehabilitation units...


The City will be seeking proposals for 34 Section 8 units next month. Interested property owners should call Al Kurimura at 625-4496.


Asian Coalition to develop elderly resource center


The Pacific/Asian Coalition (PAC) early last month was awarded $70,926 by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Administration on Aging. With the money, PAC will develop a national Pacific/Asian Elderly Resource Center Development Project.


PAC National Coordinator Roy Hirabayashi said the initial project will run from March 1 to October 31. If it is successful, he said, the Elderly Resource Center Development Project would be funded for an additional two or three years.

The International District Special Review Board ""is hurting the community and not helping,"" stated Ed Burke, owner of the Chinatown Tours, ""so we should do away with the regulations and the Board.""


But Diane Sugimura, chairperson of the ID Special Review Board, said, ""Without some kind of control, the uniqueness of the ID would be lost...it would be just another extension of Downtown.""


Since its inception in 1973, the Review Board has been embroiled in controversy, surviving serious challenges to its authority.


In early 1978, Chinese property owners charged the Board with impeding development and threatening the identity of the Chinese community. A petition called for removal of the King Street core from the jurisdiction of the Board. However, Mayor Charles Royer announced support for the Review Board. His action mitigated fears the Board would be abolished.


Later that year, property owners in a three-block area in the north part of the District petitioned to have their property removed from the Board's jurisdiction. Ed Burke was among them. But the City Hearing Examiner ruled against the petition, keeping the disputed area in the ID Special Review District.


Today, the Review Board is in the process of re-evaluating its goals and guidelines. ""It's really time to look back and see whether our goals and objectives of 1973 still hold,"" stated Sugimura.


How did the Board first come about?


In the early 1970's, residents and business people in the ID feared the Domed Stadium project would usher in mass parking lots and big business at the expense of the ID's small businesses and ethnic character.


A task force was set up, said Al Kurimura, ID District Manager, which recommended: a street-scaping plan, establishment of a City staff position, and zoning controls to maintain the ethnic qualities and keep out harmful external forces. At the time, individual financing for business projects was hard to come by, he said, so it was recommended that the City ""act as a catalyst to private development."" The City supplied the Board with a technical assistance, but gave no direct money to operate programs, said Kurimura.


After many public meetings, the City's Department of Community Development (DCD) drafted plans for establishment of an International District Special Review Board in 1973. There were to be seven members, five elected by the community and two appointed by the Mayor. The Board's main responsibilities were to develop and recommend guidelines and land use for the ID, review building applications, and advise the Mayor, City Council and City Departments on ID developments.


Kurimura said the Review Board is ""a mechanism by which...the community can let its feelings be felt in DCD. You have a way of controlling external impacts which come into the ID."" The zoning laws can be changed, he said, and the kinds of development and where they can occur can be controlled.


Regulations 'too technical'


The main problem with the Review Board, say Board members, community members and City staff, is that development regulations are too technical. ""The regulations are pretty minute and confusing,"" stated Greg Ptucha, staff person for the ID Special Review Board. The Board members, who ""aren't design people,"" must ask City staff people for technical interpretations, he said. And in the long run, DCD ends up making all the decisions, he added.


Glenn Chinn, vice-chairperson of the Board, said the Review Board needs more members who will speak out and ask questions when they don't understand an issue. When he was a member of the original Board in 1973, Chinn recalled, ""We came out and said we didn't understand (an issue). We forced City staff to come out and explain things before we made a decision.""


Another related problem, said Burke, is that ""the sign ordinance is a pure Caucasian, middle-class perception of what's acceptable."" Burke said the sign ordinance restricts the expression of ethnic diversity. Yet, argued Burke, freedom of expression and the resultant ethnic variety are what make a Chinatown unique. Kurimura agreed. ""We started off on the wrong premise,"" he said, ""by assuming the ID had homogeneity.""


The mishmash of a San Francisco Chinatown is great, said Sugimura. ""And yet from a City-side point of view, we would like to have a little say since we have put money into a development.""


The Review Board is unfair to property owners by restricting parking in the ID, said Bill Montgomery, a trustee of the William Chappell Trust, which does business under the name of Rainier Heat and Power Company. ""People who live in the ID are not a wealthy people,"" he said. ""Various businesses are dependent on outsiders to come in and spend money. Most people don't like to ride buses and walk. You have to make it easy on them and provide parking.""


People, not cars


When making decision on development plans, countered Chinn, the Board envisions a prosperous residential-business district. The ID must be attractive and appealing so that people want to come and walk around in an ethnic atmosphere of modern convenience, he said. The ID needs to attract people, not cars, he said, and buildings should be fixed, not torn down.


Other critics question the objectivity of Board members and procedures by which Board members are elected.


Recently Paul Woo wrote a letter to DCD Director Darel Grothaus. He wrote that Board members who were also government employees might possibly face a conflict of interest. He was obviously referring to Chairperson Sugimura, who works in the City's Office of Policy Planning (OPP).


Sugimura explained how she acquired her dual role. ""When I first ran for the Board...I wasn't working for the City,"" she recalled. Later she changed jobs and became a City employee. She asked her boss whether she should resign from the Review Board, she said, and her OPP superior checked on it and said she did not have to resign. However, she said, there have been times when her job with the City hindered her ability to speak out on issues. She has not encountered any serious problems in making Board decisions yet, she said, but it is very frustrating trying to avoid a conflict of interest. She said that because of this she has decided not to run for re-election this month.


Who should vote?


Woo also wrote that voting for Board members should be opened up, allowing any adult ""community participant"" to vote. Sugimura said this would eliminate the rule which details voter eligibility, and then just about everyone in the District could vote. This would also eliminate the ruling for large organizations and family associations, she said, which specifies only two officers of such a group can vote. Sugimura said Woo's suggestion would allow large organizations such as Chong Wah (Woo is a member) or family associations to vote en mass. ""This could get out of hand,"" she said. As a case in point, she explained, an organized block vote would obviously cancel out an individual vote.


Responding to Woo's letter, Grothaus explained a City ordinance which restricts voter eligibility to ""residents, persons who operate businesses, their employees and property owners of the special review district...""


Board members have often been criticized for ineptness. Most Board members do understand what's going on at the meetings, said Sugimura. ""But we have had a problem this year because of attendance. Normally we have seven members, but we need four for a quorum."" This has been difficult to get this year, she said, because some Board members have had serious health problems, business trips, and conflicting time schedules.


Board members attend meetings every two weeks, she said, and the average meeting lasts about two hours. The amount of time a Board member puts in depends on the project, she said. Some projects require just the general meeting time; more difficult projects require outside work such as additional reading and research, remarked Sugimura.


Voluntarily spending so much time, with little acclaim and a lot of criticism, she said, the Board members have to be really concerned with what happens in the community.


Overhauling the Review Board


Policy planning, said Ptucha, should be the focal point of the Special Review Board. Kurimura said decisions should be made on whether a building should be developed, not on what color or size it should be.


""Right now there's a lot of animosity, specifically about the sign ordinance,"" said Ptucha. The community blames the Board for being too restrictive, he said, but does not understand the restrictions the Review Board has to work with. Sugimura said the regulations are very limiting and oftentimes too technical. The Board can only approve or disapprove projects, she commented, and yet so many projects are exceptions to the rules. ""Nobody wants restrictions, but whenever something gross goes up, it's the Board's fault,"" she stated.


Ptucha said the Board must ""provide incentives for the kind of changes we want done and want to prohibit. (We must) create a new dialogue between the Review Board and the community."" He said there is too much of a negative emphasis on the Review Board's role in the community. ""We really have more common goals and achievements,"" stated Ptucha.

Seattle Congressman Mike Lowry will shortly introduce a bill to address the issue of internment of Japanese-Americans by the U.S. government during World War II.


The legislation, currently being redrafted because of input from concerned citizens within the Asian community, proposes a direct payment to all people interned or certain specified heirs in the amount of $15,000 plus $15 per day of internment.


The bill also creates a trust fund that will allocate monies for educational, cultural and humanitarian projects of value and importance to the Japanese American community.


Congressman Lowry has also cosponsored HR 5499, a bill to establish a commission to look into the effects of internment on Japanese Americans.


""This in no way diminishes my strong commitment to my direct appropriations bill or lessen the amount of effort I will put into its passage,"" Congressman Lowry said. ""Rather, I feel the information and discussion engendered by the commission bill will offer timely arguments in support of the validity of my bill.""


Congressman Lowry said it is clear that Japanese Americans were subjected to a grievous injustice and denied constitutionally guaranteed rights when they were forced to leave family and friends, abandon homes and businesses and relocate or be interned. He noted that these facts are supported by easily obtainable government records.


""I view the airing of these truths through the commission vehicle in a positive light,"" he said. ""It will assist proponents of my bill in educating Congressional Representatives as well as the general public of the need for a direct appropriation for those interned.""


It is expected that developing allies within Congress to support redress will be a difficult struggle. Congressman Lowry asks the Asian community for their continuing involvement and support in the task that lies ahead.


Ruthann Kurose, a lifelong resident of Seattle, is the Senior Community Representative for Congressman Lowry's district office.

Early one morning, a 40-year-old male was shot twice inside the Red Front Tavern at South King St. Aid units and Emergency Center medics treated the victim. It is unknown why the man was shot. A woman was also slightly injured when the gun blast went off next to her eyes and ears. Police are looking into the case. The victim was in very serious condition at Harborview Medical Center.


A 40-year-old man was assaulted and thrown to the floor in the lobby of the Alps Hotel. Emergency Center medics treated the victim for a head injury.


On March 4, a Metro bus driver radioed into his dispatcher, ""I'm being fired on!"" The incident took place at Maynard and Jackson, the shots fired from the Bush Hotel. Police responded and shut off blocks around the hotel so other drivers would not be in danger. Officers made a door-to-door search of the hotel, but were unable to locate the weapon or the person who fired it. There were three arrests not related to the shooting.


Last month, a 35-year-old male was found shot to death on the west side of the Bush Hotel. Police are at a loss to find a motive for either shooting.


The same night as the sniper incident at the Bush Hotel, a 35-year-old female was assaulted by her husband in a pay phone booth. Aid units and Emergency Center medics were outside on another call and were notified of the occurence by hotel residents. The woman was not injured seriously. The husband was questioned and released.

In the 1700's the island of A waji was in the midst of a drought. The people journeyed to the temples and shrines to pray for rain but the drought continued. Under the orders of the prince of the region the puppet players performed a rain magic play and after seventeen days, it rained heavily.[*]


Puppets have long fascinated people. The inanimate combination of wood, paper, paint and glue comes to life in the hands of the puppeteer. As if by magic, human emotion is transferred from puppeteer to puppet.


Bunraku is a comprehensive form of Japanese art that combines puppets, storytelling, music and song. The narrator of chanter tells the entire story by singing and speaking for all the puppets.


Bunraku, a term in use since the 19th century, is more precisely known as Ningyo shibai (doll theatre) or Ayatsuri shibai (manipulation theatre).


Puppets were introduced to Japan in the 9th century. Since many puppeteers were foreigners for many years they were considered hinin or outcasts.


The early puppets were manipulated by hand. They were mainly used to tell simple stories to children, occasionally to perform at festivals.


Puppeteers took a giant step forward when they began to combine their talents with those of other artists. In the 15th century, the romantic tale of the hero Yoshitsune and the pearl-woman Jorui became the storytelling masterpiece. This twelve-part tale successfully combined the skills of storyteller, puppeteer and samisen player.


The soft strains of the samisen, a three-string guitar imported to Japan, enhanced the love story.


This convergence of talent, named Joruri after the beautiful woman in the story, became a vital force in Japanese puppet theatre.


A renowned storyteller in Tokyo originated another style of puppet theatre. This new style was full of fast-paced, violent action, exemplified by a fierce-natured main character, Kimpira. Kimpira could perform many devilish acts as well as the humanly impossible, flying through the air, for example.


Puppets used in this new style were often thrown violently around the stage. Eyeballs were mercilessly plucked out and skulls crushed. Replacement puppets were needed constantly.


As years passed, the abilities of the puppets increased. In the 1730's, puppets could move their eyes, eyebrows, and individual fingers, and could swell their stomachs. In 1747, they could move their ears.


The standard method of manipulating the puppets has remained basically unchanged since the 1730's. The leading puppeteer holds the doll by the back and operates eyes, eyebrows, mouth and right hand. The second man or first assistant operates the left hand. The third man or second assistant operates the feet of the puppet. Female puppets have no feet so the third man manipulates the skirt of the kimono to simulate walking. It is also the job of the third man to make the appropriate action noises, such as running, by shuffling and stomping his own feet.


Traditionally the puppet operator had to spend 10 years operating the puppet's feet and 10 years operating the left arm before assuming the principal role of lead operator. Training begins in childhood.


For the three operators to move as one while manipulating a puppet, they must all breathe together. Since puppets and operators appear on the stage together at the same time, the operators wear black hooded tunics with flaps over their faces to prevent detracting from the action of the puppets. The lead operator, however, may choose to wear a vividly colored and patterned costume.


The puppets may be up to one-third the size of a human. The heads of the puppets are carved from the wood of the paulownia tree, using techniques known only by certain families. The puppets have real hair that can by styled in some fifty different traditional ways to indicate their social position. There are good puppets and there are, of course, bad puppets. In general, each puppet head has a fixed personality, but there are exceptions.


One such puppet, Gabu, appears to be a beautiful young girl. With one quick movements, the operator can change the smiling girl into a demon, complete with horns, sharp teeth and red eyes.


By the middle of the 18th century the puppet theatre in Japan was overshadowing the popular Kabuki, Kabuki, a form of Japanese theatre combining song, dance and art, focuses on the artist playing the role rather than on the role itself. Some Kabuki artists decided that if the public wanted to see puppets perform they would merely suit the public by assuming the role of a puppet.


There are many adaptations and variations of the Japanese Bunraku. Examiner Arts spoke with Professor Aurora Valentinetti of the University of Washington School of Drama, who is familiar with Bunraku and some of its current adaptations. She is involved with the reorganization of the Seattle Chapter of the Puppeteers of America.


The upcoming ""Imagination Celebration"" at the Seattle Center, May 13 to 19, will feature the world of puppetry. For more information, contact, Valentinetti at the University of Washington, Room 51 Drama-TV Building BH-20, or call 543-5185.

An American soldier limps through the jungle, grimacing in pain as he avoids coils of barbed wire. Along with the sound of bombs exploding in the distance he hears a young woman's voice. He aims his gun at the Vietnamese woman who wanders, dazed, into the clearing, reciting a mumbled prayer. . . .


This is the opening scene of William Packard's War Play, in its West Coast premiere at the Ethnic Cultural Theatre. War Play is a glimpse at the brutality of war and the pain its victims must suffer. Under the careful direction of John Kauffman, the suffering is brought to life through the soldier, played by Phil Walth, and the young Vietnamese woman, played by Bea Kiyohara.


They are separated by culture, but joined in their losses. The soldier and the woman each have a way of coping with frustration and confusion. The soldier expresses his uncertainty by threatening to shoot or rape the woman, but does neither since ""I ain't got no instructions."" The woman fervently prays, ""so that everything is okay."" She does not know her prayer, ""Our Nothing who are in Nothing,"" is a blasphemized version of The Lord's Prayer. While he was alive, her lover, ""the soldier with the sad eyes inside,"" taught her the prayer.


As the play continues, the audience learns just how much the man and the woman have suffered as they describe their experiences in shocking detail. The language is coarse and the acting intense. Kiyohara and Walsh sensitively combine vulnerability and strength in both characters. One is touched by the lives of two real people rather than actors on a stage.


Examiner S&S spoke with actress Bea Kiyohara about War Play after the opening night performance. Kiyohara is a leading, actress with the Asian Exclusion Act in Seattle and has appeared in several productions, most notably And The Soul Shall Dance, Nisei Bar and Grill and Gold Watch. With the Womyn's Theater, she wrote and performed a one woman piece, Leavings.


Kiyohara auditioned for the role of the Asian woman in War Play and was surprised when she got the part. ""I didn't think I'd get the part since I knew it needed to be played by someone young,"" she said.


Kiyohara is aware that she is an Asian woman portraying an Asian woman of another culture. ""I don't want to misrepresent Vietnamese women,"" she said. ""And I don't want to show cultural stereotypes. I worked with a Vietnamese student and tapes of her voice so I could learn to imitate the inflections in her voice. The squatting position I use in the play is a mannerism I learned is typical of the rural people.""


To Kiyohara, the message of War Play is faith -- having it and losing it. ""An unusual part of the play is when the young woman forces the soldier at gunpoint to hop on his infected and bloody foot while she prays to cure him,"" she said. ""Why make him hop on his foot in the first place? We see her conviction that through prayer -- through her faith and his -- he will get well.""


War Play plays Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8 p.m. now through February 24 at the Ethnic Cultural Theater, N.E. 40th St. and Brooklyn Ave. N.E. General admission is $3, Students with ID, $2. For more information call 543-4635.

The City Hearing Examiner early this month ruled that King County does not need a conditional use permit from the City Council before going ahead with its plan to house a work-release program in the Immigration and Naturalization Service Building (INS).


The County wants to lease the second floor of the INS Building to hold up to 85 work-release inmates. The second floor has previously been used as a detention center for undocumented workers.


City Hearing Examiner William Snell, reversing an earlier decision of the Building Department, held that the County's proposed facility ""is a minimum security jail which has as its primary element a work-release program."" Since there is already a jail on the second floor of the INS, Snell argued, the ""proposed King County use would not result in a change of use.""


On June 22, the Building Superintendent had ruled that a work-release center ""physically separate from but administered by a public jail is not a jail ""and, therefore, requires Council conditional use approval.


The County appealed the Building Department interpretation, bringing the matter before the Hearing Examiner.


The Hearing Examiner's decision is a victory for the County, which is exploring ways of easing overcrowded conditions among work-release inmates at the King County Courthouse downtown.


International District organizations have complained that the County has not adequately addressed District concerns about the impact of a work-release center so close to the International District.


The Hearing Examiner did rule, however, that if the County were to propose leasing the entire INS Building for an expanded work-release program of 300 inmates, conditional use approval would be required.


James Coughlin, director of the County Department of Rehabilitative Services, said an environmental impact statement addressing the possible use of the entire building would be published in the very near future.

Carter appoints two Asians to high government positions


President Carter recently appointed two Asian Americans to high government positions, a representative of the Democratic National Committee told The Examiner earlier this month.


Joji Konishima, director of the Asian Affairs Unit for the Democratic National Committee, said Carter has appointed Asians to the Select Commission on Immigration and Refuge Policy, and the Census Bureau for California and Hawaii.


The appointments were first hinted at by Chip Carter, the President's son, late last month. Carter, speaking to about 60 persons at the Kawabe House, was here to solicit backing for his father's re-election bid and to find out concerns of different communities, keeping his father from ""becoming isolated.""


Congressman Mike Lowry's office, responding to a presidential request, agreed to help set up the visit as a matter of Congressional courtesy.


Besides mentioning the appointments, Carter asked for the names of qualified Asian Americans from this area for possible appointment to high government positions, national boards and commissions.


Chip Carter, asked about priority in funding for bilingual social services, said his father has ""generally been supportive of bilingual services for Asian Americans,"" but that he would have to have more information before he could respond to a specific funding proposal strategy.


Filipinos protest prosecution of California doctor


Earlier this month, a Filipino doctor in California went on trial, charged in connection with the death of a baby who had been the victim of child abuse by his father.


Dr. Bienvenido Alona Jr., charged with nine counts of criminal perjury, has been accused of medical negligence in treatment of the child, who suffered burns inflicted by the father.


The Seattle Chapter of the National Committee for the Defense of Dr. Alona has sent over 250 petition signatures and 100 telegrams to the District Attorney's office in the past several weeks, protesting that the prosecution of Alona involves racial and national discrimination by the District Attorney's office and the Navy.


The first two days of the trial, which began in a Ventura County superior court on October 3, involved jury selection. Opening statements began October 5.


David Della, of the National Committee for the Defense of Dr. Alona, said, ""The evidence is all very shaky, based on a number of oral statements. There was also gross miscommunication in the Federal Bureau of Investigation interview of Dr. Alona.""


Della said an educational on the Dr. Alona case is being organized for the near future. For more information, call Della, 325-7625.


Federal agency refunds food co-op


The International District Food Buying Club recently announced plans to continue its program, which provides food for ID residents at a 10-15 percent discount.


Last month, Inter*Im's request for funds were denied by the Community Services Administration (CSA).


Charlie Chong, chief of operations for CSA explained that grant applicants were evaluated by a competitive scoring process, due to limited funds. He stated that Inter*Im was later awarded a $22,000 grant as a priority alternate when funds became available.


Dalai Lama: 'Happiness is in ourselves'


His Holiness the Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people, visited Seattle October 4 to 6, one of the cities on his United States itinerary.


The Dalai Lama, presently in exile in India, spoke at the University of Washington's Meany Hall to an overflow crowd. His message was for nations and individuals to seek love, compassion, and peace internally and with each other. ""The real source of happiness is in ourselves,"" he said.


In 1959, his Holiness sought asylum in India after the Chinese crushed the Tibetan people's national uprising in Lhasa. The Dalai Lama's followers number about six million. There are an estimated 300 Tibetan refugees in the United States. About 40 people form the closely-knit Tibetan American community in Seattle and Bellevue.


Police relations advisory committee


An Asian advisory committee on police relations will work to get the Seattle Police Department to implement recommendations formulated by the committee last year, according to Mark Della.


Della and attorney Diane Wong are cochairs of the committee, which has recommended increased recruiting of Asian officers and establishing a language bank, for Asians who need bilingual officers to provide assistance.


Della said the police chief and the mayor have met with the committee and approved the recommendations. The committee recently put together by-laws, said Della, ""and now we're at a starting point.""


The committee was scheduled, earlier this month, to meet and discuss the recently announced decision of Mayor Charles Royer to recommend funding of an additional 41 positions for uniformed officers and 20 civilian positions in next year's budget.


Demonstrators denounce Marcos dictatorship


Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and President Jimmy Carter were burned in effigy by about 30 Seattle demonstrators in front of the Philippine Consulate General on September 21. The demonstration, staged by the Seattle Anti-Martial Law Alliance, marked the seventh anniversary of the Marcos dictatorship.


The demonstrators denounced continued United States support of Marcos, including renewed American commitment of $500 million over the next five years. The protesters said the money to Marcos is in exchange for the right to maintain military bases in the Philippines and to protect $3 billion in American business interest, including copper and aluminum mining.


From the Consulate at 810 Third Avenue, the marchers walked to Hing Hay Park in the International District for a rally.


Cannery Workers Union ousts secretary-treasurer


Ponce Torres, controversial Secretary-Treasurer of the Seattle International Longshoremen's Worker Union-Local 37 (IL WU), was recalled by union members by a 170 to 70 vote. The results of the referendum recall was announced at a special membership meeting September 12.


Former union dispatcher Rudy (Amin) Abella was narrowly confirmed to fill the vacant office on September 19 by a narrow 7-6 and one abstention vote in the union's Executive Council. Abella's confirmation became official following a union membership meeting that same afternoon.


The September 12 announcement brought the Torres recall campaign to a conclusion four months after union members petitioned for his recall. Torres was charged with inaccurate and inconsistent financial reports, failure to maintain official minutes and records of meetings and failure to keep an updated union membership list.


Library assists non-English-speaking


The Seattle Public Library's Adult Reading and Enrichment Center (ARE) is providing materials to assist non-English speaking residents ""cope with day-to-day survival,"" said Lynn Daniel, librarian.


Daniel, who developed the two-year-old collection, said it contains reading materials, film strips and cassette tapes to help those to whom Engish is a second language, persons who have difficulty with basic reading skills and the mentally handicapped.


The materials include: help with learning to use money and banks, shopping and consumer information; how to get a driver's license, or a job and how to apply for citizenship. Puzzles, games and flash cards are available to those working with tutors.


The Education Department of the Downtown Library will also refer users to tutors when requested. Staff can assist in contacting other agencies for help with housing, child care, medical needs and social services.


Asian mental health needs to be researched


Seattle will be one of nine cities targeted for research into the mental health needs of Pacific American communities, according to the Pacific Asian Coalition (PAC).


PAC, a national human services advocacy and research organization based in San Francisco, has been awarded a three-year grant of $600,000 by the National Institute of Mental Health of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.


With the grant, research will be conduced in cities with heavy concentrations of Pacific Asian Americans: Boston, Chicago, Denver, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle.


Specifically, the research will:


--define the priority mental health needs of Pacific Asian communities.


--assess the impact of community mental health centers upon Pacific Asian communities.


--analyze alternative models of mental health service delivery.


--identify the range of treatment methods utilized in mental health services to Pacific Asians.

Ishikawa, who gained his seat in the primary election, will not have to compete in the general election. The three other Asian candidates will battle their opponents in the November general election.


Of the three, Sibonga is most likely to be successful in her bid for office. She led the race for Council position 2 with 40 percent of the vote in the primary. Her opponent for the general election, conservative Bob Moffett, took 23.5 percent of the vote. The liberal votes that went to Walt Crowley and Nick Licata in the primary probably will go to Sibonga.


Horiuchi, in his race for Council position 4, faces an uphill battle against incumbent Sam Smith. Horiuchi cites name familiarity as a problem as does Hara. Hara, however, is confident; he points out that candidates such as Norm Rice and Michael Hildt have come from being behind in the primary to win the final. Hara says that in precincts where his campaign workers have doorbelled, he has done as well, if not better than his opponent, George Cooley, in the primary.


Both candidates, too, have not had the strong support from the Asian community Sibonga has had. Of course, Sibonga has been active in the Asian community; she was president of the Inter*Im Board of Directors, editor of the Filipino Forum newspaper, and involved in the Asian/Pacific Women's Caucus as well as other Asian organizations.


Sibonga also served as an interim Council member last year. ""There's a lot of work to be done in city government,"" says Sibonga. ""I have the qualifications. I know the process.""


Some issues Sibonga supports are: SJR 120 which would allow the city to fund weatherization of homes, getting people into high occupancy vehicles, increasing affordable housing and rehabilitation of multi-family units.


A newcomer to politics, Horiuchi spent primary night singing in the Opera House instead of watching election results. Watching the returns would not have changed the outcome, says Horiuchi.


Horiuchi says he would have liked the primary to be closer, but he feels he got as many votes as he was entitled to, considering the effort he put out, not to mention the competition he's up against.


""It's Sam Smith's attitude that I'm opposed to,"" says Horiuchi. ""His politics is just politics."" Horiuchi says Smith is a ""fence sitter"" who will jump off to whichever side is politically sound for him. ""He's not a bad Councilman,"" says Horiuchi, ""but he can do a lot more.""


Horiuchi would like to bring Council meetings to communities to increase participation. If people could see the Council in action, he said, they would be less apathetic.


Another big item on Horiuchi's list is the ""quality of life contributed by the arts."" He would see that adequate funding is spent on the Seattle Arts Commission and on parks.


Both Horiuchi and Sibonga would like to cut the red tape in the building process. Horiuchi would also like to give incentives to build low-income housing.


Hara feels the City Treasurer should be more of a public spokesman. ""The City Treasurer should consult the Mayor and the City Council and inform them what he thinks is best,"" says Hara. So far, there has been limited access between these offices.


If elected, Hara says he will make positive changes to update and modernize practices. He would make sure investments are consistent with City policy.


Hara, a Sansei, says no Japanese American has come close to winning a city office. ""There's a growing political activism in Asian Americans,"" says Hara. ""Asians have to get politically involved to secure the lifestyle and the influence.""


Hara says there is a large enough Asian population in Seattle that Asians should be well represented in city government. Hara also mentions that he has over 850 contributors, second only to Sibonga, who has the best-financed campaign.


All three candidates are supportive of the International District. Sibonga says she would like to see a balance between the commercial and the residential. However, as Horiuchi says, ""I don't want to be the mayor of the ID,"" realizing they, as candidates for city offices, have the whole city to think about.


Ishikawa's campaign worries are over, and he is glad. He didn't like campaigning.


""I'm not a politician,"" says Ishikawa. ""It's the first time I've ever been involved in a campaign. It's tiring. However, if I were to be put in this position again, I would.""


Ishikawa was sworn in as King County Superior Court Judge October 5. He won his one-year term by gathering 50 percent of the vote over Terrence A. Carroll, the incumbent who held the post for only month. In judicial races, any candidate gathering 50 percent of the vote automatically gets the position, no matter how many candidates are running. There were only two candidates for Position 11 so the primary decided the winner.


Ishikawa, 47, who was a King County court commissioner, says his old position had all the authority he has now, with the exception of handling criminal matters. It's a step up, says Ishikawa.

Taiwan publisher goes on protest hunger strike


New York (NY) -- Last month, the publisher of an anti-government newspaper in Taiwan went on a hunger strike in New York City to protest the arrest of two colleagues in Nationalist China.


Wan-jen Chen, co-founder of Chao Liu (Time), started camping out in front of the Nationalist Chinese Consulate General August 9 after she learned of the arrests. Chen, vacationing in New York at the time of the arrests, said she would continue the strike until the two are released.


According to Chen, reporter Yun-Chung Chen and printer Yu-rong Yang were arrested on August 7, shortly after Chao Liu printed an article that was critical of the regime in Taiwan.


The Taipei-born publisher, who drinks nothing but water and uses a foam pad and sleeping bag for her bed, said she would be willing to return to Taiwan and face arrest in exchange for the others' release.


Chen drafted an open letter to Nationalist China President Chiang Ching-Kuo demanding her colleagues' freedom and charging that he was ""totally insensitive to the suffering of the Taiwanese.""


UW Asian program director resigns


Larry Flores has resigned as director of the Asian Student Division of the University of Washington's Equal Opportunity Program. Flores, division director since June, 1976, cited personal reasons for his leaving.


Gradual changes in the Office of Minority Affairs (OMA) the past year made Flores believe he ""wasn't part of the picture anymore."" He was frustrated by a lack of input to program decisions and unsuccessful attempts to provide the division with additional staffing. Flores was the senior director, and started work with the OMA in June, 1972.


Flores resignation was effective June 15, Vic Pineda, who has also been in the division for seven years, became acting director. A screening process to fill Flores' position is underway and a new director is expected to be announced in another month.


Highest ranking Asian in the Federal Service


Frank Saburo Sato, graduate of the University of Washington, has been appointed Inspector General of the Department of Transportation. The appointment makes Sato the highest ranking Asian in the Federal Service.


The Inspector General -- who is responsible for Audit and Investigation -- is the primary Department watchdog over Department expenditures.


Sato said he had second thoughts about taking the position when it was first offered to him. ""But, I must admit that when the Vice President called me last January on behalf of the President and talked about needing my help to restore public confidence in government, I knew I wanted to be part of the team,"" he said.


Sato was the first racial minority elected to the Presidency of the Association of Government Accountants.


Sato said he would like to see more Nikkei in the Federal Service, believing strongly that it offers opportunities still relatively untapped by the Asian community.


Filipino alliance protests dictatorship


September 22 marks the seventh anniversary of the declaration of martial law in the Philippines. Under the Marcos dictatorship, the Filipino people have experienced worsening economic conditions and increasing political repression.


The United States continues to support Marcos while ignoring human rights violations in the Philippines. President Jimmy Carter has promised Marcos $500 million in military aid over the next five years.


To commemorate the anniversary and protest continued United States support for Marcos, there will be a picket September 21, at 3 p.m., at the Philippine Consulate, 810 Third Avenue. A rally will follow at 4:30 p.m. at Hing Hay Park, King and Maynard Streets.


On September 23, an education forum will be held at the Filipino Community Center, 5740 Empire Way South, at 2 p.m. The picket and the forum are sponsored by the Seattle Anti-Martial Law Alliance, Friends of the Filipino People, and the Union of Democratic Filipinos.

America's Asian elderly, including a sizeable group in the Northwest, are growing in number. The Pacific Asian Elderly Project is working to meet this group's increasing health and social needs.


Seattle Asian community activist Don Kazama initiatied the federally-funded project last fall with an office in the ID. The project's initial effort is a regional conference planned for spring, 1979. The conference will involve health and social service providers, government agencies and elderly from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Goals sought include:


--providing information regarding the needs of Pacific/Asian elderly to a wide audience of decision makers, service providers and consumers


--recommending means by which existing elderly programs can be improved and new programs developed to address unmet elderly needs


--developing resource information on available services for distribution to Pacific/Asian elderly consumers and potential consumers


--developing a network among service providers to the Pacific/Asian elderly community, and developing ongoing contact between such providers and regional and national decision makers.


The project is an outgrowth of the Pacific/Asian Elderly Research Project, a two-year effort which culminated in a national research dissemination conference in Los Angeles in May, 1978, Kazama also was chairman of that project. Its findings concluded that the ""Pacific/Asian community typically has been, and continues to be, the most neglected of ethnic minority communities.""


""There was a need for some kind of effort on behalf of the Pacific/Asian elderly,"" Kazama said of the Seattle project. Kazama especially hopes for coordination between agencies providing services to the Asian elderly. ""The churches do it a little bit,"" Kazama said. ""Each group does its little thing,"" but what is needed, he believes, is cooperation and an information network between service providers and planners to insure equitable distribution of existing services.


Several International District community leaders are on the project's advisory committee, including Bob Santos, Tomio Moriguchi, Jon Nakagawara, Al Masigat, Dave Okimoto, and Don Chin.


Nakagawara is director of the ID Community Health Center. ""There is less attention paid to specifically Asian elderly needs,"" he said, agreeing with the Los Angeles Project's findings. ""The existing programs are geared to the general population. They don't take into consideration the language problems, the mental problems (of the Asian elderly)."" He said that other considerations include their particular ""diet, home environment, and background.""


Nakagawara estimates that 45 percent of the Health Center's clients are Asian elderly. ""The (Asian elderly) population is growing,"" he said. ""Those people who are in their late middle age will be retiring to the point where they will be needing services such as congregate care. There is a need for developing specific programs such as nutritional counseling (and hypertension counseling). There are plenty of areas to work on.""


Moriguchi, former president of Keiro Nursing Home, believes that elements within the Asian elderly group aggravate the situation. This would include, Moriguchi said, ""the stigma of not wanting a handout."" Many Asian elderly have been independent and self-reliant, and feel elderly service programs are not for them.


""We have to break that barrier,"" Moriguchi said. He hopes to see definite, programs resulting from the upcoming conference. ""It's time for more hard delivery, actual delivery of services,"" he said. ""People have to quit talking and start delivering.""


Bob Santos, director of Inter*Im, speaks of the project's importance to the ID. ""One goal,"" he said, ""is to help those service delivery agenoies that would be involved of the types of programs they should be involved with down here.


""In terms of service-related programs that serve the elderly (including the area agency on aging), we really don't get that much involvement from them.""


""When you're dealing with programs for the elderly, you've got to get as much as you can,"" Santos said.


The Seattle conference is scheduled March 23-24. Registration fee is $10. Those interested in attending should contact either Jean Mercliff or Hannah Hirabayashi before January 29. They can be reached at 623-5088.

The Seattle Police Department is recruiting Asian women as decoys to snare potential ""johns"" coming through the International District. The police hope this temporary strategy will drive away the steadily magnifying problem of prostitution in the District.


Police Department representatives met late last month with several community leaders to discuss prostitution and what steps the police should take to alleviate the problem.


""Let's have some visible patrol down here,"" Inter*Im Director Bob Santos angrily told the police. ""If the police are visible, the prostitutes are not going to be working the streets. Then they're not going to be making money and they're going to be out of the area.""


Santos said the community was tired of women employees of the District ""being hassled, whistled at and grabbed.""


C.B. Elster, commander of the Central Precinct Patrol Bureau, said the police will try decoy programs during the next few weeks, but he said it was only a temporary solution. ""This own is jumping and we're in a brushfire situation, moving from one place to another, usually after the brushfire is already over.""


""We're spinning our wheels,"" said Elster. The prostitutes are in jail for an hour, he said, and then right back out on the streets. ""There is no such thing as a rehabilitive prostitute,"" he said.


""There are more permanent types of solutions, but the community has not indicated it's ready for it,"" he said. ""One way to do it is to put the prostitute in jail and leave her there. If they are in jail, they're not making money. If they're not making money, they're of no use to their pimps.""


The problem, Elster and the other police representatives argued, is that judges think prostitution is harmless, a victimless crime.


""Legally we can't touch the pimps,"" Elster said. ""And they know it so they don't have to conceal it. The girls are slaves. We can work the patrol car here, but they know what our limitations are.""


Paul Knapp, also of the Seattle Police Department, said that out of the thousands of johns arrested, only two have been repeat offenders. It is embarrassing to have to explain to your wife what you have been doing, he said.


Seattle is ""an easy town,"" said Elster, compared with Yakima where prostitutes are jailed and sentenced. He said Seattle has to establish a reputation for not permitting prostitution. He disagreed that legalizing prostitution would improve the situation. ""Just changing the odor of the skunk doesn't make it into perfume,"" he said.


McDonald Sullivan, executive director of the Chinatown-International District Public Authority which is renovating the Bush Hotel into a community center, said the hotel management has taken clear steps to screen hotel visitors and keep track of who goes into the hotel. Those under 18 will not be checked into the hotel, he said. Most of the prostitutes in the District are ""teenyboppers,"" according to police.

While the audience watched, Jose Aruego's whimsical and colorful comic animals burst onto the screen, playing hide-and-seek in an East African landscape. Aruego is a nationally known children's book author and illustrator. He was in Seattle recently to help celebrate Children's Book Week at the downtown Seattle Public Library.


Aruego was born in Manila, the Philippines, where he studied law. Art was not considered the ideal career in the Philippines, he said. Yet after a brief law practice and to the dismay of his parents, he left the Philippines and went to New York to start his art career. He studied painting at Parsons School of Design in New York.


Later he traveled to Europe, where he explored line drawing, which is characteristic of his unique illustrations. Aruego's career included cartooning for the Saturday Evening Post, the New Yorker and other magazines. Those jobs helped launched his career in book illustration. He is currently one of only two Asians writing and illustrating children's books on a full-time basis.


According to Aruego, very few Asians become full-time children's authors because it is difficult to make a living and get established in the field. After ten years and 34 books, Aruego says he is still learning his craft and getting to know his audience.


Aruego has written some Philippine folk tales which appeal to children worldwide. Most of his works, however, are fantasy stories which are told mainly with illustrations. Little text and mostly illustrations stimulates a child's imagination, he said.


""In art one is judged more for your work, not by whether you are ethnic or not,"" Aruego said. ""It is better to illustrate first, then, after gaining a reputation, go into writing of children's books.""


In addition to his own books, Aruego illustrates the work of other authors, often collaborating with painter Ariane Dewey. Their seventh and newest creation is an almost wordless picture story. We Hide, You Seek. Other authors' works illustrated by Aruego include If Dragon Flies Made Honey and Never Say Ugh to a Bug.

""Something magic happened"" among high school students who gathered for an Asian awareness retreat last month, according to Mako Nakagawa, founder of the Seattle School District's Ethnic Cultural Heritage Program.


The retreat, held April 20 to 22 at Camp Parsons in the Olympic National Forest, was sponsored by the Associated Asian Student Coalition of the Seattle School District. According to Nakagawa, there were Asian students from West Seattle, Lincoln, Hale, Rainier Beach, Renton, Garfield, Franklin and Cleveland.


""We established the reality that Asians are beautiful people,"" said Nakagawa, who helped coordinate the retreat activities and speakers. ""Something magic happened when the kids got together and talked about Asian pride. They established a feeling between themselves and a trust level.""


Bea Kiyohara, who made a presentation on Asian American literature, said the students had different ""levels of Asian awareness"" depending upon the schools they attended and the number of Asian students at the schools.


""I told them,"" said Kiyohara, ""that if they wanted to find out about the Asian experience, they should look at Asian American literature. Some knew who Frank Chin was. Two had read No-No Boy.""


Said Chris Pabalate, a student at Nathan Hale High: ""It was fun. We learned we Asians are very important people."" Mike Yoshitomi, a student at Renton High School, said, ""It was fascinating. You got out of it what you put into it and it reinforced your feelings on your own Asianness.""


May Sasaki, another one of the retreat organizers said the main purpose of the three-day get-together was to have ""Asian togetherness pride-building.""


Among the speakers were Mike Davis, from the Ethnic Cultural Heritage Program, presenting a white perspective; Min Masuda, University of Washington professor, speaking about the World War II concentration camps for Japanese Americans; and Roy Flores, speaking about Asian pride.


""It was a very meaningful weekend for us and they're talking about doing it again for next year,"" said Sasaki.


Among the activities were skits on stereotyping and the American Dream. ""We got into some heavy topics,"" said Nakagawa. ""We talked about the difference between prejudice and discrimination. The kids learned a lot about racism.""


Daren Nakagawa, a student at Cleveland High School, said. ""It was an extremely exhilirating experience. We got first-hand knowledge of minority problems in the community.""

Two months ago, a 40-year-old male was found in a District hotel by residents. IDEC was called and found the male who apparently died from hanging. The body had been there several hours. It was believed a suicide and no foul play was indicated.


Some District youth found what seemed to be the contents of several purses and wallets. The contents were turned over to IDEC, which contacted the Seattle Police Department and the victims. IDEC returned the purses and wallets to their owners. Suspects were not located.


IDEC also recovered dozens of letters and other mail from alleyways. The items had apparently been stolen from mail boxes or mail slots. IDEC contacted the postal inspector who recovered the mail. If you have been expecting an item in the mail and it has not arrived for some time, please contact the International Station of the Post Office.


AID units and Emergency Center medics responded to a seizure victim in the lobby of the Publix Hotel. Medics treated the victim and he was sent to the hospital and released.


Late one evening at the Publix, a 45-year-old male cut both his wrists with a large knife. IDEC medics treated the person and he was transported to Harborview Medical Center by police. The person had been having family problems, according to witnesses.


Later than morning, a 39-year-old male was found lying in a gutter on Jackson Street. He was the apparent victim of a beating. The victim, cut with a knife, was treated by ambulance and IDEC medics. He is in Group Health. Police are looking into the case.


One night while crossing the street at the intersection of Maynard and Jackson, a 65-year-old male was struck by a truck. The victim was transported to Harborview Medical Center in very serious condition.


Late last month, the Fire Department responded to a reported fire at 12th and Jackson, near the old Baptist Church. Upon arrival, the fire was out. There was only minor damage. No injuries were reported.


The Fire Department called IDEC to check on a man down at Maynard and King early on the morning of April 9. IDEC medics found a 75-year-old male who had fallen and was slightly injured. The victim refused service, so IDEC gave him first aid and left.


IDEC was called to the American Hotel to check on a man who had respiratory problems. Upon arrival, IDEC called for an aid car to take the victim to Harborview Medical Center.

The Seattle School District is not providing quality health care to students, according to a former supervisor of Health Services who recently resigned. Sheila Umlauf said the School District is not ""providing a comprehensive health service and educational program.""


As part of the cutback in quality health care, there has been a hiring freeze on school nurses since Dr. David Moberly became superintendent of the School District in 1976. ""When someone quits or retires, we couldn't replace her,"" Umlauf said. At present, there are 48 nurses for 54,000 students.


Lloyd Tremain, an elementary school principal in West Seattle, said, ""Nurses are a very valuable part in the school building."" With the cutback, nurses spend only one or two days in an elementary school. Tremain added, ""That places an additional strain on the secretary and the principal who have many other responsibilities during the school day.""


Concern was expressed that school nurses were not being utilized to their full potential in providing services to the community. Dorothy Roth, an elementary school nurse, said, ""There is not enough, time to do adequate followup and home visitations with parents. Minority and poor children are affected most by the cutbacks since the school nurse usually has an important role in their health care.""


Umlauf added, ""I don't know why people don't understand that if a child is not healthy, he or she won't learn. Also, school nurses have been able to spot symptoms of child abuse and do followup in an effort to change conditions.""


Nurses also provided services to teachers in the past. ""Teachers are going through more stress than before, nurses would be able to work with them more,"" said Umlauf. ""Nurses would also provide medical advice to teachers, like explaining prescriptions or providing basic physical check ups. This would save the School District money, cutting down on the need for substitutes while teachers had medical appointments.""


Most school nurses have responsibility for covering two or three schools. Tericeta Aguiling received her training as a nurse in the Philippines, but has not yet received certification to become a school nurse. The National Alliance for Fair Licensure for Foreign Nurse Graduates (NAFL-FNG) on the East Coast has initiated campaigns to assist foreign nurses to become certified. Aguiling, a nurse trainee, said, ""I'm assigned to work, with a school nurse, at two middle schools and one elementary school during the week. I do health screenings, counsel students about their medical problems, and follow up with students. There is always a lot to do.""


Roth added, ""There's so much paperwork and we need to keep accurate records. What do you do?""


Mitsue Doniego, whose daughter is bused to a West Seattle elementary school, said, ""In Hawaii, the public school system is very strict about compiling accurate immunization records. They will not allow your child to enroll unless the immunization records are up to date. In Seattle, the school nurses do not have enough time to adequately organize the immunization records. I asked about my daughter's records when she became sick, but the nurse is so busy.""


Observers have pointed out that if the school levy fails again, then all school departments have been directed to prepare for at least a 10 to 20 per cent budget cut. ""I didn't think there was support for quality health care from the administration,"" Umlauf said.


""People take for granted that when their children go to school, someone will be there to take care of their health needs. With the cutbacks, that is not possible.""

Tenants at the Paul Revere Apartments, who got together last month to protest large rent increases, have decided to pay the increase after receiving eviction notices from the owner.


The majority of the 80 tenants at the Apartments, on 9th Ave. and Spring, are Filipino. Tenants had received monthly rent increases of $30 to $65. The increase followed a $10 to $15 hike in October.


Nearly all the tenants signed a petition to the owner protesting the rent increases as unreasonable. Fifteen tenants refused to pay the increase at the beginning of this month.


The tenants also formed the Paul Revere Tenants Committee.


Maria Penaranda, a four-year resident of the Apartments, lives with her mother and child. ""My rent has increased $60 a month,"" she said. ""But my wages have not."" She then wrote a letter to Donald Harvey, the owner of the building. ""He suggested I go on welfare,"" stated Penaranda.


At a recent press conference in front of the Apartments, tenants demanded a remedy for housing code violations such as leaky ceilings and outmoded plumbing. They also sought to cut back the recent increases to 10 percent and exempt elderly on fixed incomes from the increase.


""Landlords are not getting out of the housing business,"" said Shari Woo, of the International District Housing Alliance (IDHA), one of the sponsors of the press conference. High land values downtown, she explained, have a ""ripple effect"" on the value of communities in the central city.


Harvey refused to meet with tenants in the initial phase of the tenant protest. As a result, tenants with held rent increase payments until problems could be resolved.


To stop tenant organization, tenants say Harvey used ""divide and conquer"" tactics by giving eight senior citizens a 50 percent reduction of the rent increase.


For the first time, tenants say, Harvey personally collected rents earlier than they were due.


""He went from room to room collecting because he knows the tenants are weak individually,"" remarked one resident. ""But together, we are strong.""


On April 4, tenants received a three-day eviction notice to either pay or vacate the apartments. This was followed by a letter from Harvey which read: ""If you are willing to pay the increase, I will fix those complaints as soon as possible, and if we can't fix them within one month, you will get your apartment at the old rate, until they are done."" Harvey promised rent stabilization for at least one year.


Upon receiving the proposal, the tenants decided to pay the increase.


""The tenants see themselves as winning a victory here,"" said Woo. Tenant organization was a key force in winning promises to remedy housing code violations, Woo said.


Although tenants say they still believe the rent increase was unjustified, they have refrained from legal action because ""there are no rent stabilization laws in the City of Seattle"" to protect them from rent increases.


Woo urged supporters to write letters to City Councilmember Michael Hildt, who has committed himself to a study of housing problems.

Organization of Chinese Americans


Immigration to the United States is clearly an issue of highest priority among Chinese Americans. About half of the Chinese in America are immigrants themselves. In our community, the family continues as the strongest sociological unit, and the desire to reunite their families separated by oceans and for years has never been more important than today.


United States immigration laws, however, have discriminated against the Chinese in America throughout most of American history. From 1882 to 1943, the disgraceful Chinese Exclusion Acts cut off Chinese immigration -- including wives and children -- while also denying basic human rights to Chinese Americans, rights such as land ownership and the vote. The National Origins Quota of 1924, which reinforced the Exclusion Acts, ""virtually condemned the Chinese in the United States to a life of forced celibacy, bachelorhood, or trans-Pacific marriages,"" as one historian has phrased. Again, in 1952, the McCarran-Walter Act maintained the racially discriminating National Origins Quota and incorporated additional provisions directed at Asiatics, provisions which President Truman in his veto message deemed as ""without justification.""


Immigration has always been a vital element in the pursuit of happiness by the Chinese in America; current events reestablish immigration policy as the highest priority to our Chinese American communities. In fiscal year 1977, 25,396 immigrants to the United States were born in either Hong Kong, Taiwan, or China. Tens of thousands of Indochinese refugees recently admitted to this country are of Chinese ethnicity, and they maintain strong cultural and linguistical ties to the Chinese community. The recent establishment of full diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China brings about a concern among Chinese Americans over future immigration policy towards both Taiwan and China. Furthermore, the 600 subquota for dependent countries has created a backlog of over ten years for visa applications for those born in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. For these reasons, Chinese Americans clearly have a deep concern over our nation's immigration policies.


Repealing of Section (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Subquotas for colonies) -- In 1953, the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization found this section of the law to ""have the effect of deliberately discriminating on account of race and color to such an extent as practically to deny all immigration, except for a token amount, to the people in the areas described."" This subquota of 600 has created an unwarranted wait of over ten years for visas to Hong Kong-born Chinese. Chinese Americans strongly contend that this was intended as a racist provision and should be repealed.


Establishment of a board of immigration and visa appeals -- Consular officers currently have the power to issue or to deny immigration visas without review. There exists no appeals process. Reports which have shown subsequent corruptive practices and unsubstantiated denial of visas have created an outrage among Chinese Americans. We strongly urge the establishment of a visa appeals process.


Amnesty to undocumented aliens -- We support the Administration's proposal to grant amnesty to all undocumented aliens who resided in the United States prior to a chosen year. We recommend January 1, 1973 as the cut-off date.


Employer sanctions opposed -- The proposals to establish penalties against employers who hire undocumented aliens will lend to discriminatory practices by employers. We strongly oppose these proposals.


Federal assistance programs to areas with heavy concentrations of foreign-born persons -- Educational, employment, and other assistance programs are needed to areas such as New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, where high concentrations of foreign-born Chinese are settling.


Reunion of families from the Peoples Republic of China -- Many Chinese Americans have immediate relatives in the Peoples Republic with whom reunion is greatly desired. We believe that an emphasis should be placed on this matter.


Increased hiring of bilingual personnel and expanded bilingual assistance programs at the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- Both bilingual materials and personnel would aid in bettering the understanding between the INS and the Chinese American communities, and generally between the Federal government and its peoples. Also, increased staffing for the INS would alleviate the backlogs in research and applications as well as establishing a more humane agency between the government and its peoples.


Revamping of refugee policy -- Increased funds for the processing of refugees into the United States and for locating sponsors for them. Establishment of more flexible laws for the admittance of refugees would aid in avoiding crisis situations such as that which occurred over the Indochinese refugees.

""You can't ignore so large a land and so many people,"" May Wan said of the normalization of United States-China relations. ""It's not a good thing or a bad thing, it's called for. It's mutually beneficial.""


The International Examiner interviewed people throughout the community to get opinions on normalization of relations. The general consensus is that recognition is a political reality, it will help both countries in economic, technological and social development, the alliance will act as a deterrent to global war, and Taiwan's future autonomy is not very secure. The people interviewed have one thing in common: they are all Chinese. Here the similarity ends. Their political and personal differences reflect their diverse backgrounds: American-born, Taiwanese-born, and mainland-born.


May Wan left the People's Republic of China in 1958 when she was 10 years old. ""I was the daughter of the country,"" she said. ""I didn't want to come out. I was brainwashed."" She settled in Canada and is now an American citizen. She said these different lifestyles gave her a better perspective of communist, socialist, and capitalist working systems.


Building Block Process


""It's good from a Chinese point of view,"" said Wan of the normalization. ""Now they can progress in time and not spend all their time with propaganda. In the beginning, leaders were trying to carry out an idea [communism] and they had to narrow down the priorities to carry out the mutual goal (a united, communist China). It was necessary for this action for so many people. China has had a history of division . . . the only way to resolve it was totalitarianism. The last 20 years has been a building block process. Now that she's united, she's ready to branch out.""


""It's a new China right now,"" explained Amy Chan, May Wan's mother. ""China needs some changes. It's a big country with a large population. In the last few years, things have improved.""


""There's a lot of people who don't understand about China, her business, economics, people-to-people needs . . . China has much to do to develop herself,"" stated David Lau, a member of the Seattle Chapter of the National Association of Chinese Americans. Lau was one of the Chinese Americans who met privately with Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-ping in Seattle.


The Peking government and the Taiwan Nationalist government each claim to be the legitimate government of the Chinese people. Many University of Washington students from Taiwan worry that normalization may have adverse consequences on Taiwan's future autonomy. They fear that China will now try to conquer Taiwan.


You Have A Brother


""In the long run I would like to see one China,"" said Sue Fin, a University of Washington (UW) business student from Taiwan. ""But in the short run, I'm worried about the people in Taiwan. My family is over there. Two Chinas are not meaningful to me. It's like you have a brother, and you know you have the same parents but you cannot recognize each other.""


""First you're Chinese regardless of what you call yourselves (i.e., political beliefs, geographic location),"" stated David Lau. ""China is my motherland. Taiwan belongs to China. To me, I wouldn't call the people in Taiwan, Taiwanese. I would call them Chinese. It's like saying, 'I am a Washingtonian, not an American.' That's an insult. The Taiwanese Independence Movement comes from a small group that cannot represent all the people."" (The Taiwanese Independence Movement is comprised of native Taiwanese who seek self-determination for the people on Taiwan.)


The ideological differences constitute a concrete barrier between the two countries, said James Wong, a UW Chinese American student who recently visited Taiwan. ""Before I went to Taiwan,"" stated Wong, ""I couldn't understand why there was so much animosity -- because they're all Chinese. But the two can't live with the different ideologies. There's no way they're going to get together."" Wong recalled the anti-communist literature, lectures and programs he was required to attend as part of the tour visit.


Some people feel there is not much difference between Taiwan and China in areas of freedom and democracy. ""(Martial law in Taiwan) may have been necessary at some time in history, but now, it's overkill,"" stated Ted Choi, an American-born Chinese with the Chinese Community Service Organization.


Recognizing the shortcomings with the Nationalist government, Sandy Kan, a UW business student from Taiwan, stated, ""Taiwan has a problem in its degree of democracy [lack of free elections]."" But, she explained, ""The government should realize that people have different standards. When people are well-educated, they will know what democracy is. People are not that well-educated in developing countries as they are in the States.""


""Chinese Americans in this area are, of course, loyal to the United States,"" stated Monwai, president-elect of the Chong Wa Benevolent Association. ""We all enjoy more freedom and human rights in this country. But I do not approve of the Carter Administration selling out Taiwan to gain the relationship with China.""


May Wan feels China's political instability is questionable, citing the different ideological revolutions and leadership changes over the years. Therefore, the U.S.-China diplomatic relationship is still rather shaky, she said.


But without normalization, ""there's always the threat of war,"" said Wan. Both sides are suspicious, not knowing the other's thoughts, she said. ""It's better to open up communications,"" said Wan. David Lau said, ""If we had recognized China sooner I don't believe we'd have hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed in Korea or Vietnam.""


Not only will normalization assure global peace, it will bring social and economic gains to the United States and China.


""The improved relations with the People's Republic of China means opportunity for visiting more freely and openly,"" said Choi. ""This type of interchange will prove productive,"" he said. ""It will help in re-establishment of family relations.""


""The revelations in Teng's talks seem politically beneficial, not seemingly an expansionist threat,"" stated Choi. ""[His visit] neutralized my anxieties. He seems to really and truly want to build a great society.""


Foreign Trade Deficit


Economically, Lau said, ""The normalization is good for both countries and people."" As a capitalist country, the U.S. will have increased trade and economic benefit derived from the normalization, he said. ""I'm sure that China could help out part of our foreign trade deficit,"" said Lau.


A booming consumer trade with vast economic gains is not likely to occur immediately, said Monwai, who visited the People's Republic of China last November. ""Right now we have to wait and see,"" he said. ""As China is still a poor, developing country, she can't afford a large-scale consumer trade with foreign countries at this time. In the near future, our trade with China will concentrate in the area of heavy industries and the American advanced technologies. But who knows, five or ten years from now, our consumer trade with China could be a hot item.""


""Now the U.S. is willing -- out of political as much as economic motivation -- to acknowledge and deal with a billion people as political equals,"" stated Betty Fong, an American-born UW student. ""This is significant for Asian American minorities since it cannot be denied that international politics has always had an effect on minorities in this country, either positive or negative. I think that Asian Americans can consider the normalization as a positive step in both international politics and domestic race relations. But I think that regardless, whether the international political trend is favorable or not, Asian Americans as minorities in this country must continue to remain politically aware and committed.""

""In order to save the community, you have to tell its story to people outside the community,"" said Jean Coberly, Head of Seattle Public Library's History and Government Department.


Coberly heads an Asian Heritage Program series to be presented by the Seattle Public Library. She is looking for Asian community members to participate in its development.


The program series, made possible by a $308,475 grant recently received by the Public Library from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), is now in its early planning stage.


Coberly has already begun contacting members of the Asian community for the first segment of the Asian Heritage Program expected to begin at the end of September. She is interested in finding representatives of each ID ethnic group, including Korean and Vietnamese, to participate in the programs. There are small honorariums available to community members who present programs under the direction of Library staff.


The Asian Heritage Program Series, one of five programs funded by NEH on various historical periods and ethnic groups in Seattle, will be organized around several themes. These include: A Historic Overview; The Chinese in Seattle; The Japanese in Seattle; and The Filipino and Other 20th Century Immigrants in Seattle. According to Coberly, the Library is obligated by grant rules to use some of its own resources and materials in the programs, but the program content can be broadened by community input. Coberly, stressing the need for community involvement, said, ""It's not my role in life to tell ethnic groups that I know all about them.""


Free public exhibits, slide/tape shows, slide lectures, video/audio tapes and printed materials will be produced with the NEH funds, which will be available for the next two years.


One of Coberly's objectives is to present the programs in the historic location of the particular ethnic group and then in other parts of the City if enough interest is shown by the public. If meeting places are found in the International District, the Asian Heritage programs will first be presented in the District. Coberly would like to hold programs in buildings not normally open to the public or people outside the District. For example, she suggested holding a program on the history of the benevolent associations in an association's building.


In addition to finding members of various ethnic groups to participate, Coberly is also interested in obtaining materials for exhibits. Photographs from private collections and other materials for display will be solicited, and one of Coberly's staff members has expressed interest in taping interviews with community members to be used as narration for slide shows. Coberly can be reached in the History and Government Department of the Seattle Public Library at 625-4893.

To many irate drivers, finding the proverbial needle-in-a-haystack may seem more probable -- and less time-consuming -- than finding parking space in downtown Seattle.


One attractive alternative to the downtown scramble is the International District merchant-organized parking lots.


The lots are just a few blocks from downtown stores and businesses, and conveniently located on Metro's ""Magic Carpet"" (free ride zone). The District lots have another bonus -- prices are lower than downtown rates.


With the aid of grants, the International District Merchant Parking Association accommodates the vehicles of International District residents, as well as employees and visitors of downtown.


""We're attempting to develop a community-based parking operation,"" explained Glenn Chinn, association president and spokesperson. District residents, employees, and businesses always receive first priority on waiting lists, he said.


Association office manager Steve Goon added, ""Now that the kinks [in the operation] are almost all ironed out, we're getting the public to understand how things work down here.""


The organization is smaller scale than downtown lots, so personalized services may be rendered to a high percentage of patrons. Special needs, such as the accommodation of large restaurant banquets, are provided for, and individual monthly parking plans are designed to fit the customer.


The Merchants Parking Association was formed two years ago to counter anticipated encroachment by the Kingdome. While that issue continues to be significant, the focus has since shifted to parking demands created by rapid expansion of downtown.


Although new buildings continue to squeeze out parking lots, the association has been highly successful in providing parking at reasonable rates to all International District patrons and residents.


Financial self-sufficiency is a main objective of the Merchants Parking Association. The cooperation of community organizations such as the International District Economic Association (IDEA) and the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) has been essential in achieving this goal.

Well, we are now at halftime in the Great American political football game. The winners are regrouping for the next go around in November. The losers have been carried off the field. The public is about to endure another round of handshakes, luncheon meetings, doorbelling, media ads, bus signs, and fundraising.


The primary election is a true American phenomenon where individuals from varying walks of life with different political viewpoints come together for the noble purpose of getting your vote. The response this year was underwhelming. The farmland open space issue, for example, was not defeated by the number of people who voted, but by the number of people who didn't vote (it needed a certain percentage of the total eligible vote as well as a winning vote).


The Asian candidates fared well in the primary. For those of us who have been active in Asian community struggles, we always been on the outside of the ""establishment,"" the powers that be, which make the decisions. Ten years ago, it would have been almost impossible for an Asian to have been elected to office, unless they had a political viewpoint consistent with the times. Wing Luke had the appeal of a Kennedy Democrat while Liem Tuai rode on ""fiscal conservatism"" when it was popular in the late sixties.


Now, Asians are becoming part of or at least accepted by the establishment. All four Asian candidates who ran (Richard Ishikawa, Dolores Sibonga, Paul Horiuchi, and Lloyd Hara) had the endorsement of many established civic organizations including the Municipal League and the established media, including the Seattle Times, which have great influence on the minds of the voters. Ishikawa, who ran for and won a position on the King County Superior Court, received the endorsement of the legal establishment, the King County Bar Association. It usually means the ""kiss of death"" for anyone who doesn't get it.


The folks in the Asian community played a major role in at least one primary race, the campaign for the City Council between Dolores Sibonga, Bob Moffett, Nick Licata, and Walt Crowley.


Many in the community voted for Sibonga because she is minority, because she is Filipina, because she has a law degree, and because she served on the Council before. She was also the only woman in the race. Asian activists supported Licata because, among other things, he was in favor of rent control.


The International District Housing Alliance, one of the major housing activist groups in Renters and Owners Organized for Fairness (ROOF), is bringing the rent control issue before the public. The housing shortage in the District continues to worsen as the Milwaukee Hotel becomes the latest victim of owner neglect. As of now, there is little protection against spiraling rents for the residents of the International District.


Sibonga was singled out for her unwillingness to support rent control, although other candidates and all of the incumbents -- Norm Rice, Sam Smith, and Paul Kraabel -- share the same view of rent control. Rice, Smith, and Kraabel, however, did not face a candidate who was basically running on a rent control platform.


The rent control issues, however, did not prove to be a decisive factor in the primary contest. The candidates who supported rent control, Licata and Crowley, came in third and fourth. The candidates who didn't support rent control, Sibonga and Moffett, go into the final.


Aside from the rent control issue, the voters do have a clear choice between the ""liberal lawyer"" and the ""conservative cop."" Sibonga, in her brief stint on the Council, was a strong advocate of a stronger affirmative action plan for the City. Moffett, on the other hand, as president of the Seattle Police Guild, helped spearhead several reverse discrimination suits against the City. Sibonga is against the expansion of I-90, Moffett is for it.


The Licata supporters face the alternatives of voting for candidates who do not support rent control or sitting the final election out. Since Sibonga won the most votes in the primary and is expected to attract the voters who supported Crowley and Licata, those who sit the vote out indirectly help Moffett. Moffett would have the most to gain by a continuing rift between the Sibonga camp and rent control supporters.


The Asian community activists used to set up meetings with the white folks to present demands for better conditions in the community. Now we may have the opportunity to present demands to one of our own.

The proposed construction of the I-90 highway between Bellevue and Seattle may hamper the International District's efforts to revitalize as a residential and commercial community.


The controversial I-90 project has been the target of intense debate and scrutiny since it was announced in 1957. Key issues in the I-90 debate are: urban development, land use, environmental impacts, and the project's costs and benefits. For the International District, a number of uncertainties need to be clarified before a final impact assessment can be provided.


At present, U.S. District Court Judge Gordon Thompson is examining the state and federal request to lift a 1972 injunction which halted the I-90 construction. The injunction had been issued because the state's environmental impact statement was inadequate. Judge Thompson, who received testimony last month, is expected to make a ruling in late August. If the judge's ruling upholds the injunction, I-90, as presently planned, will most likely not be built. Though the state will probably appeal the decision, rapidly rising costs amounting to roughly 293,000 dollars a day over the last three years, may discourage continuation of the project if the decision is overturned.


However, if the injunction is lifted, highway construction could begin again as early as summer, 1980.


The state's current I-90 plan calls for construction of an eight-lane structure. Known as the 3-2T-3 configuration, it would have three lanes running both eastbound and westbound, with two additional lanes reserved for mass transit, car pools and Mercer Island residents. The present bridge between Seattle and Mercer Island would be converted into three lanes, and a new bridge parallel to the existing span would comprise the other five lanes.


The 6.9 mile highway is presently estimated to cost over one billion dollars. At more than 122 million dollars per mile, and with costs rising at the dramatic rate of approximately 293,000 dollars a day, it is questionable whether the project is worth the cost.


Last year, Seattle Mayor Charles Royer offered a smaller 2-2T-2 configuration, arguing that transit and safety needs, two of the primary considerations for I-90 completion, could be met in a less costly manner. However, the Mayor's proposal was greeted with less than a lukewarm response from the state Department of Transportation, and the cities of Mercer Island and Bellevue. At present, the Mayor's office is the only government entity which supports the 2-2T-2 alternative.


Assuming I-90 is completed, its impact on the International District will be determined, in part, by whether the Connecticut Street Interchange and direct bus transit access are built. If these options are not incorporated into the project's design, automobile and bus volume on Dearborn are likely to increase drastically. According to Richard Yukubousky, Transportation Planner, Office of Policy Planning, ""This will increase the severity of impact on the International District."" If the Connecticut Street Interchange and direct transit access are built, the environmental impact could diminish; however, spillover effects such as higher land values may occur. Even if the Connecticut Street Interchange is constructed, traffic on Dearborn may still increase dramatically. If overcrowding occurs on the Connecticut Street Interchange, commuters may prefer to use Dearborn to save time.


Metro's unpublished I-90 Transit Access Draft Study, dated June 1, 1979, describes the probable impact of I-90 alternatives on the International District: ""With increasing transit accessibility from the Eastside, the International District would be more likely to attain their goal of commercial and office buildings. The goal of developing housing, on the other hand, might be adversely affected because of increasing land values ... On Dearborn Street, the transit traffic will have increased and areas adjacent to Dearborn Street may not be suitable for residential development due to noise and exhaust fumes from bus traffic.""


The possible negative impact of higher transit volume on housing is contrary to the Neighborhood Strategy Area (NSA) Program's goal of ""restablishing the District as a stable downtown residential/commercial community."" The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development recently approved a proposal to establish a NSA program in the International District.


Downzoning of the District's manufacturing zone, between Lane and Dearborn Streets, will be considered by the Environmental Management Division, Department of Community Development, in the near future.


According to Al Kurimura, International District Project Manager, to make the area presently zoned for manufacturing more conducive to housing, ""there is a need to both rezone and encourage amenities, such as the mini-park, which are compatible with a residential population. At the same time, to minimize negative impacts on the area, such as heavy traffic, is also important. Having I-90 or more cars end up at Dearborn just would not help.""


The high demand for land adjacent to the District's western periphery, namely the Union Street Station site and the area south of the Kingdome, has significance for future development in the District. To deal with growing transit needs and downtown traffic congestion, Metro is considering development of a bus transfer terminal in that vicinity of the District. If Metro's bus transfer facility is constructed, buses using I-90 would stop at the terminal and transfer commuters immediately onto a bus which would transport passengers downtown or back across Lake Washington. In addition, buses going to and coming from other destinations would also use the facility.


The coincidental construction of possibly I-90 and Metro's bus transfer terminal -- along with the completed Kingdome and I-5 projects in or near the International District -- is no accident. The District's proximity to the Central Business District (CBD) means land demand has increased with greater intensity as the CBD and transit routes to serve the CBD expand. This trend is not likely to change in the near future.

IDEC wishes to thank all those concerned enough to call in incidents. Here are a few helpful reminders about what we need to know when you call: your address and intersection; what type of help is needed; your phone number; how long ago it happened.


A person was found in the Bush Hotel hallway with cuts. Upon the arrival of medics, the person went back into his room where the cut had occurred. The room was splattered with blood. Police arrived and started to investigate the case. Medics transported the person to Harborview Medical Center (HMC).


There was an arson fire at the Alps Hotel. Fire marshals are looking into the case. Also at the Alps, IDEC medics found a man who had apparently slashed both his arms with a small razor. A large amount of blood was lost. The man apparently slashes his arms to solve some personal problems. He was sent to HMC in serious condition.


Police were busy responding to broken windows, including the front doors of the Alps Hotel and the Hong Kong Restaurant and window of International Cab. Police are looking into the incidents. Police also responded to a report of a man with a gun at the Sun Ya Cafe. Police arrived and got the situation under control. There were no injuries. Another incident at the China Gate Restaurant had the police busy on another disturbance involving a group of youths.


And on a sad note, IDEC medics found an elderly man who had sat in a chair in the lobby of a local hotel for five days and nights not knowing how to ask for proper help. He was unable to walk or move without help. Medics were saddened that a person had to wait for 120 hours before help was called. If you have an emergency, call us at 623-3321 or call 911.


IDEC received a phone call about a small girl who had been hit by a car near 10th and Jackson. The child had been picked up and taken into a nearby office. Medics found the child with a broken leg and several cuts. The child was sent to HMC. IDEC and the ID Health Center were requested by the Fire Department medics to follow up on the case. Medics remind people never to move a person who has been injured unless they are in extreme danger. Moving a person can only aggravate an injury if done without the proper equipment.

In the last issue of The Examiner, a multi-family housing strategy was discussed. Owners of presently vacant hotels would have the confidence to re-invest in their properties, it was suggested, once a couple of rehabilitation projects prove successful.


What kind of strategy will be needed to encourage new residential construction? And what kind of strategy is needed to develop housing in the District without displacing current residents?


Residential Construction


Unlike many other areas of Seattle, the International District has some vacant land, which makes it easier to construct new housing. On the north side of Jackson Street, particularly Main and Washington Streets, there are vacant lots particularly suited for new residential construction. This area offers a view of the Sound and is in proximity to the District's retail core and downtown.


Such projects, however, could only be built at a great loss because of the land values and hilly terrain. Because of the high development cost, developers would probably be most interested in constructing condominiums rather than single-family houses or apartments on the sites. Condominium sales generate higher profits at a faster return rate than either rentals or sale of homes.


The possibility of new market-rate housing construction, however, should not be eliminated. There are a number of professionals, including many middle-income Asians, who would find rental housing in the District very desirable. Rents would have to be about $300 for one-bedroom rentals and perhaps as high as $400 for two-bedroom rentals.


In any case, there is little chance that only low-income housing, other than the two current projects. Imperial House and International House, will be built in the District in the future. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will probably not support any more low-cost housing beyond the 225 units it will commit to the District through its Neighborhood Strategy Area Program. And, without HUD's support, the chances are very low that new low-cost rental units will be constructed.


More important, the development of market rate units is needed to offset the expected development of additional low-income housing in the District.


The strategy for new residential construction should, then, focus primarily on generating market-rate housing. To help realize that housing, community groups could market the District to inform developers of the potential return from marketrate residential development. To supplement these efforts, the Special Review District Board could provide zoning incentives such as a density bonus. The City could assist market-rate housing development by the placement of streets, alleys, lights, trees and other land improvements, and by helping developers get their building permits.


Anti-Displacement Strategy


All the displacement in the District has resulted from dis-investment; buildings have closed either because they failed to meet the housing codes or because they are unprofitable.


This is somewhat different from displacement in other neighborhoods. There, displacement results primarily from reinvestment -- young professionals buying up homes, apartments being converted to condominiums, replacement of older homes with apartments, and renovation of apartments.


The District can learn from what is happening in other neighborhoods. It is possible to re-vitalize the District with either little or no residential displacement. To accomplish this, it is important to control development, for example, through land use regulations and public improvement projects, and, of course, to have accessible resources.


This housing strategy should:


Preserve the present supply of low-cost housing. Every effort should be made to work with the Building Department to prevent further hotel closures. Efforts should be made to encourage hotel owners to participate in the Neighborhood Strategy Area Program. Hotel owners should contact the International District Manager's office or the Office of Housing, both within the City's Department of Community Development, to get technical assistance. Owners might also consider re-investing in their retail spaces at increased rent, thereby keeping the rents in the rest of the hotel low. The Special Review Board might consider some guidelines to prevent unwarranted residential demolition.


Increase the supply of low-cost housing. Additional low-cost housing must be developed before market-rate housing and other commercial development rapidly takes hold in the District. Hopefully, the City will provide all the resources needed to make the Neighborhood Strategy Area Program a success.


The Special Review Board might also consider a regulation requiring all new residential construction of five or more units to have 15 per cent of those units rent at low-cost or be available as subsidized housing.


Provide relocation services. Where displacement occurs, a mechanism should be implemented like the one outlined in the Neighborhood Strategy Area Program, to help residents relocate within a district. The relocation service would move residents into newly-renovated housing units or pay them a fee, which residents could use to relocate.

Prompted by the resignation of division director Larry Flores, Asian division counselors have sounded off on what they call a lack of support in the University of Washington's Office of Minority Affairs (OMA).


Flores resigned his position June 15 after serving as director for three years. He said ""subtle changes over the past year"" under Dr. Herman Lujan, Vice President for Minority Affairs, caused him to leave. Following recommendations from a search committee, Lujan will appoint a new director within a few weeks.


The Asian division is one of five components in the Equal Opportunity Program (EOP) administered by the OMA The other four divisions serve blacks, Chicanos, American Indians, and economically disadvantaged (white) students. This fall, about 3,000 persons are registered as EOP students.


The EOP program gives minority and economically disadvantaged students the chance to enter and graduate from the University, and supplies them with counseling and study skills and instructional training if needed.


Inadequate Staffing


The major complaint from Flores and Asian division counselors is inadequate staff help. With 585 incoming freshmen this year, the staff must advise nearly 60 per cent of all the first-year EOP students, although they make up only 4 out of 14 total counselors. Prior to the start of the Academic Advising Unit, which was designed to alleviate workload, there were about 1400 total students in the Asian division. That compares to about 700 in the black component last year, with the same number of staffing.


The students will suffer from the staff problem, said acting director Vic Pineda. Pineda, who like Flores has been with the division since 1972, cited preregistration workshops, graduate receptions, and a special admissions policy for non-resident Indochinese refugees as activities being cut out. Also, students this year will have to wait longer for direct counseling.


According to Asian division counselors, their concerns on the matter have been made known to Lujan.


""Initially, we've made requests for more help and they say they know about our problem, but what are they doing?"" asked Edmon Lee, a counselor for four years.


""If we can't get things done in-house it only makes sense to publicize the problem and let the community know,"" he continued.


No Money


Lujan acknowledges the requests for additional staffing, but claims that with a carry-forward budget in the OMA, there is no money for help.


""I don't have any new money lying around or any new positions lying around that I can allocate,"" said Lujan, who has been vice president since spring, 1978.


Because of the lack of funds, Lujan said he suggested to the division the use of graduate students as temporary help and he rewarded senior division counselors for their work.


In addition, Lujan mentioned he is in the process of acquiring specialized grant money for the office.


""The Asian division has never, in the recent past, gone out and gotten any grant funds that are available,"" said Lujan. ""It would seem to me that some initiative from the division would be helpful in addressing the work-load problem.""


Nori Mihara, formerly the director of mathematics instruction at the tutorial center, was appointed by Lujan early this year as an executive staff assistant. As the individual in charge of all the student divisions, he sees the problem of understaffing as universal.


""The black division, Chicano division, Indian division, white division, Asian division, instructional center -- they all are inadequately staff,"" said Mihara.


""But I have yet to hear of a program that says, 'Yeah, we have adequate staffing.'""


At the start of 1979, Lujan devised the Academic Advising Unit (AAU) to reduce the student overflow in the divisions and to provide more specialized academic counseling. Beginning autumn, 1979, all students with 45 credits (one full year of classes) and who are recommended for transfer by a division counselor are moved into the AAU. There, they receive academic counseling by a multi-ethnic staff who are experts in any particular field.


""The Academic Advising Unit was designed to provide students with good academic answers,"" explained Lujan. ""The students need to talk to people with in-depth knowledge of a given field.""


The counselors assigned to transfer the students into the AAU do not feel, however, that the transition has been smooth or that it would relieve their work-load as much as one would expect.


""The students still come back,"" said acting director Pineda. ""We still see students for reasons besides academics.""


""Particularly with the Asian students, we don't get students who come in and say they've got a head problem -- they come in and talk about their classes or whatever,"" recalled Edmon Lee.


""And then you get deep down into it and it's personal. But what are they going to say over in the AAU, that they can't handle that?""


Lee also said many students were confused by the change-over to the AAU and it was difficult for counselors to tell students they recruited to go somewhere else.


Lujan counters his main concern is students in their first two years, and he wants the divisions to serve their needs first.


""I have made the deliberate policy decision, and I'll take the flak from any community group, that that's my priority group -- those in-coming people,"" responded Lujan.


""The issue is not that we can separate academic from personal problems,"" he continued. ""The issue is if a student has an academic question, where is the best place to get an academic answer?""


Flores and the division counselors are also disturbed by what they see as ""political decisions"" in promotional and hiring practices within the OMA. They believe certain divisions are getting more visibility in higher positions, at the expense of other divisions.


""I guess it hit me first with the hassle over the appointment of the second director of the AAU,"" said Flores. ""I expected Lujan to share each of his decisions with all the division directors before it was done, but I saw some decisions made without any input,"" he recounted.


Mary Bogan was appointed by Lujan as the initial AAU director, but resigned after one month. Before a formal job announcement appeared, Elaine Miller, acting director of the black division, was selected as her successor.


""With any job opening, you should open it up in-house and let everybody have a chance,"" said Edmon Lee. ""Initially, Lujan had just appointed someone to the position.""


""Whether anyone is interested or not, it makes you wonder what kind of promotional procedures are there to give fair and adequate consideration to all interested staff,"" he continued.


Lujan responds that the appointment was made during the office reorganization, and therefore does not follow regular job replacement guidelines.


""During reorganization, I have the option as director, of shifting people's responsibilities and the selection of Elaine Miller took place under this option,"" explained Lujan.


""Therefore, the search is less extensive, there is far less advertising; it's a reassignment of internal duties.""


Another recent concern of the counselors is the appointment of a new recruitment coordinator in July. Without a formal job announcement, Carl Miller, a counselor in the black division, was chosen, despite a memo of July 6 that calls specifically for announcement procedures on new openings.


""This is a temporary assignment and with a temporary assignment you don't have to advertise,"" said Lujan. ""The University allows us to give someone an additional duty if that duty is important and to give that person a modest and temporary increase in salary.""


It has been pointed out that other counselors have more recruiting experience than the recent appointee. Lujan replied: ""Some experience in this case was one thing, but there were several other things needed too.""


""We needed to have an individual who had some experience in those areas where our recruitment was low,"" he said. ""The areas of falling enrollment since 1974 are the black and Chicano enrollment.""


Asian division counselors believe they are being overlooked for in-house promotions. They feel they are stuck with ""dead-end jobs,"" as fourth-year counselor Steve Aspiras put it.


""You just start to feel pretty low when all these people are going past you in terms of better-paying jobs and more responsibility and you're more or less in the starting gate,"" said Aspiras.


The division counselors want the new director to be a strong leader with close communityties, and Vice President Lujan agrees.


""I think I have established some reasonable relations with parts of our minority community in Seattle,"" he said. ""I would hope that whoever is picked, if he didn't have the ties already, could establish them in a relatively short period of time and with some ease.""


According to the Asian division counselors, the students will suffer unless they speak out on specific problems which affect them.


""The students have to realize they're not getting the services they should get,"" said Lee. ""It's showing now, a lot of people have to wait a long time for counseling.""


""If the students bring about their concern, we may get more support,"" said Adrienne Chan, a counselor since 1973. ""But that might be the only way; we've gone through our channels.""


All of the counselors have considered leaving the division since Flores resigned, but they say it is the students who keep them there.


""It's hard to leave,"" said Aspiras. ""You look around and see a lot of students and you hate to leave them hanging.""


""You know, before you were able to name all the students by their faces,"" he continued. ""But now, because of their numbers, it's pretty hard to remember all of their names. It means a lot to them.""

On the 30th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China, October 1, 32 delegates from the National Association of Chinese Americans (NACA) made a ten-day official trip to Beijing, China. Prof. P. T. Ho, NACA vice president, led the delegation. The delegates hoped to establish and enhance the normalization of relations between China and the United States.


The delegates left Hong Kong on September 23, arriving in Kwang Chow after a five-hour train ride. They then flew to Beijing. The delegates stayed in Beijing Hotel, in the heart of the city, next to the main shopping area -- Wang Fujing Street. This is Beijing's most exquisite and expensive hotel, with more than 900 rooms. A few blocks from the hotel are the Forbidden City (Palace Museum) and the Tien An Men Square.


The delegates spent the first day in Beijing visiting Palace Museum, built in the 15th Century (1406-1420). It was the imperial palace of the Ming Dynasty. Before the 1911 Revolution, the palace was heavily guarded. The local people were not allowed to enter and enjoy the Palace's beauty and magnificence. Hence, it was dubbed ""The Forbidden City."" It has over 9,000 rooms. The delegates admired the grandeur of the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the ingenuity of the ancient Chinese architects who had constructed watch towers with intricate carving, design and color. Smoke -- curling up in the air from the incense burners in the shape of tortoise, storks and peaches (the symbols of longevity) on the white marble terrace -- blended harmoniously with the music from the hall gallery.


The following day the delegates visited Tien Tan park (The Temple of Heaven). It is covered with ancient pines and green cypresses, many of which are over 500 years old. The Park's main buildings are a group of temples noted for their intricate layout, glamorous color, and unique structure. A fascinating feature in the Temple of Heaven is the sound effect produced by the Imperial Heavenly Vault's surrounding wall and the Circular Mound Altar's center stone. Two people, each standing behind opposing side chambers, and speaking softly to the walls, can hear each other. The delegates made ""telephone calls"" through the wall and enjoyed communicating in this fashion.


The delegates admired the grandeur of the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the ingenuity of the ancient Chinese architects who had constructed watch towers with intricate carving, design and color.


The delegates also visited a local hospital (Tsien Siew Tan). The Chinese doctors demonstrated incredible feats of orthopedic surgery. A young man's cancerous leg was cut off. He was then connected with a swollen leg of a person who was supposed to be dead. Acupuncture treatment of various diseases also was exhibited and the principles of application were discussed among the physicians. The doctors' surgical skills were highly impressive, although there was a shortage of medical equipment.


By special arrangement, the delegates met with Vice Premier Fang Yi, the Minister for Science and Technology, at the People's Great Hall of Meeting on September 27. Several delegates expressed the desire to contribute money and manpower to help fulfill the dream of modernizing China by the end of the 20th Century. The Vice Premier remarked, ""I appreciate your assistance and cooperation in developing China. However, we Chinese do not accept foreign aid as such but would accept loan with interest payable in five to ten years. We need foreign investors with capital to bring in new ideas and technological skill into the country. Entrepreneurs are welcomed to investigate the prospect of starting factories and introducing new technical know-how. The people of China are most willing to learn to reach the target of improving the living conditions of the people.""


The State reception marking the 30th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China was held September 29 at the People's Great Hall of Meeting. Thousands of Overseas Chinese attended the joyous celebration. Liao Chengzhi, Head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council, pointed out that ""after the founding of the Communist Party in China, the Chinese people led by the Party -- by the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and his close comrades-in-arms, Comrades Zhou Enlai and Zhu De and other proletarian revolutionaries, waged a self-reliant struggle for 28 years which involved a lot of bloodshed and sacrifice and finally overthrew imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism (the three scourges that weighed like mountains on the backs of the people) and founded the People's Republic of China, thus ushering in a new era in China. For 30 years since the founding of New China our country has achieved undeniable great successes in socialistic revolution and socialistic construction and laid the preliminary foundation for a socialist economy.""


On the eve of National Day (October 1), the delegates visited the Great Wall of China, a two-hour train trip from Peking. The famous Great Wall was built during the Warring States Period (476-221 BC). It was a military project constructed by various small kingdoms to hold back nomadic tribes coming from the north and to protect against each other. When the wall was rebuilt in the Ming Dynasty, a lot of bricks and stones were used and some of the slabs were as long as two meters, weighing one ton. Considering the poor conditions of the time, one can imagine how extremely difficult the project must have been. Because of the high quality of its construction, most of the Great Wall built under Ming still stands intact. The Great Wall played a significant role in protecting the economic and cultural development of China's Central Plain.

The State Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) is working hard to overcome a mistrust many Asian Americans have of its bureaucracy, according to Bob Absolor, King County DVR counselor.


This ""mistrust"" is often compounded by an image of DVR as a ""male-oriented, all-white organization,"" said Absolor.


Absolor said DVR is attempting to hire people that can relate to the Asian community. He points out that 12 out of 42 counselors serving King County DVR programs are, like himself, minorities.


Absolor, in conjunction with Vernon Matsuo Oato, a DVR Affirmative Action Officer, has initiated an outreach program to inform the King County Asian community of Vocational Rehabilitation services.


Absolor said that, of the estimated 42,000 Asians in King County, as many as five percent could be eligible for DVR services.


Vocational Rehabilitation offers services to individuals who have a physical or mental disability which constitutes a substantial handicap to employment. Services include vocational counseling, job training, and job placement. Funding is also available for tuition, books, equipment and transportation, and living allowances.


Absolor said additional reasons for limited Asian participation in vocational rehabilitation programs are prior funding constraints and a host of new rehabilitation programs. ""Additionally, many Asians display a fierce pride that manifests itself in a tendency to take care of their own people,"" he said.


Absolor said he hopes the Asian community will help DVR better serve Asian clients by responding to outreach efforts. ""We have a proven record of success,"" he said. ""The division expects to successfully rehabilitate more than 1,300 clients in King County this year.""


Counselors respond to client needs by compiling vocational assessments that pinpoint a person's strengths and weaknesses. The result is an individualized rehabilitation plan which helps each client prepare for work. These preliminary services may also include an evaluation of a person's work potential in a real work situation at a rehabilitation center or sheltered workshop.


""Help can include physical and mental aids such as artificial limbs, medication and psychotherapy,"" said Absolor. ""Our goal is to assist a person into gainful employment and independence.""

Once upon a time there was a professor of English whose ancestors came from Japan. Growing up in Canada, he made an extensive study of the English language. His work attracted the admiration of many in his field. He gained national recognition as an expert in linguistics.


He believed himself a liberal and championed civil rights causes, advocating the concern that racial minorities in this country were badly mistreated. His concern reflected the prevailing liberalism on those college campus days of the sixties. He had a way with words, becoming known to his students as a very ""hip"" professor. Yet, his name was not very well known. His name was frequently mistaken for an actor who portrayed a prisoner of war camp commander in the ""Bridge on the River Kwai.""


Through the sixties, he quietly went on attending to his business of teaching. And while he was teaching English classes at the University of Chicago, John F. Kennedy was sending military advisers into a distant Southeast Asian country.


As the skirmish in Southeast Asia turned into a battle and a battle turned into a war, young Americans began opposing United States military involvement there. The protest turned into an anti-war movement which became very conspicuous on college campuses throughout America.


As the anti-war movement grew, college administrators became irritated at the growing number of protests and anti-war demonstrations on campus. Students took over many university campuses across the nation to show the world that they believed the war in Southeast Asia was wrong.


At one university, San Francisco State, the college president could not cope with anti-war activity and resigned. The Board of Regents desperately sought someone to take the position over, turning to an English professor who was very popular with his students.


Announcing his sympathy with the anti-war movement, the professor nonetheless said that his job was to continue educating the students and that he would not let anything interfere with that. And the legend of S.I. Hayakawa was born.


Hayakawa kept the university open and became a darling of the media. He was a liberal professor, but was soon to be embraced by conservative groups and politicians because he had stood up to ""liberal bleeding hearts."" His tam o'shanter became a symbol for pro-war, anti-youth, law and order conservatives. The media made him out to be a hero, a symbol for the rednecks. The conservatives liked what he did and soon Hayakawa embarked on a widespread speaking tour where he would speak to little old ladies waving American flags and folks who were horrified about the declining morals in our schools. The silent majority had spoken and he was their man.


For many years, he had struggled in relative obscurity as a liberal English professor. But all of a sudden, he was famous, attracting fortune and fame as a conservative, moving his political views in a complete flip-flop. Minorities being mistreated, maybe so, but there's no money in that.


When the United States pulled out of Southeast Asia, the anti-war movement fizzled out and the campus scene reverted to beer busts and looking out for number one. The old college professor became an antiquated relic of the past. But not for long.


Guess who would announce for the Democratic Party California U.S. Senate seat? Tom Hayden, a ""radical,"" one of the infamous ""Chicago Seven,"" the husband of the dreaded Jane Fonda, announced his intention to run for the Senate seat, having become respectable in his three-piece suit. What would be more appropriate for the Republicans than to oppose Hayden, a symbol of hippies and the anti-war movement, with the old college professor? There was just one problem -- Hayakawa was a registered Democrat, a political affiliation left over from his nonproductive (non-money-making) days as a liberal.


But that was a minor obstacle -- Hayakawa had no future as a Democrat and easily switched the tassels on his tam o'shanter from the left to the right and became a diehard Republican. Once again, his name was ""news."" He was a novice politician, he really didn't have a great grasp of the issues, but he was definitely an attractive, colorful figure for the media to cover.


In the primary, John Tunney defeated Hayden. So in the election, Hayakawa ran against Tunney, a liberal Democrat. Hayakawa ran on a platform of less government spending and witty sayings. He vowed to clean up Congress with a shovel. In a year when traditional politicians had trouble, Tunney could not match Hayakawa word for word. Non-traditional ""anti-politicians"" were being elected, such as Dixy Lee Ray and the old college professor.


Hayakawa became the junior senator from California in the U.S. Congress and quickly established a reputation for voting conservative, acting conservative, and speaking conservative. But just as quickly he also developed the habit of sleeping in Congressional sessions when subjects didn't interest him. And as the daily routine of Congress wore on, Hayakawa faded into the woodwork.


Now and then Hayakawa's name would pop up again. Stevie Wonder included Hayakawa's name in a song entitled ""Black Man,"" which told of accomplishments made by both white and minority people in this country (the song is on the album ""Songs in the Key of Life""). Hayakawa is included -- along with Harriet Tubman, Cesar Chavez, and Abraham Lincoln -- for his achievements in linguistics.


Recently, Hayakawa has been back in the spotlight. The former civil rights advocate is on record to say that being sent to concentration camps was good for the Japanese Americans during World War II. After all, he said, the Japanese did bomb Pearl Harbor.


Hayakawa missed out on the allegedly good experience that he talks about because he was going to school in the Midwest during the war. Of course, he could have insisted on being sent to camps with the other Japanese and have his property confiscated, but how was he to know at the time that it was going to be such a good thing.


The Japanese Americans of this country, who were shipped out and herded into the camps, sacrificed sons who volunteered to fight in World War II, lost property, and were denied freedom, guilty by reason of race. The government has never said that the actions taken were wrong. The movement for redress has come forth seeking justice for the Issei and Nisei who were forced into exile during World War II. Hayakawa says redress is an attempt by young Japanese to ""make Whitey feel guilty."" Hayakawa, who lost neither his freedom nor his property but claims to speak for a majority of Japanese Americans, has threatened to prevent any attempt to make redress a reality.


Proving that his insensitivity is not reserved for Japanese Americans, the old college professor, in discussing the gas shortage, said that the poor should not get gas because they are unemployed and have nowhere to go. Such a statement might come out of the mouth of Archie Bunker. The difference, however, is that while All in the Family is a comedy show, Hayakawa is a political joke.

The First Annual Invitational Asian Art Exhibit sponsored by the Wing Luke Museum and the Seattle Arts Commission received a ""very good response from the public,"" according to Priscilla Chong, temporary director of the Museum.


More than 30 artists and photographers from Seattle and a handful of visiting artists displayed their work at the Wing Luke exhibit June 2 to 30. The 66 art pieces included: oil paintings, pottery, watercolors, photography, block prints, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture.


The five-member panel of jurors -- one painter, three college art professors, a fine arts professor, and a photographer -- meted out the awards.


Victor Gardaya's Roy Street Overpass captured first place for photography. Last year, Gardaya was commissioned by the Wing Luke Museum to photograph Seattle. Roy Street Overpass, a black-and-white photograph, was one product of his night prowlings through the City.


The Overpass is seen from below. A few tiny beads of light exquisitely define the smooth arc of the railing, like dew on a spider's web. A traffic sign above bears a lone arrow, pointing off into space.


It is the type of photograph intellectuals love to discuss and try to decode. But Gardaya insists that his photograph was uncontrived. During his commission, he sometimes roamed out-of-the-way corners of the City at two or three in the morning with his camera. One night, looking up, he saw the unusual lighting of the bridge and snapped the prize-winning photo.


New York-born Gardaya, who has practiced fine art photography for seven years, cites two major influences. One is the work of Andre Kertesz, a Hungarian photographer best known for his work in Paris in the Thirties.


The other is the concept of Minimalism -- especially as displayed in traditional Japanese art. Minimalism is reduction of art to its purist form, the expression of ideas in as few strokes as possible.


Every painting rises from the unconscious. It's like a melting together . . . a coming out of experiences from the past.


With these words, Yoshiko Sakurai described her massive work, Afternoon Pond, which won second place for watercolors.


Afternoon Pond contains large, free-floating shapes reminiscent of molten rainbows, or the spinning colors of a soap bubble. The abstract shapes are laid upon a stark white background.


Watercolors are Sakurai's favorite medium. ""They're more natural,"" she says. Sakurai, who received Bachelor of Arts degrees in both fine arts and painting at the University of Washington, will continue her graduate studies at Columbia University in New York this fall.


Cheryll Leo-Gwin's mixed media sculpture, Working Lady, was one of the most intriguing of the Wing Luke art pieces, something akin to Pop-Art. It placed third among sculptures.


A bust of the Queen of Spades is set on a mirrored base, producing, in its entirety, a perfect replica of a playing card.


The Queen's face of grey procelain appears to have been cast over a real woman's face. The Queen's eyes are tranquilly closed and she has a mysterious Mona Lisa smile. These present a strange contrast to the gaudily-colored, chaotic surrounding design. The white background of the card is either plastic or fiberglass, but the Queen's rich costome is set in a type of enamel cloissone.


Cut into the Working Lady's chest is a heart. The inset contains many objects: thimble, needle and thread, a Safe Worker's medal, some type of vegetable-growing permit. What does the Working Lady or Queen dream of? What does the domestic soul feel amid chaotic surroundings?


Leo-Gwin is an accomplished artist who received her Bachelor of Arts and Master's degrees from the University of Washington. She has taught metalsmithing and jewelry workshops at North Seattle and Highline Community Colleges, and worked under a Ford Foundation grant in 1977.


All the Wing Luke Displays were noteworthy, and some pieces of art had unique stories behind them. For example, Autumn Insect, an exquisite Chinese watercolor by visiting artist Chun-O Lu, seems even more poignantly beautiful when one learns the artist is a deaf mute.


The Wing Luke exhibit was a showcase for some of the finest Asian American artists. Due to the high level of public interest in the exhibit. The Wing Luke Museum hopes to make the Asian American art exhibit a regular event in Seattle.

Staff members frustrated with changes in the University of Washington's Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) are resigning in protest. The latest to resign is Steve Aspiras a counselor in the Asian Students Division, one of five ethnic divisions in EOP.


The other divisions serve Blacks, Chicanos, American Indians and economically disadvantaged (white) students. EOP is administered by the University's Office of Minority Affairs under Vice President Dr. Herman Lujan.


Aspiras is about 16th or 17th to resign since Luhan took office a year and a half ago, according to Asian Division staff. The most recent resignations in the past month include: Josephine Arnold, counselor with the Indian Division, Dawn Blanch, counselor in the economically disadvantaged division and Bea Kiyohara, Health Science Advisor in EOP's Academic Advising Unit.


Lujan acknowledged seeing resignation letters from Kiyohara and Blanch, but said, ""I don't see it as a problem within EOP. The staff turnover is usually high at this time of the year.""


EOP's new admission policy is the latest complaint by staff members. Lujan says changes in the admissions policy are a result of the Bakke decision.


The admissions policy is effective Autumn, 1980 and the admissions criteria will be based on: UW application, two letters of recommendation, an interview process, high school transcript and grade point average, four pages of supplemental application and standardized test results such as the Washington pre-college test or the SAT.


""The trend of education is going more toward quality education that EOP should not be in,"" Kiyohara said. ""Following suit would end with creaming the top of the minority pool. Where does the bottom minorities go?"" she asked.


Aspiras at press time had not submitted a formal resignation, but said ""Lujan, knows about it."" Aspiras says he probably will be out by the end of the month. ""It's getting too crazy"" at EOP, he said. He complains of lack of staff as a special problem of the Asian division. ""There's not enough staff to handle all the students,"" he said. In the Asian Division alone, there are presently 1600 students and only four staff members to counsel them, according to both Aspiras and Vic Pineda, acting director of the Asian Division. The 1600 Asian EOP students, they said, are 51 percent of the total number of students in EOP.


Under the new admissions policy, the staff is expected to take on the added burden of recruiting and interviewing new students while at the same time take care of the present student population, according to Pineda. ""Other things will suffer,"" he said.


""Basically, Asians are getting shafted,"" Aspiras said. He said the large number of Asian EOP students has helped Lujan get money for the program because program funding is based on head counts. However, Aspiras continued, ""We're (Asian Division) getting shortchanged"" in lack of staffing and promotional opportunities.


Lujan said he is preparing the budget and could not say whether the Asian Division needed more counselors at present. ""I'm in the middle of assessing whether or not the current staff can handle"" the number of students, he said. ""We're finally getting the data"" of students enrolled for fall, 1979 and last year to determine what the needs are, he said. Lujan also said that, after the assessment, the decision to hire more staff would depend on the budget.


""I've got a carry-forward budget,"" he said, which he describes as working under the same budget ""as two years ago with a modest increase."" Lujan said more staffing would depend on whether he can get money from other resources. ""I will try to address the need of every student,"" he said.


Kiyohara and Aspiras, however, contradict Lujan's claim of a limited budget. They've complained about Lujan's intent to hire a new assistant vice president. Kiyohara said in her letter of resignation, ""I cannot be convinced that three assistant vice presidents at $30,000 plus"" would help provide direct service to students.

On February 9, Federal Judge Donald Voorhees granted a motion by several community organizations and civil rights groups to intervene as plaintiffs in the Seattle School District lawsuit against the State of Washington.


The School District had filed suit against the State in November to prevent enforcement of Initiative 350, a law which would prevent the Seattle Public Schools from carrying out their desegregation plans. The initiative, passed by the voters in November, prohibits a school district from assigning students to schools other than the closest or next closest neighborhood schools.


Judge Voorhees also granted a temporary restraining order preventing the State from enforcing Initiative 350 for the time being.


The organizations which joined the suit are: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); the Church Council of Greater Seattle; the Loren Miller Bar Association, a black lawyers' group; the Seattle Urban League; the Seattle Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); the American Friends Service Committee, and the Seattle Chapter of the American Jewish Council.


Ann Siqueland, of the Church Council, said the intervention of these groups stems from a lawsuit almost filed in 1977. At that time, the Seattle School District was threatened with a lawsuit by the ACLU, the Church Council, the NAACP, and the Asian American Educators Association for failing to implement desegregation plans. In response, the School District committed itself to full desegregation by the fall of 1980 and directed the Superintendent to develop a two year plan to accomplish it. On this commitment, the groups dropped their lawsuit.


When Initiative 350 passed in November, the School District was placed in a Catch-22 situation. The implementation of Initiative 350 restrictions on student assignment would mean the Seattle School District's desegregation plan was against the law. But if the School District did not follow through on their desegregation efforts, it might be in violation of laws against the racial segregation of the schools.


In November, the Seattle School District, along with the Tacoma and Pasco School Districts, filed suit in federal court against the State of Washington to prevent the enforcement of Initiative 350 on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional -- it would force the schools to segregate the schools in violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.


When the School District filed the lawsuit, groups active in the desegregation effort met to decide whether they should participate in the legal action. The NAACP, the Church Council, and the ACLU -- which would have brought the lawsuit in 1977 if the School District had not desegregated its schools -- are intervening plaintiffs supporting the School District in the present lawsuit.


The Asian American Educators Association the other group active in the 1977 action againt the School District, is not participating. Gary Higashi, AAEA chairperson, said the organization is fairly dormant. He noted that Chinese and Filipino educators from AAEA are still involved in educational concerns but have formed their own groups. Higashi said although an attempt to resurrect AAEA was unsuccessful a year ago, efforts will be made to get it going again.


To get input from the Asian American community, several organizations were invited to participate in the lawsuit. Only the Japanese American Citizens League has participated, but not as a party to the lawsuit. Mich Matsudaira, newly elected President of JACL, said that the JACL has authorized Sam Shoji and Gary Higashi to act as observers at the desegregation meetings. JACL took an official position against Initiative 350 in October of 1978 and generally supports the School District's desegregation efforts.


Although JACL is not a formal party to the lawsuit, it has become the group to represent the concerns of the Asian American community in school desegregation. Shoji felt this came about not as a matter of choice but as a matter of necessity due to limited participation from other Asian American community organizations.


One area of concern is bilingual education. Under the current desegregation plan, when bilingual centers have been put in north end schools, the parents generally have not moved their children with the program. Gary Higashi, head of the Education Task Force for JACL, felt parents of non-English speaking children aren't moving their children because ""bilingual students need an environment of community support around them. The Asian community won't be supportive if it means breaking up the community."" Higashi felt the bilingual issue could be worked on as in other school districts such as San Francisco without conflicting with desegregation plans.


Sam Shoji, the other JACL observer, said if Initiative 350 were implemented, there would be no guarantee of bilingual programming. He pointed out that even though the non-English speaking children might be concentrated in their neighborhood school, federal law (by order of the Office For Civil Rights, of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) requires the school district to disperse minority teachers throughout the school district. Shoji felt it would be impossible to get bilingual education for students because the School District couldn't assign bilingual teachers to those schools with heavy concentrations of non-English speaking children without violating the order. Initiative 350 only applies to student assignment not teacher assignment.


Initiative 350 passed by a large margin in the November elections. Higashi said, ""Even though Initiative 350 had majority approval, this does not make it right. The majority isn't always right. Look at the wartime incarceration of the Japanese Americans. It had majority approval but it is a good example where the majority was wrong.""


If Initiative 350 is upheld by the courts as constitutional, the Seattle School District lawsuit could potentially be a landmark school desegregation case. The Seattle School District is the first school district in the country to implement a district wide desegregation plan without a court ordering it to do so. If the law is upheld, the School District would have to enforce it and, in effect, resegregate the schools.


The Seattle Desegregation Plan was developed from pressure on the school board from community organizations. Sam Shoji believed minority children have always been segregated in the Seattle schools. He said when separate school systems are allowed to exist, minority children suffer.

George Tokuda's drugstore is moving to the International District in December.


And George Tokuda, who began Tokuda Drug over 40 years ago, says he is turning over operation of the store to his assistant, Floyd Horiuchi, who has worked with Tokuda the last three years.


""I'm going to try and leave the store pretty much the same way it has been run as far as customer service, but modernize the drug part,"" said Horiuchi.


Tokuda said there is a need for an Asian drugstore in the International District. ""Before the War, there were seven Japanese drugstores down in Chinatown,"" he said. ""There's not one down there now.""


Tokuda, whose drugstore at 1620 South Jackson has become a neighborhood fixture, said he began his business in 1935, in a building at 18th and Yesler. A flurry of robberies and harrassment forced him to relocate 10 years ago.


""Here, I wouldn't survive without steady customers that have been with me for years,"" Tokuda said, ""I've served some families from grandparents down to grandchildren. Three generations.""


When he first started the drugstore, 90 percent of the neighborhood was Jewish. By the time Japanese Americans were evacuated from the West Coast, ""a handful of Japanese and Chinese had moved in,"" he said. ""When we came back, it was predominantly black.""


Tokuda said he didn't become a pharmacist out of choice, he wanted, first, to become an electrician: ""I went to Everett High School which had the best electrical trade course in the West Coast. If you finished that course with honors -- a grade of Bor better -- you were almost assured of a job."" Six of the students in his class of 28 achieved the honors, Tokuda recounted, including himself. ""The five other students got placed in pretty good jobs,"" he said. ""There were no openings for an Oriental. They kept giving me the run-around.


""After six months of desperately trying, I went to talk to my grade school principal. He knew I was planning to go to the University of Washington. He said I would have to work for someone or go into business myself. That's when I decided to go into pharmacy.""


Tokuda said he will continue to work two or three hours a day assisting Horiuchi.


Horiuchi said he is very optimistic about the growth and revitalization of the District. And Tokuda says, ""I predict Floyd will double the business. At least.""


Tokuda says the new drugstore is scheduled to open Monday, December 3. Address? 609 South Main Street.

King County is ""happy"" no opposition has yet materialized against construction of a work-release facility at the site of the new proposed jail downtown, County Project Manager Robert Wagner said recently.


The County Architecture Division, under a directive from the County Council, had prepared a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) supplement for the Department of Rehabilitative Services, detailing alternative sites for a 300-bed work-release center. The County had earlier pushed strongly for use of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Building for the center, prompting International District opposition and the County Council directive.


According to the EIS supplement, the ""most attractive alternative"" is construction of a new facility on the same site as the new jail, between James and Terrace Streets, and 5th and 6th Avenues.


At a public hearing on the supplement late last month, International District representatives reiterated their opposition to use of the INS building for work-release. They were not particularly enthusiastic about the downtown alternative, but generally favored that site over the INS Building.


Ron Mamiya, president of the International District Economic Association, said the Environment Impact Statements have not addressed the cumulative potential impact of the Kingdome, I-90 corridor, Metro's possible use of Union Station, and an INS-based work-release center. What will be the total effect, he asked, of all these projects on the International District?


Mamiya said he would like to reserve judgment on the alternative of a work-release center at the same site as the new jail, although he added that there are ""substantial advantages"" to housing it there, such as possible joint use of resources.


Bob Santos, director of Inter*Im, said of the International District: ""I don't think there's any other part of the city or the country that has been impacted as much by public uses.""


James Yee, president of the Yee Family Association, said the Chinese community is against use of the INS Building for the work-release center. The EIS supplement, he said, fails to take into account the social mix and educational level of non-English-speaking persons in the District. It fails, he said, to assign a dollar value to the long-term effect in social cost to the District.


Although the County favors the INS site, it is uncertain whether the County Department of Rehabilitative Services will be able to use that site, since County Council President Ruby Chow is spearheading Council opposition. Chow has written a letter to U.S. Senator Warren. Magnuson, asking him to use his ""good office to withdraw the availability of the INS Building for use as a work-release facility."" She added that the District community has no ""assurances that relocated INS services will be convenient.""


Wagner said there ""are still very good reasons for using the Immigration Building,"" but that the decision to do the supplement ""certainly reflects people's apprehensions about using the site.""

A Vietnamese national, convicted of espionage and illegal use of government information, claims his little-known case may have great impact on journalists and researchers wishing to record and publish government documents.


David Truong, a Vietnamese citizen living in the U.S., and American co-defendent Ronald Humphrey were sentenced by a Virginia federal court last May to 15 years in prison. Two of the six counts the men were convicted under have direct implications for the media, Truong told a Seattle press conference recently.


""Information, whether classified or not, is not important,"" Truong said. ""If that information belongs to the government and if you use it without authorization from the government, you are in fact stealing it.""


""The government raised the same issues during the Daniel Ellsburg case, and it failed to win on it,"" he continued. ""Now it's resurrecting that charge.""


According to a former National Security Council aide to Henry Kissinger, the Truong-Humphrey ruling sets a precedent for an Official Secrets Act. Morris Halperin, who testified for the defense, has written that such an act potentially restricts the press from any information generated by a government agency.


A second charge re-defines what information pertains to ""national defense."" Truong claims the prosecution broadened the heading of ""national defense"" information into what should have been ""international activities of interest to the United States,"" which is legal.


""For the first time in the history of this country, they (the prosecution) stretched national defense to include everything under the sun,"" Truong said.


""They claimed the United States is a global power and therefore has global concerns, so anything that happens around the globe is related to U.S. national defense.""


Troung said most of the information he sent to friends in Paris were publications that could be found in shops and bookstores. Two percent of all the evidence, he explained, were secret diplomatic cables he received from Humphrey, then employed at the U.S. Intelligence Agency.


When questioned about the contents of the cables, Truong said, ""You're talking about diplomats chit-chatting to each other, flight schedules coming out of Ho Chi Minh City to Bankok, and some (cables) deal with the economic reconstruction of Vietnam. Nothing relating to the national defense even as defined by the Supreme Court.""


In the trial, Halperin testified the government makes a distinction between ""national defense"" and ""foreign relations"" when classifying its material. He told the jury there was nothing in the cables Truong sent that in any way endangers national security.


Truong is traveling around the country to raise support while out on bail. His oral appeal will go before the Fourth Circuit Court in April. He believes the public is not informed and does not realize the importance of his conviction.


""The ruling on my case will affect Americans much more than what will affect me,"" he said. ""There are very serious Constitutional questions being raised, and I don't think there's been enough visibility of those issues.""

Silks from China and Japan played an important part in the founding of the Port of Seattle and the transcontinental railroads. Seattle: On the Silk Road is the exhibit at the Wing Luke Memorial Museum this month. The exhibit features views of Seattle's role in the silk trade along with garments, yarns and swatches of silks from Asian countries and the United States.


Wing Luke Memorial Museum, 414 Eighth Avenue South, Seattle, WA 98104; MA 3-5124.


A portion of this exhibit displays the silk in its raw forms and details the processes involved in obtaining silk from the silk moths.[*]


The process begins with a number of silk moths, which are placed in baskets to hold the eggs they lay. The moths die.


The eggs are placed on sheets of paper and hung on racks until Spring. The larvae hatch when the mulberry tree begins to leaf. The mulberry leaves are gathered, chopped and placed in the basket with the worms or larvae. They feed noisily for several days and nights, stopping only to sleep.


When the worms are mature they are placed on inclined screens, where they will spin silk as they climb and wrap themselves in cocoons.


The screens are then hung up and covered with cloth. The cocoon skins are allowed to harden for about a week.


Smoke is used to kill the pupae which would otherwise develop into moths and emerge, breaking the silk filaments they are encased in.


The cocoons are softened with hot water. The end of the thread must be found and drawn out. The thread is wound off its skein onto a bobbin and is now ready to weave. The thread can now be woven, dyed, baled and shipped.


After one understands the processes involved in obtaining silk, one can further appreciate the garments and fabric samples on display.


Hanging above a three-panel screen is an indigo dyed silk kimono decorated with cranes. The three-panel screen is wooden-framed, decorated with pheasants in gold and umber tones on silk. The style appears to be of Korean influence, although the newspaper backing the screen is printed in Japanese.


An early 20th century Chinese robe of deep burgundy silk is lined with lambswool and fastened with four round buttons of gold.


One of the most striking pieces in the collection is a Haori coat of aqua and pink silk which has paled with age. The coat is handpainted with a landscape along the outer and inner borders of the lower section. The coat is Japanese in design, but the style of painting and the faces of the people in the landscape seem to be Chinese.

Wendy Yoshimura was born behind barbed wire in a wartime Japanese-American concentration camp at Manzanar, California. On July 17th of this year, Yoshimura went back to a life of incarceration at the California State Prison in Frontera. Yoshimura is serving a one-to-fifteen year sentence for the 1977 conviction on possession of deadly weapons, charges brought in 1972.


Yoshimura's minor role with the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) has been cited as a key factor in her conviction. In 1972, Yoshimura rented a garage in which her friends stored explosives and machine guns. After the much publicized saga of Patricia Hearst, would-be-revolutionary, Yoshimura was charged with possession of deadly weapons. Citing a California decision which upheld a ""use a gun, go to jail"" law, the trial judge said he had no choice but to sentence Yoshimura to a one-to-fifteen year sentence. Yoshimura, however, was not charged with using a gun in the commission of any crime. She was charged with possession of deadly weapons because she rented a garage where deadly weapons were stored. The injustice of this sentence is clear when viewed against the fact that Yoshimura's ""friends"" who stored the weapons did not go to jail, but were given probation as their sentence.


A committee has been formed in California, the Wendy Yoshimura Fair Trial Committee, to seek a pardon from Governor Jerry Brown.


It is clear that Yoshimura was a victim of the backlash which resulted from the publicity surrounding the SLA. Her conviction pales in comparison with the crimes for which Patty Hearst (armed robbery) and Dan White (manslaughter killing of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk) were convicted. Yet, Hearst is free because of Jimmy Carter's intervention and Dan White faces a 7 1/2 year maximum term for his crime. Yoshimura faces a possible 15 year maximum term for her conviction.


Wendy Yoshimura's case is a blatant example of the failings of our criminal justice system. In the two years Yoshimura was free on bail awaiting appeal of her conviction, she was cited by the Alameda County judge for her ""exemplary conduct."" She spent a great deal of her time working with community groups, teaching arts and crafts. For all intents and purposes, she has been rehabilitated. It is highly unlikely she would return to the ""hit and run"" life of her earlier days.


Many criminalogists argue about the purpose of incarceration. Many argue that the criminal offender must be incarcerated until that person is rehabilitated and able to adjust back into society to make positive contributions. Others argue that criminal behavior must be punished, regardless of the mitigating circumstances.


For what possible reason should Wendy Yoshimura be sent to jail at this late date? What purpose does it serve to send Yoshimura to prison after she has demonstrated her ability, willingness, to make a contribution to the community? The sentence seems harsh since her main ""crime"" was renting a garage.


Yoshimura's first incarceration, the internment at Manzanar, was based on a verdict of guilty by reason of race. Her current incarceration is much along the same lines ... guilt by reason of association with the would-be revolutionaries of the SLA.


Equal justice for all? Yoshimura's trial judge said he had no power to grant probation for her. Yet, Patty Hearst is out and the two ""friends"" who had the explosives and weapons which were stored in the garage rented by Yoshimura were granted probation. You can draw your own conclusions.


Editor's Note: Letters of support for a pardon for Wendy Yoshimura should be forwarded to Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., State Capitol, Sacramento, California 95814.

""It's about time we had an Asian on the City Council,"" Kazzie Katayama said. ""It's about time we had an Asian woman on the City Council.""


Katayama's opinion is representative of many other Asians supporting Dolores Sibonga for the Council position being vacated by Tim Hill.


Sibonga, former deputy executive secretary of the State Human Rights Commission, has garnered the most Asian support of the five contenders for Hill's seat. The two top vote-getters in the September 18 primary will vie for the seat in November. The only other candidate with significant Asian support is Nick Licata, an activist on many issues, including energy conservation, low-cost housing and opposition to nuclear power plants.


Sibonga grew up in the International District, served as editor of the Filipino Forum newspaper and president of the Inter*Im Board of Directors. Her strength among Asian voters derives from her longstanding involvement in many Asian groups -- including the Asian/Pacific Women's Caucus, many members of which are working as campaign volunteers.


""Let's face it,"" said Michiko Fujii, treasurer of Sibonga campaign, ""in the Asian community, how many capable candidates do we have who are willing to face the pressure of this kind of campaign? We're lucky to have someone like Dolores in our community.""


Mary Anne Tabor, a volunteer in Sibonga's campaign, said she has never before been involved in politics. ""I respect Dolores,"" said Tabor. ""She has ideals; she's well-informed; she's an honest person. The fact that she's a woman of color means she's had to go through certain experiences that make her sensitive to certain needs.""


But, significantly, a number of Asians have also decided to operate in the Licata camp, including Jan Kumasaka, who chairs Licata's campaign; Doug Chin, a long-time District housing activist; and Glenn Chinn, who heads the Merchants Parking Association.


Licata, who has issued position papers on the International District and Asian Americans, said his Asian supporters are activists. He has called for City support for the Neighborhood Strategy Area housing program, under which low-cost elderly housing and market rate housing can be developed.


Kumasaka said she admires Licata for taking strong stands on issues. ""Dolores hasn't come out too strongly on matter to do with housing,"" said Kumasaka. ""Within the next four or five years that is going to be the crucial issue. More and more poor people are being displaced.


""I think that we've passed the stage of saying we're going to vote for a candidate because they're a minority. In the past that hasn't always worked. I don't think that just because Dolores is a woman and a minority we should vote for her.


Sibonga sees employment as the priority for minority people, saying that a lot of other issues depend on that. ""Affirmative action means a great deal to me,"" she said. Part of thereason she is running is because ""there is still much to do in the area of discrimination,"" she said.


Privately some International District housing advocates have expressed closer allegiance to Licata than to Sibonga, citing Licata's work with the Urban Displacement Coalition. Several mentioned that Sibonga received a campaign contribution from John Sato, who is proposing demolition of a number of homes on Beacon Hill, replacing them with condominiums. Licata has said he opposes the demolition.


Sibonga supporters argue, however, that there are already enough ""white liberal"" Council members and that there is a need for a minority woman on the Council.


""I've known Dolores and have worked with her on Inter*Im,"" said Vera Ing. ""I think Dolores adds a dimension to the City Council and she's more mature.""


Shiz Sata, who coordinates coffee hour presentations on behalf of Sibonga, said, ""The only reason I'm backing her is because she's a woman and an attorney and she's level-headed. I like her. I trust her. I can't see anything specific she would accomplish because I don't know what would come up, but I think she would be fair.""


Both Sibonga and Licata say the Asian community's participation in a campaign can be decisive. Sibonga said candidates have begun to recognize the importance of the Asian vote, pointing out that Council members Michael Hildt and Norm Rice have had campaign offices in the International District. Licata, conceding Sibonga will get the majority of Asian votes, said he considers the participation of Asians ""very important.""


Kumasaka said older generation Asians have not gotten involved in the political process.


""In Japanese culture, we were put in relocation camps and when we came out we didn't want to stand out like a sore thumb,"" she said. ""We wanted to be a good citizen and we wanted to fit in very badly and live out our whole lives without something like relocation happening again. The older generation was turned off to government, but the third and fourth generation now are becoming more active.""

A new store in the District


A new store has opened in the District, Kim Chong Lung, store #2 at 617 S. King.


The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Peter Wong who also own Kim Chong Lung, store #1, found the new store location, across the street from the Hing Hay Park, ideal for the expansion of their business.


The children: Kevin, Richard and Carol have made it a family business. They will be running the second store of Oriental gifts and clothing. The first store, located up the street at 707 S. King, sells grocery and food items.


The new store will be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.


Philippine National Day rescheduled


The Philippine National Day Committee will celebrate Philippine National Day with a barrio fiesta Sunday, June 10 at the Filipino Community Center.


The all-day celebration had originally been scheduled for Saturday, June 9, but was moved to Sunday so it would not conflict with the International District Summer Festival being held Saturday.


The fourth annual National Day celebration will be held to celebrate Filipino national culture and commemorate Filipino contributions to the United States. The 1979 theme is: ""Celebrate Philippine National Day -- Build a United Filipino Community.""


There will be display booths, native foods, a cultural program and games for the whole family.


It will be held 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the Filipino Community Center, 5740 Empire Way S. For more information, call Debbie Ko 322-4467 or Art Ceniza, 285-2475.


JACL dedicates memorial to Minidoka


The Japanese American Citizens League last month announced finalization of plans for the dedication of the Minidoka Memorial Project.


Minidoka, Idaho was the site for one of the camps used to intern Japanese Americans during World War II. The Bureau of Reclamation will survey approximately 5 1/2 acres in preparation for placing a plaque and historical marker indicating Minidoka was once the home of nearly 10,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.


The dedication has been set for August 18.


Plans are underway to renovate: a parcel of land at the former camp's entrance, the remnants of a guard station and the visitor's reception center.


Masa Tsukamoto, chair of the Memorial Project, is urging interested individuals and former camp residents to contact him for further information: Masa Tsukamoto; Minidoka Memorial Project; Route #1, Box 121; Blackfoot, Idaho, 83221.


Bean Sprouts


Bean Sprouts, a bicultural television series for children, has been rejected by the Public Broadcast Service (PBS) for national airing over the public television network. The series is sponsored by the Association of Chinese Teachers (TACT) and Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) with grants from HEW/ESAATV, McDonald's Hamburgers, and others. The series has received praise from throughout the country for its innovative and honest portrayal of Chinese American children. Unfortunately, the programming staff of PBS does not share the same enthusiasm. They have concluded that Bean Sprouts does not have wide audience appeal. TACT and CAA are asking that concerned people write to PBS and tell them that Bean Sprouts should be placed on the national program schedule.

Washington State's Cherry Blossom princess


Jennifer Yih was recently named Washington State's Cherry Blossom Princess during ceremonies early last month in Washington D.C. Yih, a student at the University of Washington is the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Dachin Yih. She graduated from Roosevelt High and was a 1977 Seafair princess. She is currently employed in the office of Washington Senator Warren G. Magnuson in Washington D.C.


The festivities were part of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival in the nation's capitol.


Dolores Sibonga runs for City Council


On April 11, Dolores Sibonga announced her candidacy for the Seattle City Council seat presently held and being vacated by Tim Hill.


Sibonga is a well-known name in the Asian American community, having the notable distinction of being the first Filipino American to graduate from the University of Washington school of journalism and the first Filipino American to pass the Washington State bar exam. She was also editor of the Filipino Forum.


Her connection with the International District has been as a resident (her folks used to run a restaurant in the District many years ago) and as chairperson of the Inter*im board of directors.


Sibonga has served as a lawyer, public defender, a documentary producer for KOMO-TV and, most recently, as deputy executive Secretary of the Washington State Human Rights Commission. She also served as a temporary City Council member when Phyllis Lamphere resigned.


Sibonga faces three announced candidates vying for Hill's seat: Walt Crowley, Nick Licata and Robert Moffett.


During her brief tenure on the Council, Sibonga gained notoriety over her opposition to the City's Office of Policy Planning. Ironically, Sibonga's campaign headquarters are located in the building which used to house the Office of Policy Planning, the Arctic Building, Third and Cherry. For more information, call 624-7762.


Paul Horiuchi for 'preventative government'


""I want to give 200 per cent of myself,"" said City Council candidate Paul Horiuchi in reference to attending to Seattle's needs. One need, the thirty-five year resident sees, is a change in the City Council for new voices and a new spirit.


Horiuchi, 43, is vying tentatively against Sam Smith. He thinks Smith who is seeking his fourth term has done a good job, but it's time for a change. He believes people are most effective and energetic when they start out.


He said he is not the same teacher he was 10 years ago. But one reason for staying at Lake Washington elementary school was his desire for his sixth grade students to have good contact with a non-white, eliminating some prejudice.


The family moved to Seattle in 1944. Paul Horiuchi attended O'Dea High School, then graduated from Franklin High School. He received a BA in music from Seattle University and a masters degree in education from Central Washington State. Since 1962, he has sung with the Seattle Opera Association.


Since his three children have grown up, Horiuchi thought this was the right time to run for a political office. He regards the process of election as politics, but feels that the City Council position is a human service.


Instead of being just an Asian voice, Horiuchi wants to represent the entire city. He said he opposes Smith's proposal to have six members elected from districts because the result would be too much of a political game of trying to win over certain districts. The theme of his campaign is preventative government, to anticipate and solve problems.

In the fall, the Yakima Valley is cool and calm. Early mornings are marked by frost. During the day, there are moments of warmth; the evenings are cool and crisp. For those who inhabit this 60-mile-long valley, it is time to celebrate a productive harvest.


The Yakima Valley has its roots in the late 1800's, when early settlers braved Indian wars and desolate sagebrush lands. A steady influx of new settlers arrived to clear the land and create massive irrigation systems. The Yakima Valley was transformed into an oasis. It produced crops in volumes to rival the output of any other area in the United States.


For Wapato, a town in this valley, there was an additional sense of pride in this accomplishment. Wapato was centrally located, a train depot and several railroad shipping points within its boundaries. It contained some of the most fertile land; and it grew by leaps and bounds.


The huge American Fruit Growers, Inc. built its fruit warehouse and cold storage plant in Wapato, as did a dozen other fruit warehouse firms. They were ready purchasers of the crops.


The city had a social life. Wapato was built around a growing American Legion which boasted a membership of 63 in 1927. The Legion held weekly dances, and a celebration called the ""Fall Frolics"" was held the first week of November. Prior to the celebration, it held a weekend ""Circus"" and ""Night in Paris.""


As Wapato grew, other areas of the United States began to take note. For example, a letter addressed to the Mayor of Wapato appeared in the local paper: Kind sir: I am a refined lady, 50 years of age, a first class cook and housekeeper and very lonely and would like a good husband. Won't you please help me to find one as I understand there are lots of respectable men in your part of the country.


As in many West Coast communities, the city's development was marred by racial conflict. The economic enterprises of the early settlers were heavily dependent upon cheap labor. Their orchards had to be planted, pruned, thinned and picked. The hop yards had to planted, twined, trained and harvested. And the same for potatoes, sugar beets, corn and wheat.


To create this labor pool, farmers began importing labor. Labor contractors were hired and farmers associations stepped in to implement recruitment.


The first to answer the call to work in the fields were the white transient workers. They were joined by Indians who had so-called ""become assimilated.""


By the early 1900's, Japanese began answering this call. The early white workers began buying land, removing themselves from the labor pool. The Indians began finding other lifestyles. The Japanese, hearing of the rich lands reclaimed from the desert, appeared in droves.


In 1891, led by Mr. and Mrs. Kimitano Iskukawa, Japanese began making the Valley their permanent home. In 1905, Kishin Sakei led 40 men from Hawaii to work in a Toppenish nursery. The North West Land Company employed Japanese contract labor to clear and plant the first apple orchard in the lower Yakima Valley.


Many Japanese brought wives, settled and began their own farms. Others -- seeing these successful examples and knowing that, in other parts of the country, vigilante action awaited them -- decided to follow suit.


The Japanese raised a variety of melons, squash, tomatoes, beans, cucumber, peas onions and sweet corn. They catered to the local market. The Japanese created a farming industry which did not directly compete with the huge row farming being done by white settlers. Whites had earlier tried to raise such produce, but because these crops were perishable and involved heavy stoop labor, they turned to other crops: wheat, potatoes and orchards.


Because of the lack of direct competition, agri-businesses only offered minor objections to the Japanese. Agribusinesses did feel, however, that because the Japanese farmers farmed their own land and hired their own people, Japanese immigrants were being removed from the labor pool.


With the removal of Japanese, early white laborers and Indians from the labor pool, other farm workers needed to be attracted to the Yakima Valley, then known as ""the fruit bowl of the nation.""


The Filipinos were the next to arrive from Asia. Following, the Spanish-American War, the United States received the Philippine Islands as its spoils. And after the United States also successfully conducted its first imperialist war, the Filipino-American War, the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands became subjects of the United States.


Millions of Filipinos -- who had been Christianized and acculturated through 400 years of Spanish domination -- were taught English and instilled with the ""Great American Dream"" of riches. They became the answer to the labor pool shortage up and down the West Coast.


The first Filipinos to arrive in the Yakima Valley were Pete Buen and Mr. Ramon. They arrived in Wapato in 1918. The next year word spread and they were joined by Kay and Polly Ibatuan, Policarpo Florencio, Eulgio Kapalongan, Policarpo Valdez and Antonio Del Rosario, Bill Abella and Narcisco Del Rosarair. Next year, nine more Filipinos arrived.


Most were single men, hiring out to farmers in the Valley. They lived communally, scrimping and saving for the day they could secure land and settle in this rich valley.


The local farmers, finding these men to be hardy workers, began to target them for contract labor. They advertised freely and sent their agents to Seattle. During the early winter and spring months, Filipinos found work in California. In the summer, they worked in Alaska. In the fall, some searched for work in the Yakima Valley. By 1927, there were as many as 1000 Filipinos in the Yakima Valley. Most were transient, but all were looking for security through land and marriage.


These men remained single because Filipino society restricted women from leaving their homes in the Philippines and American law restricted Filipinos from marrying whites. Additionally, these men were not permitted to own land or practice many skills that could be acquired in school, such as medicine, law and business.


From the point of view of the farmers, the single, transient Filipinos were ideal workers. Often in dire need of work, they would sometimes toil 16 hours, at lower-than-usual wages. Without families to support and persecuted in many other sectors of American society, Filipinos became wanderers. Once the work was done, many packed up and sought work elsewhere.


However, antagonism did develop between local residents and the young Filipino workers. Denied a social life, except among themselves, they gravitated toward the local women. Having no place to invest their money, they readily bought nice clothes and sometimes collectively bought cars. They congregated on street corners, showing off their suits. They drove by in their fancy new Fords. Many Filipinos began striking up relationships with the more outgoing white women.


This was the setting in which the first Filipino racial conflict of major proportion occurred. On November 5, 1927, five Japanese men were robbed of $300 by three Filipino men at a lodging home operated by Mike Hirai on West First Street. The three Filipinos, formerly workers employed by a Japanese farmer, were said to be retaliating against mistreatment.


With this event as a catalyst, the gears of vigilante action began turning. Local white transients, already irrate with the Filipino laborers for having ""stolen"" their jobs, joined local members of the community in devising plans to rid the area, once and for all, of the invading brown horde.


By Tuesday, November 8, a mob had formed. The mob split into several groups. Each chose a residence, breaking in, destroying its contents and assaulting its occupants. Joe Molina, an elderly Filipino, was forced to drive a mobster and point out Filipino homes. Kay and Polly Ibatuan were beaten and thrown out in the cold. Pete Campo's house and groceries were raided. His produce was dumped.


Filipinos throughout the Yakima Valley were panic-stricken. Many recent arrivals hopped freight trains, others loaded into the cars they owned to flee the area. Some sought refuge in city jails.


Members of the more stable Filipino community gravitated toward the protection of ""white friends."" They gathered in the homes of Mr. and Mrs. Lynn Thompson, Mr. and Mrs. Dave John and Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Wood.


Kay Ibatuan was sent to Olympia to seek help from State officials. He was accompanied by Bernard Rivar and Arcadio Arciago.


Meanwhile, the white mob had issued an ultimatum, giving the ""barbaric black horde"" till 6 p.m., November 10 to clear out of the Valley.


Digging trenches around the house of Mr. and Mrs. Author Brooks, another of their ""white friends,"" the Filipinos prepared to defend their right to stay. Ibatuan and his companions, after wiring Olympia requesting help, returned with guns and ammunition acquired in Yakima. They waited as the clock ticked closer and closer to the 6 p.m deadline.


Meanwhile, the white mob, numbering 300, had been gathering outside the city limits. They prepared to move against the dug-in Filipinos.


The Filipinos waited, patiently hoping for help to come. Their guns were loaded, ready to be fired. Three men were seen approaching their makeshift fortress. The Filipinos were ready.


The men were sheriffs from town. They had received word from Washington D.C. that vigilante action against Filipinos would not be condoned by the Filipino Consulate. The lawmen sought out the mob and dispersed it before it could reach the barracaded Filipinos.


Newspapers blamed the vigilante action on Filipinos for making improper advances on white women and for stealing jobs from white transient workers. The businessmen of the Valley refused to condone such action, denying they had anything to do with the riots. Yet, they openly admitted to the threat of invading Filipinos.


Questions remain: How could vigilante action of this proportion go on for over five days? How could 300 men successfully invade and demolish home after home of Filipino residents and not be caught? The town only had a few thousand residents.


To answer these questions, one must go back to the reason Filipinos were drawn into the Valley in the first place. As a source of cheap labor, they were readily welcomed. Many white workers refused to do the stoop labor for the wages offered.


The farmers associations, with their advertisements and contract labor systems, had helped create this labor pool. But the one thing they feared was the example set by the early Filipino settlers. They feared others would follow the example. The Valley was rich enough to provide homes for all, but greed directed their action toward denying others a chance to settle down.


Playing upon an immense pride and ""Wapatoism,"" these men breeded disgust for those who arrived after all the work was done settling this land. Their motive was to prevent the Filipino transient labor pool from settling down, farming on their own and removing themselves from the labor market.


For the next decade, this central theme dictated race relations in the Yakima Valley. Time and time again, there were attempts to dislodge the successful minority settlers. There was a struggle over the right of Filipinos to lease land from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the ousting of hundreds of Japanese farmers during World War II, when Executive Order 9066 was used as an excuse to regain the land and dislodge minority settlers.

Being part Chinese and growing up with whites, Lily searches for her own identity. She encounters difficulties with her mother, typical of what most teenagers go through. This according to Sharon Miyake, actress, is the theme of the play ""One, Two Cups ...""


Asian Exclusion Act's workshop production of Mei Mei Bressenbrugge's play was an innovative attempt to combine forms of poetry and drama using flashbacks interspersed throughout the play. Oppressed by her mother's tales of her youth in China, Lily is confused and unable to relate to the two different cultures she lives in. The play revolves around Lily's identity crisis and her friendship with Leilani, a younger girl, whom she seeks support from. Both girls are wise yet innocent and at that rebellious age.


""No plays have taken teenagers at that moment seriously,"" said Frank Chin, director. ""It's a rare exploration of the period of the development of a woman's sensitivity. A moment that exists only in childhood and the end of childhood.""


The main characters were played by Bea Kiyohara as Lillian (Lily's Mother), Sharon Miyake (Lily) and Betsy Chin (Leilani). Dick Yokoyama played the gardener.


This play is the first look at teenage girls instead of boys, said Chin. There have been countless examinations of boys because most plays were written by men, Chin explained. It's not really about Asians. Asian plays are expected to have political or sociological messages, according to Chin. They aren't supposed to lend themselves to pure entertainment.


""I'd like to see minorities act in first class plays regardless of specific parts just for stereotype parts,"" said Bea Kiyohara. ""When there are characters that could be anyone, why can't they be ethnic?""

A redress bill to compensate Japanese Americans interned in concentration camps during World War II may take four years to pass because ""the political climate is not yet ready for direct redress,"" said Congressman Mike Lowry, who recently introduced the bill in the U.S. Congress.


Lowry (Seattle Democrat) introduced The World War II Japanese-American Human Rights Violations Redress Act (HR 5977) on November 28.


The product of eight months of work and discussions with Japanese-American citizens in Seattle and elsewhere, HR 5977 is supported by the Seattle chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League, the Church Council of Greater Seattle, and State Commission on Asian American Affairs.


""The serious abuse of governmental power that caused the unfair imprisonment of 110,000 Americans must be condemned in the strongest possible manner,"" Lowry said in a formal introductory statement to Members of Congress. ""We must clearly admit our mistakes and make redress to the people who were harmed.""


HR 5977 would direct the U.S. Department of Justice to locate all individuals of Japanese ancestry who were ""interned or detained or forcibly relocated"" by the U.S. government during World War II to determine how long they were interned, and to make a redress payment of $15,000 plus $15 per day of internment to those people or their direct heirs.


""Racial prejudice fueled by wartime hysteria allowed Japanese-Americans to be singled out and persecuted,"" Lowry said. ""Over two-thirds of those interned were American citizens, and the vast majority of the others were resident aliens, legal guests in our country.""


Lowry said that while a general and growing acknowledgement that Executive Order 9066 was unconstitutional does ""bring visibility to the injustice of internment, I believe that stronger measures are necessary to provide fair redress and to ensure the continued integrity of Constitutional rights and procedures.


""Significant compensation to those interned for material and personal losses must be made,"" he said.


HR 5977 was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Peter Rodino, and it is expected to be referred to the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, which is chaired by Rep. Don Edwards. Their mailing address is Washington, D.C. 20515.


The House Appropriations Committee will also review the bill.


Noting the average length of internment, Lowry asked, ""How can you put a price tag on three years of confinement, three years of an American's life?"" The $15,000/$15a-day amount will be a point of discussion, he said.


Lowry said he is determined to raise the visibility of the issue and through his offices to promote understanding of the grievous injustice that was done and the legitimate need for direct monetary redress.


He noted that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II -- initiated by the President and condoned by Congress and the courts -- was a clearly unconstitutional act and unprecedented in American history. ""The voice of reason was not heard,"" he said. Such a ""mass violation of civil liberties"" must never occur again, and government redress should be made ""as a minimal repayment for their losses incurred.""


HR 5499 proposes an 18-month study of Japanese-American internment during World War II. Lowry said that the study would raise awareness and demonstrate the need and support for direct redress.


Lowry said the the redress bill is fully compatible with HR 5499, The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians Act. The Commission bill is co-sponsored by Lowry and more than 100 other U.S. Representatives, and it is expected to pass Congress next year.


Lowry noted that ""two of the very best Members of the House, and my friends, Robert Matsui and Norman Mineta of California, were themselves interned during World War II."" He promised to cooperate fully with Congressmen Matsui and Mineta on this issue.


Lowry stated that race, religion or language differences must not make any American citizen or legal guest the subject of discrimination or harrassment.


Lowry would welcome testimonials about the losses or damages people suffered as a result of World War II internment. These should be sent to Congressman Mike Lowry, 3400 Rainier Avenue South, Seattle, WA 98144. Please note ""redress"" or ""internment"" on the envelope to assure special handling.


""This was truly an inglorious chapter in the history of our country."" Lowry concluded.

The Union Station site next to the International District might be developed into a ""transfer terminal"" for commuters from the South and Eastside, under a proposal being considered by Metro and a consultant firm.


Metro and the City are studying several options for providing transit service into downtown Seattle. One scheme involves establishment, near downtown, of a north and a south transfer terminal for communters. Busses from the South and the Eastside would unload passengers at the South terminal, possibly Union Station, and from there passengers would board electrified trolleys or fixed rail cars into downtown.


According to Al Kurimura, International District Manager, the City's Office of Policy Planning (OPP) prefers the ""terminal concept option."" And under that option, he added, Union Station ""is the most logical site"" for the south transfer terminal.


In early December, the Port of Seattle shelved its plan to construct a $17 million intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station. The Port's plan drew vehement opposition from District residents, businesspersons and housing advocates who criticized the failure to properly consult community representatives and the potential detrimental effect of the project on the neighborhood.


""It potentially could be a good thing,"" Kurimura said of a transfer terminal at Union Station. The transfer terminal, he said, is much different than what the Port had planned. And if joint development is undertaken by Metro, the City and the International District community, the District could ""get something out of it,"" he said.


In addition to the transfer terminal, Metro is considering concentrating buses along one of the downtown streets, establishing a transit mall.


Glenn Chinn, a member of the downtown task force which will make transit service recommendations, said the group is ""moving toward a combination of the terminal and transit mall idea.""


""A major problem is that the City does not have a concept of what it has planned for downtown,"" said Chinn. ""I'm afraid neither OPP or the mayor understand the importance of doing that.""


Chinn added that the task force's recommendations will state that whatever is done should be ""done with sensitivity to neighboring areas, enhancing rather than detracting from the areas.""


Chinn also pointed to concern that the transfer terminals could decrease bus ridership because people do not like to transfer.


Jim Parsons, of OPP, said it would be better if the transfer terminal were constructed at a site further south than Union Station, because the impact on the International District community could be mitigated. However, it would no longer be within easy walking distance of downtown. He said some kind of tradeoff might have to occur.


Diane Sugimura, chairperson of the International District Special Review Board, said if Metro eventually chose to locate its terminal at Union Station, she would be interested to see how the rest of the site would be developed.


""Will the intermodal idea be pushed again?"" she asked.


A Metro spokesperson assured that if there was a movement to locate a transfer terminal at Union Station, Metro would hold community meetings to receive input.

The University of Washington (UW) has been the recent scene of demonstrations, pro- and anti-Iranian. The largest demonstration attracted over 1500 students in front of the Student Union Building, shouting ""deport, deport, deport the Iranians.""


The sentiment against the Iranians has been compared to that against the Japanese in the U.S. during World War II. I couldn't believe it when someone said that it wasn't the same thing because the Japanese were American citizens whereas the Iranians are not.


So the Iranians are not American citizens. Neither were any of the Japanese or anyone else at one time. Being an American citizen doesn't make one immune from racism, as proven in U.S. history.


Making a group of people (be they Iranians or Japanese) the target of deportation or internment without cause is racist.


Fred Cordova, Manager of UW Press Service, said the University demonstration was scarier than hell. He said crowds were calling to deport Filipinos a few years back.


Throughout history, America has discriminated against its peoples, usually its peoples of color. Witness, for example, the Asian Exclusion Acts, and the segregation of blacks.


Racism is the issue in the mandatory visa check for Iranian students. While one student said anyone violating his or her visa should be deported, the singling out of the Iranians is unfair. It is an effort to look for reasons to deport Iranians. If reasons are found, it is a certainty they will be used.


While the deposed shah and the hostages in Tehran are clearly related, they are also a different issue. The Iranian students in the U.S. had no more say in the takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran than did the Japanese in the U.S. when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.

""Okay, we'll need fifty people to get this kite up!"" The words jumped from the bullhorn and spread excitement into the crowd gathered at Magnuson Park. Hands reached for the heavy line -- novices, first timers, masters -- grabbed on. When they heard the shout ""go!"" they ran in unison down the long concrete walkway. A cheer went up as the graceful giant rose into the sky.


Sports Day was sponsored by The Bon and the Post Intelligencer. The occasion was also the realization of a dream shared by a kiteflyer from Seattle and a handful from Shirone, Japan.


Dave Checkley, founder of the Washington Kiteflyers Association, met Tsutomu Hiroi, a sculptor from Tokyo, several years ago in Denver where Hiroi was a visiting professor. Hiroi, like Checkley, was ""tako-kichi,"" or kite-crazy. A year and a half ago, when Checkley attended a kiteflyers convention in Tokyo, Hiroi introduced him to Kazuo Tamura of Shirone. Tamura said his dream was to come to the United States. He told Checkley if someone would sponsor him and a few other Shirone kiteflyers to the U.S., he would bring materials to make kites and leave his creations there. It wasn't until The Bon began developing its idea for the Orient Expressed, a three week event highlighting the cultures of Japan and China, that Checkley was able to secure a sponsor for Hiroi, Tamura, and five other kiteflyers to visit Seattle.


Kiteflying is a part of everyone's life in Shirone, according to Hiroi. Kites fly from January until June, a time designated as kite season. With obvious pleasure, Hiroi repeated a traditional story which explained how the Shirone Kite Festival began. ""About 300 years ago,"" he began, some people were flying kites on the east side of Nakanokuchi River, which runs through Shirone. One kiteflyer accidentally let his kite drop onto a rice field on the west side of the river. The newly planted field was damaged and people in the villages on the west side became very angry. The villagers decided to settle their dispute in the sky with kites. Huge, rice paper kites with bamboo spines were launched from both banks of the river. The object was to cut the line of the kite from the opposite bank. Once cut free, the kite would fall from the sky like a broken-winged bird. It became an annual event.


Now the ""tako-kichi matsuri,"" or kite-crazy festival, marks a time of relaxation and celebration. During this week in June, the townsfolk of Shirone can relax. Their rice fields are green with new shoots of rice planted by hand. The torturous work is behind them, and there is excitement everywhere as construction begins on the warrior kites for the annual festival.


Construction of these kites is a painstaking procedure. The rectangular kites (""odako"") measure 22 by 16 1/2 feet, and the hexagonal (""rokkaku-dako"") measure 10 by 6 1/2 feet. These giants are not merely made to dance in the wind, they are pieces of art. ""The Japanese say that when many kites fly in the blue sky, it is a museum,"" said Hiroi. ""And when kites fly against the sun, it is like a stained glass window.""


Although Hiroi was the only team member who spoke English, they managed well during their stay in Seattle. Being in the company of other Seattle kiteflyers, a kite language common to Seattle and Shirone kiteflyers helped them communicate. ""There are many countries,"" said Hiroi, ""but the sky is only one.""

The Office of Policy Planning (OPP) has recommended that five International District public service agencies receive $180,200 in block grant monies for 1980 operations. The proposed children's mini-park and housing rehabilitation projects would also receive $247,000 next year, under the recommendations.


Overall, the 1980 recommendations are $17,100 above 1979 funding levels.


Following public meetings the Mayor will submit recommendations to the City Council. The Council will conduct hearings in September and adopt the 1980 block grant program by October 1. If past years are any indication, the City Council will support, if not increase, the Mayor's recommendations for the International District. Last year, the Council voted to provide $10,000 for the Chinese and Indochinese Elderly project of the Chinese Information and Service Center. The Mayor had not recommended this project for funding.


This year District agencies will again seek Council support for needed projects and services. In fact, 1980 could be the most critical year for the ID in terms of housing rehabilitation and community revitalization. Both the Bush Hotel Community Center and Theatre Annex projects of the Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) could enter the construction phase if adequate funding is available. The PDA requested $300,000 in 1980 block grant funds to cover costs of rehabilitating about 145 housing units on the third through sixth floors of the Bush Hotel. OPP recommended that no funds be provided. The PDA should have a case for funding if it can demonstrate that Community Center cost estimates cannot be reduced and that private financing is not sufficient.


Another proposal not recommended for funding is Inter*Im's Single Room Occupancy project. Inter*Im sought $325,000 to cover some of the costs of rehabilitating a hotel building in the District.


The preliminary recommendations do include $200,000 for Neighborhood Strategy Area program implementation to be administered by the Department of Community Development. The $200,000 would be used to cover development costs for housing rehabilitation projects. The money will be available for use by ID property owners, including the PDA, interested in renovating their buildings.

Strong winds and heavy rains in April caused several hotel windows to shatter and fall to the street below. No injuries were reported. IDEC medics were called to a local hotel to check on a man who fell down a flight of stairs. The man was treated for a possible back injury. He was taken to the hospital.


IDEC medics aided a man having breathing problems. An aid unit was requested because the victim seemed to be getting worse. Another call for a medic unit was radioed in and Seattle Fire Department paramedics treated the victim and transported him to Harborview Medical Center (HMC).


IDEC was called to check on a male lying in a stairwell. The medics found an intoxicated male who didn't have a place to sleep and was not eating well. The male refused service even though IDEC called for the detox unit.


Medics were called to a local hotel to check on a sick person. The victim had been on the floor for some time and no one answered the victim's calls for help. IDEC referred the male to the Health Clinic.


On April 24, IDEC medics broke up a fight at Maynard and Jackson. A teenage female and a 28 year old male were yelling at each other when suddenly the male assaulted the female by hitting her in the eye. The female then pursued the male with a knife. IDEC stopped the female and held the knife until the police arrived and took the female into their car. Police went after the suspect.


A 77-year-old male died quietly in his room in a local hotel. The night before police were called to check on a prowler at 8th and Weller. IDEC and aid units were already on the location with a man who had a seizure. There was no prowler. The man had fallen against a door which caused the party to call the police. The victim is doing fine.


Earlier that day a two-car accident occurred at 6th and Jackson. A 44-year-old female was injured in the acccident and taken to HMC by aid car.


In early May, medics responded to numerous calls including: a male who fell down a stairway and was injured; several fights, the worse being a male severely beaten near Uwajimaya one morning by several people; a male who cut his arm badly while opening a window; an arson fire at the Mar Hotel (People spotted smoke coming from the top floors. No real damage was done to the building since it is closed and unoccupied.


Medics state that, as the weather gets hotter, so do the incidents in the I.D. Tempers flair easily. People speed around in their cars more, some drink and can't take the hot humid conditions. Others put much stress on their bodies and may overwork their heart. IDEC wishes all a good spring, but remember to take it slower in the hot weather.

Social service providers should get their ""act together,"" a federal official told about 60 people at the Pacific/Asian Elderly conference in Seattle last month.


Michio Suzuki, deputy commissioner of the Administration for Public Services in Washington, D.C., was referring to the lack of organization among Pacific/Asians. He commented on the problem of ""funding one Asian group and then, one (Asian group) is not happy.""


Charles Reed, Director of the Washington State Bureau of Aging, had stated earlier that the Chinese filed a discrimination suit ""because they didn't want to eat with the (funded) Japanese (elderly) nutrition program.""


There is now a funded Chinese nutrition program to serve the Chinese elderly.


Reed also said the Pacific/Asian group should ""have issues that all (Asian groups) agree on. Don't squabble among (yourselves.""


""We have to get together,"" said Suzuki. ""What are we saying when we say we are Pacific/Asians?"" ""Asian"" is a relatively new term, he said. Most elderly think of themselves as Chinese, or Japanese, etc.


Dr. Sharon Fujii, DHEW (Department of Health, Education and Welfare) of Region IX, gave a report on the Pacific/Asian Elderly Research Project, which was completed over a 23-month period in June, 1978. The report found, Fujii said, ""a general absence of information on the Pacific/Asian elderly.""


Why invest money in research when the money can go into services? she asked. She said the studies are necessary to ""plan services and develop programs"" crucial to funding.


Sally Kazama, one of the local service providers, commented on the results of the 1977 Assessment of Needs of Elderly in the State of Washington. ""Because I happened to be on the Washington State Council of Aging at the same time, I asked how many non-English speaking elderly did (the local firm who handled the study) interview in (their) program. He said, 'If any, none.'""


Kazama, frustrated at the insensitivity and lack of awareness of the ""professionals,"" said service providers should ""get together to get good recommendations"" for their programs.


Four workshops were held in conjunction with the conference objectives:


--to provide information regarding the needs of Pacific/Asian elderly to decision makers, service providers and consumers,


--to recommend means by which existing programs can be improved to increase their utilization by Pacific/Asian elderly and new programs to address unmet needs of this target group,


--to develop a network among service providers to Pacific/Asian elderly community and ongoing contact between such providers and regional and national decision makers.


Doris Lock, evaluator at the Bilingual Education Technical Assistance Center of Seattle, gave a brief historical background of the three largest Pacific/Asian groups: Chinese, Japanese and Filipino.


Many Pacific/Asian elderly are single today and do not speak English. Lock said they are reflective of the conditions of Asian-American history.


Hannah Hirabayashi, staff member of the Pacific/Asian Elderly Project and organizer of the two-day conference, felt a lot of good things were said at the conference. But ""it could just be talk again,"" she added.

The end of September is a crucial time for many community organizations, including those in the International District. It marks the end of the eighteen month period for these organizations' employees funded by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Those who have served the community for 18 months will no longer be paid by CETA. For those employees who can't be picked up by other sources of funding, CETA is kicking them out to look for work in other areas. The loss of these employees has a direct impact on the ability of community-based social service agencies to provide services to those who need it.


According to the annual plan for the King-Snohomish Manpower Consortium (which administers the CETA programs), the goals for Public Service Employment (which funds the employees of such agencies as the Asian Counseling and Referral Service and Inter*Im) are:


1. To place primary emphasis in public service jobs on meeting individual participant employability development needs, not on providing public services.


2. To direct PSE (Public Service Employment) resources to those activities which will attain maximum transition of public service job holders into unsubsidized employment opportunities within the private sector.


Rather than placing some priority on community needs, the current application of the CETA program is viewed in quantity (the number of people placed in public service jobs) rather than quality (continuity of service to the community.)


Hence, when the eighteen month period is over for CETA eligibility, many people who have been trained and who have worked in public service employment (PSE) suddenly are dumped into the street. The intent of the current CETA PSE program is that these former CETA employees can find employment in the private business sector. In theory, developing employability of CETA participants is a worthy goal. In reality, it is a program of limited success.


For example, most people who work in social services work for the government. Social services in relation to meeting basic community needs such as health, housing, and maintenance of the very low-income, simply does not exist in the private sector. It's not at all compatible with the profit margin. What chance does a housing advocate have in obtaining employment with a developer?


The role of CETA in PSE must be seriously questioned. It makes the commitment to the community by funding employees of social service agencies to provide direct services to the community only to yank the rug out after 18 months. Each year, community agencies must submit proposals to the CETA program to fund direct services and each year the money allocated to each program is cut back further.


Community service agencies which are awarded CETA funding for employees are faced with a ""revolving door"" effect every 18 months as CETA eligibility runs out and employees no longer eligible for CETA are replaced by new CETA employees. The loss of old employees diminishes the effectiveness of the social services offered by the community agencies. The new employees are expected to relearn the knowledge learned by the former CETA employees, re-establish the credibility of the agency because they are new, and relearn the availability of resources in the community. Continuity of service is staggered at best.


In the area of public service employment, equal consideration should be made for both the community and the individual. Flexibility should be allowed so that individuals who wish to remain in public service in the community be allowed to do so rather than cutting them off after 18 months. The individual and the community would be better off.

Many Indochinese refugees resettle in Washington State. Five thousand out of the 9,000 resettled in Puget Sound. Many services are available to them in Seattle. Services include training for employment, learning English for survival, and maintaining mental and physical health.


The EOC (Employment Opportunity Center) assists refugees to find jobs. But to be eligible for a job, a refugee first must gain necessary skills and learn basic English. The Superintendent of Public Instruction English as a Second Language Programs are primarily located in Seattle. Seattle Community College offers 10 ESL classes for about 190 students. Renton Vocational Technical Institute provides English classes with bilingual teachers and training for welding.


In the International District, the Chinese Information and Service Center has an ESL class. Melody Leo said that once agency funds are stable again, a tutoring program will start. Eighty per cent of the refugees speak Chinese, she said, and many come in need of translation or help in filling out applications. Due to the increased number of Indochinese and only six staff members, Leo continued, clients sometimes have to wait.


The ID Community Health Center is swamped, admitted Director Jon Nakagawara. The staff is too small to handle a 45 per cent patient increase this year, he said. The Health Center works closely with the Health Department and voluntary agencies and Indochinese refugees come to know of the Center's existence. It is the only agency providing medical service for such a large number of Indochinese -- an average of 16 a day, according to Nakagawara.


The Health Center treats Indochinese patients for minor illnesses or skin problems and also immunizes the children. Clients are charged according to income and family size. The Asian Counseling and Referral Services (ACRS) takes care of mental health problems. It also is involved in getting refugees into training programs. Six Indochinese counselors help about 200 Indochinese refugees a month, according to David Okimoto, ACRS director.


The Indochinese Service Center occupies the original site of Chinese Baptist Church. It is associated with EOC. The center assists in translation. Its staff also prepares refugees for citizenship. About 3,000 refugees will be eligible to become citizens by next year. All the staff members are refugees. Three are Laotians who occupy CETA positions.

The pieces of the mini-park puzzle finally are fitting together as the state recently provided a $150,000 grant for construction. Inflation and rising construction costs, however, may take their toll.


According to Linda Thompson Black, Project Manager for the Parks Department, construction could begin by April. The designer, Joey Ing, anticipates a four-to six-month construction period. With luck, the long-awaited children's minipark will be completed by early fall, 1980.


Ing assigned his associate Steve Shoji to focus on a development which would incorporate Chinese, Filipino and Japanese elements. A special effort was made to design a park which would include play apparatus which blended with the natural vegetation of the mini-park. In early summer, 1979, Ing completed a design which included the Ying and Yang symbol, a sculptured dragon within a sandy play area, a covered pavilion, a bamboo jungle and other play areas using Asian vegetation. The design was well received by community groups including the Public Authority, International District Economic Association and the Review Board. The earlier divisiveness that had marked the siting problems in prior years evolved into unanimous community support.


In 1974, the shadow of the new King County domed stadium loomed over the community when Diana Bower and others prepared a proposal for a children's park in the District. A total of $90,000 in Forward Thrust park bond funds was available, and all that was needed was to find a site.


An ad hoc committee met throughout 1974 and 1975, trying to find a site for the mini-park. Originally it was hoped that the mini-park could be part of the community center. Delays in establishing the Public Authority forced the committee to look at other sites.


In fall, 1975, five possible sites were selected, all within one block of South Weller Street between Sixth Avenue South and the freeway. Months of frustrations followed as each site proved to be unavailable. Additional problems facing the ad hoc committee were financing, planning and design by the City.


In January, 1976, the ad hoc committee submitted a petition to Councilmember John Miller, Chairman of the Parks and Public Grounds Committee of the City Council. The petitions and cover letter urged the City Council to ""immediately appropriate the necessary funds for acquisition and design so that the mini-park can be realized without delay."" The petition stressed that the 95 children in the District were forced to play in alleys and along the streets. Within a month, a senior planner from the Parks Department was assigned to work with the community on the mini-park. The Parks Department planner stressed that the limited budget of $90,000 had to cover site acquisition, planning, design and construction.


By spring, 1976, a site for the mini-park had not been acquired. By May, 1976, it appeared that the Parks Department was willing to give up on the project. The Department said, ""In light of the fact that (1) a willing seller or suitable site has not been found, (2) that our Department will not resort to condemnation in acquiring a site, and (3) that we are not receiving unified public support for any additional acquisition in the area, we have suspended all active negotiation."" With inflation continually eroding the allocated funding for the park, the community and the Department of Community Development (DCD) next turned to the possibility of locating the mini-park on a roof top.


Through summer, 1976, the community and the DCD found possible sites for the mini-park. However, the Parks Department rejected them for one reason or another. ""The frustration we all had was with finding a site which was acceptable and posed no problems in acquisition for the Parks Department,"" Doug Chin recalls. Several ad hoc committee members felt good sites were available; however, the Parks Department was unwilling to make a decision.


In fall, 1976, the Parks Department and DCD reconsidered the possibility of adding the mini-park to the Maynard Avenue or King Street sides of the Hing Hay Park. However, by November, 1976, the Parks Department appeared to give up. With pressure mounting for completion of Forward Thrust parks within available funding, the Parks Department told DCD, ""The Department is placing this project into a re-evaluation status as part of the Forward Thrust reprogramming effort."" At the urging of the community the Mayor and City Council did not reprogram the funds.


With funding assured through the end of 1977, DCD pressed for a resolution of the siting problem. A task force including DCD, the Parks Department and community representatives was formed in January, 1977. It was decided to pursue the possibility of incorporating the mini-park into the Hing Hay Park. Both the Parks Department and adjacent businesses were very concerned about expansion into adjacent streets. The debate continued through the spring and into the summer of 1977 on whether the mini-park should be added to Hing Hay Park. The project was stalemated.


By the end of summer it appeared that the dozens of meetings and hundreds of hours the community had put into the project would be wasted for lack of a site. However, in October, 1977, Inter*Im notified the City of a site at the corner of Seventh and Lane. The Parks Department felt the site was suitable for a mini-park, but warned that purchase of the property could consume all the available funds. With the siting problem apparently solved, attention turned to funding for design and construction of the mini-park. An additional $26,000 in block grant monies was provided for the mini-park.


By the end of the year selection of a design consultant for the mini-park was underway. In January, 1979, Joey Ing and Thomas Berger were selected by the Parks Department as design consultants. The City Council also appropriated an additional $40,000 in block grant monies. The pieces of the mini-park puzzle were coming together.


By mid-summer it was obvious that the available funds (approximately $50,000) would not cover the cost of construction. Given the strong community support and the unique character of the mini-park, the Parks Department decided to seek a $150,000 grant from the State Interagency Committee on Outdoor Recreation. A local match of $47,000 in 1980 Block Grant funds was also requested. Without the additional funding the mini-park as designed could not be completed.

There are many individuals who make up the International District Community. It is said that the International District Community is the most together community of its type in the nation. Just think about it. We have Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, White, Black, Native American and Chicano residents who are below the average income levels. The business owners and property owners, mostly Asian, are traditionally hard working and conservative. And the activists who work in the various agencies are more progressive and liberal.


Together we have built housing, a health clinic, a community garden, nutrition programs, street improvements, a child care center, a merchants parking association which operates fourteen parking lots, a $3 million community center, a public corporation, and a Special Review District Board. Key to this community cooperation is the involvement of the business community.


A very positive trend we have seen in our business community is the family operated businesses being carried on by the sons and daughters of the owners. In the past the sons and daughters would get their degrees and follow new professions, causing shop owners to transfer or close the businesses when retirement became eminent. Today, the family businesses are thriving and the most prominent are the Yee family of Hong Kong Restaurant, Louie/Hong family of Atlas Restaurant, Moriguchi family of Uwajimaya, Wong family of King Chung Lung, Takei family of Tenkatsu Restaurant, Woo family of Quong Tuck Restaurant, Lee family of Wah Young, Chin family of Wah Sang, Louie family of Kwan On Wing, Eng family of Tom Hong, Quan family of Tai Tung, Seko family of Bush Garden Restaurant, Ikeda family of Ikeda & Co., Louie family of Tsue Chong Co., Chin/Lum family of Four Seas, Hidaka family of Jackson Furniture, Chin family of United Savings and Loan, Omura family of Chiyoko Restaurant, Yamaguchi family of North Coast Importing, Suyama family of City Produce, Hagimori family of Kiki Beauty Salon, Kitamura family of Kokusai Theater, Matsuoka family of International Reality, Shinbo family of Garland Florist, and the Kinomoto family of Kinomoto Travel.


Many individuals from these families are involved in Inter*Im, I.D.E.A., Chong Wa, Chinatown Chamber, Chinese Associations Alliance, the International Special Review District Board, the Public Authority and Wing Luke Museum.


These family businesses are the strength of our community because they cater to the needs of district residents, employees of other businesses and visitors. Any type of new development must be compatible with the established family businesses because we have put in years of time and investment to maintain our unique community.


Like all other communities, we have had our differences. But when the district is threatened by non-conforming uses by outside development interest, we have shown our collective muscle and have educated slick professional planners and developers that we are determined to progress and grow at our pace and on our terms.

Young Asian females, who often manage to avoid the juvenile justice system, need to be recognized and helped, participants said last month at a conference on juvenile delinquency.


The western regional conference, held October 18 at Seattle University, was designed to address the needs and problems of Asian females 12 to 17 years old. It was sponsored by the Organization of Pan Asian American Women as part of a national juvenile justice project.


The Asian female is unique and cannot be treated in conventional ways, community workers and leaders said.


""The Asian female gets a double whammy of the Asian culture's chauvinistic views,"" said Cheryl Chow, principal at Seattle's Sharples Junior High School.


Strong cultural expectations, coupled with society's sexist views of women, Chow explained, burden and frustrate Asian females.


""You, as Asian women, are the enemy of every single person, ""Chow told about 100 people attending the conference. Most were Asian women.


""You're the scapegoat of the community.""


Because of societal pressures, Chow said, few Asian females surface in the juvenile justice system, but she maintained that delinquency is still a problem among them.


Bernadette Agor-Matsuno, community organizer for the Seattle Police Department's Crime Prevention Division, noted that six years ago few Asian offender cases reached the public defender's office.


When she worked in the office, Agor-Matsuno said, she ""never saw an Asian face."" Asians, she said, were not likely to be involved in hardcore criminal acts.


Agor-Matsuno said, however, that the number of Asian offenders has increased steadily in the past four years and the number of Asians arrested for serious crimes has also risen.


""We are fortunate to not have a crisis,"" Agor-Matsuno said. ""We should be concerned.""


""There are a number of Asian girls who shoplift, who feel they have to cheat,"" Chow said. These girls do not receive the attention and help they need, she said, because they have ""learned to do it quietly.""


The covert nature of delinquency among Asian females, Agor-Matsuno said, prevents them from getting the treatment they need. Most services are available only after court referral.


""Youths must be inside the system before services are available to them, but even this does not guarantee they will receive the needed services,"" Agor-Matsuno said.


Josephine Gampon, a sociologist at the Santa Clara North County Mental Health Community Center in Palo Alto, California, said that Asians face different problems from whites in going to a mental health center.


Non-Asian therapists, she said, were not sensitive to ""Asian"" problems. They did not understand, for example, the deep sense of shame a Filipino family felt, first because schizophrenia fell into the family and second, because Gampon, another Filipino, was witness to the shame. The communication gap between immigrant parents and children, extended families, and subtle discrimination were other problems cited by Gampon.


Wakiji said the conference, which encouraged minority-involvement in policy formation, was one solution. But other problems remain.


""We need to reconsider our approach,"" Agor-Matsuno said. ""There are too many reactive programs where services are provided only after a pattern has been established.""


""We don't even have building facilities to promote any kind of activity for the Asian community -- not to mention the Asian female,"" Chow said.


""And Asian females are going to have it even tougher when they get into the business world.""


""There is a need for Asians to be seen as therapists, not on the other side of the desk,"" Gampon said.


Betty Wakiji, Pan Asian's eastern regional coordinator said services responsive to community needs would help prevent institutional racism.

Tommy Oiye usually gets a funny reaction from people when he tells them he makes the fresh tofu at Uwajimaya. Perhaps they expect him to say he works at a more ordinary job; or perhaps they cannot readily picture a Sansei performing such an ancient craft.


No considerable amount of attention has been given to tofu production by the Asian American community. Tofu has always been available -- in the shop, soaking in a bucket of water, or in those plastic containers with see-through tops. There is no cause for wonder at this protein rich food because, as Oiye says, ""we'ye eaten tofu all our lives.""


Yet what about the reception of tofu by other Americans? Tofu, a traditional Asian food, has recently begun to find its way into the kitchens of other Americans.


Tofu is a soy bean product. The beans are soaked in water, ground, and cooked. The soft mixture is poured into pressing sacks to squeeze out the soy milk. The soy milk is heated, and solidifying salts are added. The solution is curdled. The curds are put into a settling mold to be pressed and form its shape. After cooling, it is cut into blocks.


Knowledge of the production process is not enough, says Oiye. Many variables affect the product. For instance, how long should the soy beans soak in water? How much water should be added to the beans as they are ground? The set-up of machinery and equipment can affect the method of tofu making, Oiye pointed out. He exemplified Island Spring Soy Bean Products of Vashon Island. Island Spring is capable of manufacturing on a larger scale than Uwajimaya and requires different methods. New, more sophisticated machinery would also alter the method.


Tofu production is a craft to some, according to Oiye. The process is perfected and there are no variables. Sometimes, says Oiye, these craftsmen like to keep their method secret. It tends to ""make their product special,"" he says.


Oiye recalled that the first batches he made when he began two years ago had to be dumped. Oiye learned by doing, and has gradually developed his own procedure for making tofu, although he admits he is still learning.


""To me, tofu is like bread,"" says Oiye. There are so many different kinds, and everyone has their own opinion as to what tastes right and wrong. Tofu varies in taste and texture, depending on how it is made. Sometimes the differences are so subtle, only tofu craftsmen can detect them.


There is another perspective to the manufacture of tofu as well -- that of aggressively marketing this previously unknown product on a wider basis. ""Island Spring has actually paved the way,"" Oiye says, toward marketing tofu and getting it accepted by the general public. Since local tofu makers are satisfying the demand of the Asian American population, Island Springs is more concerned with distributing its product to the general public.


Island Spring Soy Bean Products is located in the middle of an orchard operation on Vashon Island. Inside, fragrant steam fills the high-ceiling room. Workers with rubber boots slosh in the water covering the cement floor as they go about their tasks.


William Luke Lukoskie, who owns the majority of Island Springs, discovered the nutritional value of tofu because of his vegetarian diet. He was immediately impressed. According to Lukoskie, an acre of land used to plant soy beans yields 20 times more consumable protein than an acre of land used to feed cattle for beef.


Tofu is also a natural food. It has no additives or preservatives. Tofu would seem like a health food hero, but acquiring a market, Lukoskie found, was a painstaking process. The Island Spring advertising program has an educational format: Ingredients of Island Spring's seven soy products are explamed and suggestions for preparation are given. Thus, says Lukoskie, the first two questions invariably asked by customers are answered: What is it? and What do I do with it? Tofu and other soy products have turned up in western recipes -- placed between 2 hamburger buns, in lasagne, dressings, and on and on. Island Spring is chipping away at the biggest sales barrier -- ""unfamiliarity.""


Lukoskie first started selling Island Spring products to a grocery chain with a gourmet section, whose patrons would likely be more educated about different types of foods. Island Spring's primary goal is for people to purchase soy products because they know they are nutritionally good for them.


The ever-increasing number of soy bean manufacturers across the nation has reflected the growing enthusiasm for soy products.


The Soycrafters Association of North America (SANA) was founded in 1978, to bring professionalism to soy bean manufacturers in the United States and around the world. SANA's goals include developing publicity for soy manufacturers, research projects, and marketing -- ""to actively encourage the introduction of soy food into the American mainstream, federal school lunch programs, institutions and hospitals."" SANA also hopes to serve as an information center and adopt manufacturing standards for the product.

Several renovation projects in the International District already are or will be under construction this summer including the Community Center Annex, owned and managed by the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation Development Authority (Public Authority). Completion is scheduled for this fall. The Public Authority is a quasi-governmental agency, chartered by the city to promote development in the International District.


The two-level complex, located at 7th and Jackson, will be the headquarters of three ""alternative"" theatre groups and will provide meeting space for the International District's organizations, according to Rod Clarke, project architect.


The Annex's lower level will have a 175 seat theatre/auditorium and will include rehearsal and office space for three resident theatre groups: the Asian Exclusion Act, Red Earth Performing Company and the Womyn's Theatre.


Bea Kiyohara of the Asian Exclusion Act said the performing companies proposed leasing the site for a resident theatre in 1977. The search for theatre space was motivated by the lack of affordable performing space available to alternative theatre groups, she said.


Lease of the Annex theatre with the city's Community Development Block Grant funds will now provide them with working and performing space headquartered in the International District and draw people into the area rather than disperse the companies and their audiences to other areas, Kiyohara said.


The Annex's upper level will provide the community with over 6,000 square feet of space for their needs, Clarke said. The design of the upper level, according to Clarke, is flexible enough to hold art exhibitions, cultural events, receptions, or serve as a large meeting area which the Bush Hotel renovation project (community center) does not readily provide. Clarke said people have expressed concern that the Community Center Annex would not be responsive to or fulfill the community's needs. As workable as proposed plans are, Clarke said, upon completion, some of these centers are not accessible to or are not used by the community; but, he continued, this concern is not unique to the Annex, other community center projects in Seattle and other major cities have drawn similar concerns.


The Annex's success is dependent upon prudent management and administration of the Public Authority and involvement of the community.


According to Clarke, preliminary work will begin in mid-July to rehabilitate the existing building (formerly the T & C Garage) with completion of the lower level slated for mid-October, 1980. Use of the upper level is presently projected for late November.

The Asian Counseling and Referral Service, which provides social services stressing mental health care to a predominantly Asian population, is going into the housing business to provide care for Asians with mental health problems.


In a joint venture with the Seattle Housing Authority, ACRS submitted a proposal to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services requesting funds to build a six unit (one-bedroom) apartment building for six mentally impaired individuals who are ""still capable of improvement and able to live independently with support services and participation in the (ACRS) mental health treatment program."" The program would be for minorities with little or no English-speaking ability. SHA would have control of the selected site while ACRS would operate the facility.


Final approval is pending from the state's legislature, said ACRS director Dave Okimoto, but ""we are optimistic of approval.""


Candidates for the housing, Okimoto said, include ""many of the people who are living in our hotels right here and now. They are eligible for this program."" There will also be people in nursing homes who are not receiving appropriate care and ""some will have a history of being in mental institutions but were placed there inappropriately because of language and cultural differences. They definitely have some kind of problem but because they can't communicate (with institutional staff), the institutions don't know what to do with them.""


ACRS would provide ongoing treatment to the six clients.


ACRS prefers to build the facility in the International District. ""But we may not be able to find anything here."" The advantages of being in the I.D., Okimoto continued, is that ""we would be serving a group of people who are from the I.D."" Also, it would be close to a variety of other cultural activities, and ACRS has its own facilities to provide the necessary support services to the clients.


Okimoto stresses that these clients would be Asians with mental health problems rather than with mental illness, which he says is only one aspect of mental health care. ""We prefer to view mental health care from a stress model,"" he said. ""Any group undergoing stress can benefit from coming to our agency. Stress is related to a loss of status, a break-up in the family, unemployment. All these create stress.""


Within the Asian culture, according to Okimoto, those types of problems were dealt with by the family and the community, but when Asians came to the U.S., the family and community support groups began breaking down or did not exist.


""Asians are underrepresented in the mental health system,"" Okimoto said, ""so it appears that Asians do not have mental health problems."" But there are Asians in mental institutions, half-way houses and hospitals who need care. ""For Asians,"" he said, ""mental health care is a foreign concept. Asians tend to see mental health as mental illness. In their native country, mental illness is highly stigmatized.


""We need to demystify mental health. Everyone encounters stress."" Okimoto said he recognizes the possible controversy of the facility in the I.D. community but ""we are talking of (only) six units and these people are in our community right now. The six units, we felt, were manageable, of small enough size that it would not create a community impact. We are not about to come in with 60 units.""


ACRS begain in 1973 and currently has a staff of 30. The agency started because ""we found that there were a lot of mental health problems in the community not being dealt with,"" Okimoto said. The agency, he said, tries to ""draw upon the entire body of knowledge available from the western (culture) model of mental health care as well as the native culture model (eastern models). We try to combine the best of both. We use a person from the client's culture who understands the culture and the language the client speaks. We provide bilingual, bicultural health care.

""People are receptive to an Ondeko-Za performance because it is a universal expression of life,"" said Ken Kochi, regional manager for the group. ""It is like a common language everybody can relate to.""


Ondeko-Za, established about ten years ago on the island of Sado in the Sea of Japan, performed at the Seattle Center during the Cherry Blossom Festival. The group's thirteen members performed the traditional folk music of Japan using flutes, three-stringed shamisens, and o-daiko (drums).


The O-daiko performance was exceptionally inspiring because of the drummers' energy and concentration. Their movements were agile and powerful.


According to Kochi, the group attempts, through the performance on the drums, to express the sound of nature -- the whispering, sighing and crying of the winds, the cracking of thunder, the pounding surf of ocean waves; and to interpret those sounds as emotions of joy, love, hate and anger.


The Ondeko-Za group spent five years in austere seclusion from the outside world, mastering the arts while developing the physical fitness required for the vigorous performances on stage.


The group awoke daily at 4 a.m. to begin the athletic activities with the belief that physical exercise would cleanse the thoughts and reveal the spirit of ""the sound"" within their bodies.


Toward the end of their performance at the Cherry Blossom Festival, the group walked to the front of the stage, and started clapping a simple rhythm called Sakayauta (Sake making). The audience enthusiastically clapped along. ""It is a universal common language,"" Kochi says.

Over 800 members of the Cannery Workers Union Local 37 International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) elected one of the youngest Executive Councils in the history of the Union. The Union, based in Seattle, dispatches many Filipino workers to Alaska to work in the canneries. Leading the way was Constantine ""Tony"" Baruso who successfully won reelection as president/business agent for the third consecutive term. Baruso has been an elected official of Local 37 for over 25 years. He soundly defeated Cef Decanay Sr. by a vote of 618 to 110.


In the race that drew the greatest attention during the election, Executive Council Member Gene Viernes defeated incumbent Rudy ""Tambok"" Nazario for the Union's Dispatcher position by a 427 to 301 margin. Viernes, 28 and a member of Local 37 since 1968, ran on an 11-person slate that advocated fair dispatch among other things. Viernes' victory is expected to generate much interest amongst the membership because of the controversy that has surrounded the Union's dispatch procedure.


Also waging successful campaigns for reelection were Secretary Treasurer Silme Domingo and Vice President Nemesio Domingo. Both Domingos were unopposed in their respective positions and received tremendous support in the balloting.


Other candidates elected or reelected to serve on the Union's 17-person Executive Council were: Pantal Cabuena as Patrolman; Lynn Domingo, John B. Hatten and Marian Bautista as Trustee; and Jaime Costales, John Foz, Abe Cruz, Rudy Rodriquez, Emma Catague, Glenn D. Suson, Angel Doniego, Terri Mast and Mac Callueng.


Immediately following the election, President Baruso called upon all newly elected officers and members of the Union to ""help build a strong union."" Baruso is now faced with the task of organizing the new Executive Council which will lead the growing Local 37's membership. Local 37 presently stands as the biggest IL WU Iocal with jurisdiction in Alaska and one of the biggest locals in the entire IL WU.


Many members of the Union are expecting to see important changes within the Union over the next two years.

Desegregation has taken a toll on four Chinese Lion Dance groups in southend schools. Sonny Kwan, a 10th grade student, wants to go to Cleveland High School because of the Lion Dance group there. However, he is being denied admission because it would add to a racial imbalance at Cleveland, say public school officials


Kwan made two transfer requests to the School District. Each time Kwan was turned down because school officials said there weren't sufficient reasons to transfer him to an already racially imbalanced school. Cleveland's minority student population, at 63.2 percent, exceeds school district limits. The school Kwan was sent to, Rainier Beach, has a 51.8 percent minority population.


Kwan has appealed to the Seattle School District Placement Board, School Superintendent Dr. David Moberly and the Seattle School Board without success.


According to Kwan, Cleveland offers three things other schools do not, the Lion Dance group, the Chinese language program and the radio communications program. The school district is willing to send Kwan to West Seattle, where Chinese language classes are provided and to Nathan Hale, where a communications program is available. No other schools have a Lion Dance group, which is not considered part of the school curriculum. ""Cleveland has all the things I want,"" said Kwan. ""You find me another school in Seattle that has them all and I'll go.""


Seeking support for his cause, Kwan has obtained 265 signatures on a petition from students and teachers at Mercer Jr. High, Franklin, Cleveland, Rainier Beach, Nathan Hale and Ballard high schools. Letters of support have been written by the International District Economic Association, Sharples Jr. High, and the bon Marche (for Orient Expressed) and others.


""If you're a minority,"" said Jim Diers, spokesperson for SESCO (South End Seattle Community Organization), a group working for equality in busing between northend and southend schools, ""you can't transfer from one minority impacted school to another. If you're in the majority, you can transfer anywhere you want. A white student can go to any school, Sonny can't. It would be different if the things he wanted weren't at Cleveland. He's being denied equal access to education.""


The Cleveland group is the last of four Lion Dance teams in southend schools. Sharples, Mercer and Franklin teams have been disbanded because of busing. ""There are not enough Chinese to even have a fiveperson team,"" stated Cheryl Chow, Principal of Sharples Jr. High in a letter of support for Kwan. ""In the past, there has been 95-150 Asian students, this year there has been a total of 15.""


The Cleveland team is a part of the Chinese Club at the school. Kwan received an honorary T-shirt from the group last year for helping while he was a student at Mercer. ""Mercer didn't have a group last year,"" said Kwan. ""They bused all these guys who were good at the Lion Dance to other schools like West Seattle and Queen Anne."" Because the Cleveland team is now short on members, Kwan, a sophomore who could take over the team, is afraid the group may not survive. ""It will eventually die because no one will take care of it,"" he said.


Some students have been involved before but lost interest. ""They speak more English than Chinese,"" said Kwan. ""They don't know much about culture."" With seven members graduated last year, the Cleveland team only has five members this year. Only three of those have experience. Although five people are required to perform the dance, more are needed to give the others a rest. ""After performing for 10 minutes, you get tired,"" said Mr. Gene Kwan, Sonny's father. ""New people have to take over.""


Gene Kwan, who teaches the Lion Dance to his kids at home, says it is a proud symbol of the Chinese group. ""When I was young in China, I did the Lion Dance. I try to require my kids to learn the Lion Dance. I know how to play the drums and hold up the head of the lion. I always teach them how. All my kids know how to do it a little.


""You have to know the Kung Fu techniques of it,"" said Sonny Kwan, ""you have to be strong to do it. They imitate the movements of the lion. It looks easy, but if you try to do it, it's very hard. In Hong Kong, they won't let you do the Lion Dance until after you have a degree in Kung Fu."" There are five positions in Lion Dance; drums, gong, cymbal and the head and tail of the lion.


Cleveland's Lion Dance group performed over 30 times last year. Performances included the Majors Conference held recently, the Seattle Tennis Club, Orient Expressed and in Olympia for the governor. ""We don't perform for profit,"" says Kwan. ""I want to spread this part of the culture around. During New Years, the lion goes around all the shops. At Cleveland, the lion visits all the classrooms on all three floors and brings good luck to all the rooms.""


""I want to go to Cleveland because it has real good atmosphere,"" commented Kwan. ""Classrooms are small, you could really study. I know some staff that could help me. The people are close together, really friendly.""


Right now, Kwan doesn't know anyone at Rainier Beach who speaks Chinese."" Lots of children at Cleveland speak Chinese,"" said Gene Kwan. ""I want my children to learn more about Chinese. I am a taxpayer, I pay taxes every month. I bought a house near to the school so it would be convenient. The school District doesn't care.""


""I am not just trying to do this for me."" says Sonny Kwan. ""I am trying to do it for the whole community.""


Kwan is now seeking legal advice on his case.

Natural and chemical-free products are the concern of today, and medical products are no exception. More and more people are seeking to treat their illnesses through ""natural drugs"" without chemicals, and many of them have found the answer, Chinese herbal medicine.


According to Mr. Hen Sen Chin, a Chinese herbal specialist in Seattle for over 30 years, Chinese herbal medicine centers around the technique of ""looking on the outside to understand the inside."" He explained that the four facial characteristics and the tongue are monitors of one's physical condition. The nose is related to the lungs, the eyes to the liver, the lips to the stomach system, the tongue to the heart, which in turn is related to the blood vessels, and the ears to the kidney, which is related to the bones.


After looking at a person's complexion and the facial features mentioned above, herb doctors identify the spots of pain or trouble. They then consider the history of the pains as well as the severity and how it connects to other bodily disorders before prescribing herbs.


Herb prescriptions are often quite complex. Rather than use just a single herb or a few herbs to treat a disorder, Chinese herbal medicine uses compound herb prescriptions. Compound herb prescriptions may contain as many as 40 different kinds of herbs. This number seems less awesome when considering that there are over 1,000 different kinds of herbs to begin with.


With the growing popularity of herbs and the increase in importing costs, herbs can become costly. The average cost for herbs is $17.50 per package, with each package lasting two to three days.


Unlike Western medicine, the aim of Chinese herbal medicine isn't to relieve the symptoms, explained Professor Willard Jue, a retired professor from the School of Pharmacy at the University of Washington. Since his retirement, he has been studying Chinese herbal medicine for the past 10 years. From his studies, Professor Jue concluded that Chinese herbal medicine is concerned with removing dyscrasia, an abnormal condition of the body.


An example he gave was treatment of hayfever. Hayfever, which results from weak muscles that are unable to screen out the pollen, usually brings about a runny nose and watery eyes. Western medicine would try to relieve the symptoms chemically, while Chinese herbal medicine would work at strengthening the muscle to screen out the pollen by removing the dyscrasia which is causing the weak muscle.


Surprisingly, it's not just the Chinese who believe in ridding themselves of the source of the disorder rather than the symptoms alone. Mr. Kai Chiu Choy of Choy's Herbs commented that his customers are Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Caucasian and, of course, Chinese.


One Caucasian customer who picked up her herb medicine commented, ""It (Chinese herbal medicine) has worked for me. I trust it for a quick natural heal.""

""I have no interest in moving Skid Road to the International District,"" said Reverend Stephen Burger, executive director of the Union Gospel Mission, the organization which recently purchased the American Hotel as temporary housing for women and families. The purchase price was $400,000.


""For a period of three years,"" Burger said, ""we have been dealing with a real concern of Seattle's community, a need for short-term hotel housing for women and families on a short-term, limited-time basis. We are dealing with a number of people coming to Seattle, many who cannot find housing.""


The mission would also accommodate people who have owned but lost their homes and needed a temporary place to stay.


Burger stressed that the American Hotel would only be used for short-term housing, but admitted that because of Seattle's housing shortage, people could have problems finding permanent lodging and would have to stay longer but ""our purpose will be to try to get those people out to find housing.""


The basic criteria for selecting people, Burger said, is that ""they need a place to stay."" He stressed however, that we are not intending to bring a Skid Road operation to the district."" Those who are alcoholics and who have emotional or mental problems would not be a part of the group, Burger said, without clarifying how that would be determined.


""We don't think that it will be a bad thing for the community. It will hardly be noticed.""


The American Hotel is located at the corner of Sixth Ave. S. and S. King St. It is owned by Rainier Heat and Power and built in 1925; according to Shigeko Uno, property manager.


The Hotel currently houses low-income elderly. ""It's always been for transients, for sawmill and railroad people"" who needed temporary lodging in the off-seasons,"" Uno said. In recent years, she continued, those transients became permanent residents.


Burger estimated that 60 percent of the Hotel's residents are permanent residents and the rest are transients. Bob Santos, director of Inter*Im, an I.D. social service agency which advocates for the area's elderly residents, is concerned over the possible displacement. ""This is their home and we don't want them displaced,"" Santos said.


Burger said that displacement would be on an ""attrition basis."" The 40 percent who Burger estimates are transients would be replaced. ""We will basically attempt within a reasonable period to come up with one floor that is available to house women and families. I intend not to displace people unless we find people who are causing problems.""


But, he said, ""We also have to look at the financial side. I think it's conceivable we will have to raise rents. We have to be realistic. We will determine rents in relation to the cost of operating the hotel.""


The mixed program of emergency housing and present residents is totally incompatible with the residents' lifestyle, Santos said.


According to Burger, the Mission would take possession of the Hotel May 1 ""unless something happens. Either Rainier Heat and Power can't present a clear title, or we can't come up with the $100,000 to make the commitment.""


Burger also explained that the current manager has a lease through May, 1981. Unless the Mission and the Hotel's management can come to an agreement, he said, the Mission would not be able to take possession until May, 1981. The Union Gospel Mission is an independent local organization associated with the International Union of Gospel Missions, Burger explained. The governing board consists of 18 lay people from the Protestant churches of Seattle. The Mission currently manages four divisions, operated in different facilities: services for men, women, youth and young adult. ""We are following the Biblical mandate to serve the needy,"" involving guidance, food and shelter, Burger said.

Seattle has its share of garment factories, and the garment industry has its share of Asian workers. When something goes wrong in the garment industry, there's bound to be a buzz in the Asian community.


This article is not about your typical ""sweatshop"" story, where the selfish sewing factory owner hires non-English speaking immigrants to exploit for his own means, giving low pay and allowing poor conditions of long hours and closed windows to prevail. Though, I do not deny, in some places, these practices do exist.


Whatever the case may be, especially for the non-English speaking individual, these are jobs. Jobs in which the employer is willing to hire them despite their language ""disability."" Because of the language barrier these citizens face, they do not have a chance and are unable to compete for almost all of the work on the American job market. Most employers find speaking English synonymous with a worker's ability and even intelligence. Most Americans have this view.


For these factory employees, they're supporting their families, keeping them fed. They not only want the employment, but need it.


It's easy for the outsider to criticize the sad working conditions and to think that these women, perhaps, could learn English and obtain some skill to get a better job, if they wanted to. The reality is, when do they have time to go to school and learn English? Also, English is not an easy language to grasp when all your friends don't speak it either.


Have you ever operated an industrial sewing machine? Could you stand the noise? Look at your ski jacket, somebody put the stitches in it. These women who work in the so-called ""sweatshops"" have definite skills, not good-paying skills, but that's not their fault; it's the inability of the garment industry to pay its workers wages worthy of their labor.

Residents, volunteers, community activists and dignitaries gathered September 29 to celebrate the completion of the second phase of the International District community garden. Seattle Mayor Charles Royer planted a Chinese Pear tree as an estimated 150 people watched and applauded.


The idea of developing a cooperative community garden in the International District originated in 1974 to provide fresh produce for the I.D.'s elderly residents and to address their nutritional needs.


Darlyn Rundberg became the volunteer coordinator for the original project. With Ms. Rundberg's help, the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im), in March, 1975 obtained two lots from a local business person. The lots were initially leased to Inter*Im for three years at no cost.


Once the site was secured, Inter*Im wrote several grant proposals and received a small seed money grant of $2,626 to pay a project coordinator and to cover the cost of designing the garden. The design was completed with the assistance of landscape architecture students from the University of Washington.


Inter*Im then began a massive organizing effort around the construction of the garden. A volunteer work force of more than 180 persons was assembled to carry out the construction phase.


Because of soil, engineering studies pointing out the threat of slides, Inter*Im decided to terrace the hilly site. A French drainage system combined with a railroad tie retaining wall were used to develop the four terraces. Residents and volunteers from the larger Asian community came together to level the site, construct the retaining wall, and to haul in more than 700 yards of fill, gravel and manure. Summer Youth Corps workers and University of Washington design students assisted in constructing the wall and placing drainage system and irrigation pipe in each terrace. It then took a resident only three days to connect all of the piping.


Residents and volunteers were working weeknights and weekends in the middle of summer to turn the barren site into a productive garden.


The garden is entirely organic; no pesticides or herbicides are used. Through the use of natural fertilizers and interplanting techniques, as well as the use of mints, herbs and chrysanthemums to control pests, bountiful yields are produced without chemicals.


The first phase of the garden was completed in 1977 and contains 45 plots which are cultivated and harvested by residents. The garden became ""so successful,"" said Inter*Im Director Bob Santos, and the waiting list for more garden plots became longer, Inter*Im decided to look around for other land to expand the garden. In the early months of 1980, Inter*Im wrote a proposal to the federal government's Housing and Urban Development Office of Neighborhood Development requesting funds to develop additional garden plots and an orchard area consisting of fruit trees and berry bushes. At the same time, the agency was negotiating with the City of Seattle to lease land adjacent to the original garden.


By May, 1980, with funding and land leases and permits obtained, work began in earnest to construct four new terraces on city land located east of the first garden plots.


Again, volunteer labor, donated equipment and material helped in completing the new terraces ""ahead of schedule,"" Santos said.


For the past five weeks, project coordinator Sharon Hart said, a ""lot of people helped. About 25 volunteers showed up on one weekend. I was amazed."" According to Hart, plots on the lower two terraces have already been assigned to gardeners. ""People are planting right now,"" she said, such crops as onions, bok choy, lettuce, and spinach which are all winter crops. The upper two terraces will have a ""cover crop"" to improve the soil. ""In the Spring,"" Hart said, ""in March or the end of February, those two (upper terraces) will be ready for planting.""


Hart says there still are things to do. ""Next month we'll start planting fruit trees,"" she said, which would achieve the goal of ""producing a complete urban food production system for the community.""


Inter*Im also plans to construct two more terraces on the hillside to meet the demand for more garden plots, a solar greenhouse, benches, brick pathways, and handrailings for the residents.


The International District Community Gardeners ""are expert at a lot of things,"" Hart said. Jack Takayama is expert at planting and pruning fruit trees; Cappy Capistrano, is the in-house carpenter; and Leo Labree built the pig roast pit and the concrete terrace walls.


The beauty of the entire project, according to both Santos and Hart, is ""community involvement"" which turned ""an impossible situation"" into a success.

The construction of the International District's expanded garden is right on schedule. In fact, we may be ahead of it. The four basic, terraced walls actually go up very fast after the base or footings are set in place. These walls take an average of one week to build. Each wall has an average of 100 eight-foot railroad ties. The difficulty, so far, has been the construction of the bottom retaining wall which happens to be a series of intricately designed walls. These are built to the contour of the hill which nature did not create in a straight line.


We also are having the ever-present problem of drainage. You see, it does rain in Seattle and, along with the regular irrigation that will flow into the drainage system, is a very important factor for the retention of the hillside. Our designer is Darlyn Rundberg. We have a full-time crew of four persons who are hired to build the walls plus almost full time from Dan Rounds and me.


Two of the people, Ben Matsuoka and Scot Medbury, are work-study students. Ben is from the University of Washington; Scot from Evergreen. The two other crew members, Carlton McCreadie and Larry Runyer, were volunteers at Inter*Im in the past.


The 10 Summer Youth Corps workers were a great help. Throughout the summer their tasks included building compost bins, a cold frame, a new path to the old garden, digging trenches for the drainage and irrigation systems and hauling railroad ties and stockpiling them for the construction crew. These young people worked hard and played hard, but they earned their pay. After the walls are complete, which could be in two weeks if there is little or no rain, we will then start stockpiling sand and top soil. The fertilizer will be spread last. With luck this will be completed by the end of September.


Next spring, we'll be completing the last phase which will be construction of the mini terraces at Main Street for the fruit orchards. Volunteers will be recruited soon, so be prepared to slip into your boot shoes and be willing to savor the aroma of the thoroughbreds of Longacres.

In the International District-Chinatown, food is not the only thing that people come into the District to order, pick up, and take out. Prostitution continues to be an everyday occurrence in the area. It's an activity that community people have complained about for years. The police cannot eliminate prostitution from the District and the pimps and johns know it. The ladies are still on the street, although there are signs of its decline.


From the early 1900s to World War II, this area had a notorious reputation as a ""red light"" district, containing several brothels and gambling dens. Police officials conveniently looked the other way, often with 10s and 20s sticking out of their back pockets.


In the early 1960s, traffic jams were frequent in the early evening hours, created by potential johns and curiosity seekers gawking at the streetwalkers who lined Jackson Street by the old International Cafe at the corner of Maynard and Jackson.


Today prostitution is not as obvious to the casual observer. But shop owners complain when streetwalkers hang out in front of their shops. The shopowners feel that this discourages customers from coming into the shop. Women who work or shop in the District have been propositioned by overeager johns while waiting at bus stops or for a ride home. Residents have had their social security checks and rent money ripped off.


In the last several years, various people in the District have met with police officials about discouraging prostitution in the area. In response, the police have occasionally stepped up their foot patrols in the District. When the heat is on, the prostitution evaporates from the area. But when the heat dies down and the foot patrols become less frequent, the streetwalkers are back pounding the pavement. It's a cat and mouse game.


Because prostitution is so obvious, community people have blamed the police for ignoring the District. The police blame the legal system which, they say, ties their hands because the laws are too liberal. They could bust a streetwalker, but she could be out on the streets in 24 hours. Pimps are rarely caught, and the laws are not effective against the johns, the customers who pay for their play.


In recent years, prostitution becomes noticeable to the casual observer around the beginning of September. The canneries have closed and fresh money comes into the District in the pockets of cannery workers coming back to Seattle. The action picks up in the afternoon, particularly when the weather's nice. It'll die down again in November when the wallets are empty and the weather gets cold and rainy.


Donnie Chin of the International District Emergency Center estimates that approximately 10 to 12 ""regular"" prostitutes hang out in the District, mostly white teenage runaways, a far cry from the days when there were waiting lines on every street corner. ""Prostitutes were much bolder then,"" Chin recalls, ""because they would go out into the middle of the street to stop cars or openly ask guys with their wives waiting in line at a restaurant or at the movie theatre. The ladies today are a lot more casual -- they seem to be waiting to be asked.""


Prostitution is dropping off in the District. Chin said that this year he has noticed fewer men from outside the District than in years past driving in to pick up the ladies. ""Everybody knows that Pike Street is where the action is,"" he said.


Another reason for the drop-off is the redevelopment occurring in the District. New housing with tighter security is being built. Old buildings are being renovated. There are fewer places in the District where the prostitutes can bring their customers. The area has more street lights. And, as Chin says, ""There are less crazies around. It always seems to be that prostitutes and crazies hang out in the same places.""


Attitude is another reason for the dropoff. The attitude about the International District was much like the attitude about prostitution, ignore it and maybe it will go away. In the history of this city, the District was known for its gambling and brothels. Its activities were known to the city officials and police who tolerated the action. The District was a place where all of society's rejects lived -- the prostitutes, the gamblers, and yes, the Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese. It is only in the last five or six years that the District has received the respect and consideration from government officials that it has long deserved. The City now responds to concerns raised by community people. To cite an example, the District is to have two regular street patrol policemen.


Prostitution, like gambling, has gone underground in the District. As long as store owners are happy, as long as people who come to shop or work or live in the District are not harassed by overeager johns, and as long as residents are not ripped off, nobody complains. Chin said that it is getting to the point where prostitution is becoming a seasonal activity in the District, only noticeable in the summer and early fall.


Prostitution won't be eliminated from the District as long as there is a market for it. After all, prostitution is the oldest living profession. From time to time, the players may change, but the game remains the same.


The purpose of this editorial is not to talk about the merits of rent control but rather to criticize the methods used to present the issue to the public.

A national pool playing champion working in the International District?


Danny Louie, assistant manager at the China Gate Restaurant, feels that he is indeed a champion at his game.


Louie has competed in national pool tournaments, playing with professionals like Steve Mesrack (Wide World of Sports), Allen Hopkins, and Mike Segal. He has played many tournaments around Seattle.


Louie started playing at the age of 12, and has been playing for about 15 years. In the beginning he would practice four or five hours a day, and now plays once a week. ""It's hard to put a lot of time into it when you have a full-time job,"" Louie said.


""During the past nine years I've played many tournaments, local and national, I've covered about 70 percent of the United States, having played the U.S. Open in Chicago, the Sacramento Open, Florida Open, and the World Tournament in Oregon, where I won my favorite trophy.


""Pool is getting more publicity these days,"" Louis said, ""and in the next few years a pool player may be able to make a living on playing pool tournaments because of its increasing popularity.


""There are a variety of people who are interested and compete in the game. In proportion there are as many Asian pool players are there are Caucasian. Of course, it depends on the population and area you're in. If you're in San Francisco or Los Angeles you will find a great number of Asian pool players. The greatest concentration of pool players as far as quality are on the east coast, and range between 20 and 30 years of age.


""It's natural to feel nervous before a game, especially in a big tournament. I tell myself I am better than my opponent, and think on a positive level of psych myself out,"" Louie said. ""It takes a lot of concentration to analyze your shots four balls ahead. The basic knowledge of the game should be second nature by the time you reach the table, then you analyze and map out your strategy. An average game would last about four minutes. The longest game I can remember lasted 10 minutes. I once played a match with Mike Segal in Rochester, New York, which consisted of 42 games and last three hours and 45 minutes. However, an average match is usually eight out of 15 games.""


Louie is planning to compete in the Sacramento Open in June. In the meantime he will participate in local tournaments between Seattle and Oregon. He feels there is a possibility that after the next few years he may shoot pool for a living, but for now he will continue playing for as long as he finds pleasure in the game.

Funding and community awareness of Asian women's employment needs were stressed at a recent conference in the International District.


Approximately seventy Asian/Pacific women, community leaders, government officials and service providers participated in the first Pacific Northwest Asian/Pacific Women's Employment Needs Conference. The conference, sponsored by the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus, was held in late February at the International Terrace.


Gwen Wong, from the DOL's Women's Bureau, stated the Bureau advocates for conditions of women's roles in employment. She also stated that the bulk of Federal monies go to local agencies. People should look to state and local agencies for information, expertise, and money for projects on employment needs of Asian/Pacific women. Big monies are distributed to the state, county and cities which would be the prime sponsors, she said.


Wong said there is a need to encourage local, informal means of keeping in touch (linkages, friends and know how) to build a strong Asian/Pacific Women's Network nationwide. Wong announced that a similar conference was being held in New York at the same time and more conferences scheduled for Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu. Hopefully to develop a national report.


Dolores Sibonga, Seattle City Council member, said myths and stereotypes of Asian/Pacific women affect their employment opportunities and status. Sibonga said many Asian/Pacific women may not understand in detail their rights, rules and regulations on and off the job, but that there are many resources they can use for gaining information to prevent discrimination and to better understand the law. They can join groups such as the Asian/Pacific Women's Caucus and Department of Labor -- Women's Bureau. More Asians need to get involved in such groups and in government positions, she concluded.


Because of communication problems, many newly-arrived Asians are treated poorly and are sometimes put into the low or dead-end job positions, said Rachel Hidaka, from the Comprehensive Education and Training Act/English as a Second Language (CETA/ESL) Program at Seattle Central Community College. The CETA/ESL Program tackles this problem by providing jobs and English language skills, she said.


Non-CETA applicants, she added, also could get into the ESL Program through programs and grants now operating outside of CETA. There is a desperate need to expand these programs because the population is increasing and these types of programs are an on-going process.""


""Highly educated and highly skilled workers from Asian/Pacific countries may have a difficult time understanding the American ways,"" said Henry Takahashi, from Employment Security. ""The question is not who they are. It is the condition they come in. That is why it is crucial to reculturate and re-educate.""


Stella Ting-Toomey, of Communication Design, a research group, stated, ""There is a need for the 1980 Census to attempt to break down the Asian/Pacific population into distinct subgroups so that specific data on each Asian/Pacific Islander subgroup can be obtained.


""A need to coordinate efforts of local organizations, agencies, and communities and pool all information concerning the employment profile of Asian/Pacific women into one 'Asian Pacific Women's Employment Resource Center,' for effective information retrieval.


""Important employment variables in correlation with demographic characteristics on Asian/Pacific American women should be clearly identified so that comparative studies and analysis can be made between Asian/Pacific subgroups and with minority groups and the white population.""

Dignitaries and common people crowded into the International House January 17 to dedicate the International District's newest low-income housing project.


The International House is located on the corner of Maynard Avenue and Weller Street. The 99-unit senior citizen apartment complex was completed in September, 1979. The project is subsidized through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Section 8 Program. Security Pacific, Inc., is the developer.


U.S. Senator Warren G. Magnuson and Seattle Mayor Charles Royer were on hand for the dedication. Several King County and Seattle City Councilmembers and District community leaders also participated.


Wild applause preceded Inter*Im director Bob Santos' speech recalling the first organizing efforts for housing in the District.


Mayor Royer said tremendous strides have been made for more housing in the District and added that the need now is for market-rate housing, which is ""important for the economic health"" of neighborhoods such as the International District. ""We have a commitment from HUD"" for market-rate housing in the International District through the Neighborhood Strategy Area Program, he said.


Senator Magnuson said the community ""can depend on me to do the best I can"" in working to get more housing where it's needed, adding that federal budgetary restraints make it ""a difficult job.""


The International House will partially meet the housing needs of the International District's low-income elderly. The 99 units, together with the 96 units of the Imperial House, another recently-completed low-income housing project on Sixth and Main Streets, have brought a total of 300 new housing units for the District's low-income residents since 1973.

The chairperson of the Bumbershoot advisory commission earlier this month was selected coordinator of this year's Asian American Art Exhibit. Vera Ing, also Wing Luke Museum Board Vice-President, agreed to coordinate a repeat of the widely-acclaimed exhibit held at the Museum last June.


At the Wing Luke Museum Board meeting March 5, Board members reiterated support for the exhibit. Last year, the art exhibit was funded by the Seattle Arts Commission (SAC). The SAC generally does not fund the same project two years in a row under the category in which the Wing Luke receives its money. The Museum will use this year's SAC funding for a Chinese Folklife Exhibit, therefore, some other nonprofit community organization would have to sponsor the Asian American Exhibit and apply for SAC funds, Museum Director Peg Marshall suggested that Cicada be approached to be the sponsoring agency.


Earlier in the meeting, Ing read a letter to the Board which cited ""growing concern"" by those in the community that the Asian American Art Exhibit would not be held this year. The letter, addressed to the Board, was written by Gary Iwamoto. ""Young Asian American artists,"" Iwamoto said, ""need the availability of a Wing Luke Museum for the opportunity, for the encouragement to grow as artists and to expand their creativity."" He urged the Museum to support the exhibit as a matter of ""the highest priority.""


Ing said she has already established contact with a core of Asian American artists who would exhibit their art.


Last year the exhibit was held as a part of the International District Economic Association (IDEA) sponsored Summer Festival. Peg Marshall said, ""I was hoping to have the Folklife Exhibit through the summer so it could be there for the summer tourist traffic.""


Because of the funding schedule of the SAC, final approval of funds for the exhibit would not occur in time for the exhibit to begin in June.

""Don't bus our schools away"" was the message on a poster that hung in the Sharples Junior High School auditorium during a community meeting organized by SESCO (South End Seattle Community Organization) on June 30. Students, parents and community group members reaffirmed this message in their presentations before Seattle School District officials and called for measures to correct inequitable bussing.


""Paper desegregation"" was the phrase Bill Smith, a Franklin High student, used to rename the Seattle Plan. ""It (desegregation) looks good on brochures and paper but in reality the south end schools are used as a source of supply for other schools,"" explained Smith.


Jan Kumasaka, a parent from the Rainier Beach area, pointed out the differences between Roosevelt, a north end school and Rainier Beach, a south end school, related to inequitable bussing. Some contrasts included ten class periods of music at Roosevelt compared to two at Rainier Beach; and five foreign languages offered at Roosevelt compared to three at Rainier Beach.


Representing the neighborhood groups was Marie Wilson from Rainier Beach Community Club. Wilson commented that the south end community is accustomed to struggling and fighting to get their fair share.


""We've been patient, but our schools are being shortchanged,"" said Wilson.


After hearing other presentations by school representatives and community group members, the school district officials had a chance to respond.


According to Bob Nelson, acting school superintendent, the school district ""won't embark on any major changes for fall of 1980, but is attempting to tighten up on transfer guidelines.""


Jim Viers of SESCO said, ""We're trying to make the plan work. We're not an anti-bussing group -- we're just concerned about the impact on our neighborhood schools.""


This meeting marked the beginning of an extensive campaign by SESCO and south end residents. Circulation of petitions demanding an end to inequitable busing, speeches at the school board hearing including one on July 30 at A&S Center, and a possible letter writing campaign will continue throughout the summer and into the fall.


As Teresa Oh, chairperson of the Filipino Education Task Force and member of the Bilingual Committee, put it, ""As long as our demands aren't being met, we'll keep on talking to our school administrators. This is just the start.""


If you are interested in participating in the efforts to end inequitable busing or would like more information, call SESCO at 722-0075.

The Taiyo Athletic Club, under whose banner many Seattle Nisei sports teams competed in the 1920s and 1930s, celebrates its ""Golden Age Reunion"" July 19 at the Nisei Vet's Hall at 1212 S. King St. The club has been around 54 years, although inactive since 1941.


The Taiyo club grew out of an intense interest in the national pasttime of baseball during the early 1900s. For Japanese immigrants and their children, baseball and other sports became not only recreational but also social institutions.


In 1906, the first Japanese baseball team was established in Seattle. The Nippon Club was composed of young Issei men who toiled in canneries, restaurants and domestic service. Other teams, including the Mikado team and the Columbia Club from Tacoma started up at about the same time. By the 1920s thousands of young Nisei men and women played baseball, basketball and football in teams and leagues organized in the Japanese Community throughout the state.


""It kept the kids off the streets,"" said Yoshito Mizuta (who is handling publicity for this year's reunion), referring to the many athletic teams which sprung up in the 1920s in and around Seattle: Asahi, Mikado, Waseda, Lotus, White river, Auburn, Kent, Fife, Tacoma, Green Lake and Ginsei.


The Asahis became the strongest team and rivalry with the Mikados was intense in the second decade of the 20th Century. By 1924, the two clubs were united into the Nippon Athletic Club, taking the best players from both teams. In 1926, the Taivo Club was started accommodating the next best players in the community and the rivalry continued through the 1930s between teams from the Taiyo and Nippon Athletic Clubs. At its peak in the mid-1930s, the Taiyo Club had a roster of 120 members and fielded five baseball teams, three football teams and three basketball teams.


The club had a built-in farm system in which older Nisei coached the younger ones and the best athletes worked their way up to the senior team, according to Bill Hosokawa, who reminisced about ""the good old days"" in the Pacific Citizen.


This year, Mizuta said, the club members will give recognition to the Japanese American Courier and ""its founder and editor, James Y. Sakamoto and the hard working staff whose efforts contributed so much to the Northwest sports program."" Sakamoto's newspaper sponsored the Courier League which included baseball, basketball and football divisions. Sakamoto ""knew that most Nisei didn't have the physical size to compete on high school teams,"" Hosokawa said, ""and he saw the need for leagues of their own. So the paper sponsored them.""


""The leagues built up strong but wholesome rivalries, kept the kids off the streets, created teams instead of gangs, brought country teams into town and sent town teams into the country, and developed some fine friendships."" With the passing of years, interest in sports changed, and the Nisei took up other interests including golf and fishing. Only one Taiyo baseball team was entered in league competition in 1941.


World War II intervened and the west coast Japanese were evacuated inland. After the war, the teams were not started up again as the Japanese concentrated on surviving day to day.


Interest in the Taiyo Club was reactivated in 1960, when club members held their first reunion. Reunions have been held since at four-year intervals. ""We expect about 300 people this year,"" Mizuta said.

Several tenants of the Governors Apartments, located at the corner of 6th Ave. S. and Jackson Street, are complaining that the building owners' proposed rent increase is ""too high.""


Irwin and Bruce Yoshimura are the new owners of the off-white, two story structure with intricate trim as a result of a bidding held on June 27, taking over from Rainier Heat and Power.


The International District Housing Alliance, a housing advocate group, said eight tenants have come to them with complaints about the increase.


Bob Santos, Inter*Im director, said he had talked with the Yoshimuras about the increase. ""The rents aren't bad,"" he said, ""but in terms of percentages, it's a hell of a difference for the renters.""


Mr. and Mr. Jack Eng, tenants, said their rent is being raised from $75 to $135 and claims that their only source of income is social security of $417 a month. Ng King Quan, who is 80 years old and lives alone, said her rent is being increased from $100 to $145 a month.


The International Examiner talked to some tenants who said they were not complaining because they've experienced only a 20 percent increase in rent; however, they said they ""could not afford it if the rent was raised more.""


Owner Irwin Yoshimura says he is in a bind. The Yoshimuras purchased the building for $480,000 and ""we have got to go out and get a mortgage and finance the building while Rainier Heat and Power owned the building free and clear.""


The Governors Apartments is one of six buildings in the International District that was owned by William Chappell, who died in 1921. Chappell left the buildings in a trust under the name of Rainier Heat and Power with the requirement that the trust be dissolved and the buildings sold to the highest bidders by May, 1981, with the proceeds going to the heirs.


""They (Rainier Heat and Power) didn't raise rents on some of the people for a number of years,"" Yoshimura continued, explaining that while Mr. and Mrs. Eng's rent may be increased 80 percent, they have had only a $25 increase between 1963 and 1980. ""It looks bad for some people, but they've really been getting away with it dirt cheap for a lot of years.""


Rents for units, according to Yoshimura, will be determined by the rate per sq. ft. with higher rates per sq. ft. for renovated units and even higher rates for offices.


""We are trying to look out after them (the tenants),"" Yoshimura said. ""We have applied for Section-8 housing for moderate and low-income people"" in which the government would help subsidize the rent. ""But it takes time,"" he said.

King County has applied to the State Jail Commission for funds to construct a work-education-release (WER) facility on the same downtown site as the proposed new jail.


To ease overcrowding at existing downtown facilities, the County plans to develop a new jail between James and Terrace Streets. The County envisions possible joint use of security staff and convenient transfer of resources between the new jail and work-release facility.


The County Rehabilitative Services Department, in its final Environmental Impact Statement, describes construction of the new WER facility and conversion of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Building as the two desired alternatives for accommodating 300 inmates.


Bob Wagner, project manager in the County Architecture Division, said the application cited strong community opposition to conversion of the INS Building and many possible delays in clearing the way for use of the building. Before King County could utilize the INS Building, the federal General Services Administration (GSA) would have to surplus the building, ousting the Immigration and Naturalization Service to make the building available.


Wagner said the County hopes to get construction of the new WER facility underway by March 1, 1981. Conversion of the INS Building would be more cost-efficient than building a new facility, he said, but it faces time-consuming City Council and County Council approval and International District community opposition. He added that the GSA has not made the INS available.


Wagner pointed out that the County Council did not preclude the possibility of using the INS as a work-education-release facility if it later became available. ""But,"" he said, ""it would have to be the County Executive or the County Council that would make that decision, not me.""


In a letter to Executive John Spellman last month, representatives of the International District Economic Association. International Special Review District Board, International District Improvement Association and Chinese Associations Alliance reiterated opposition to ""either the temporary or permanent use of the INS Building for a WER or related program. We support the continued operation of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service operations at the site.""

The International Examiner has honored me greatly by inviting me to write some thoughts about my friend, Dr. Minoru Masuda, who died in Seattle on June 12.


I learned a lot from Min. He was a vital force in prodding our community conscience for fairness, justice, integrity, education, civil rights, respect for the aging and respect for youth.


Dr. Masuda and his wife, Hana, have been my friends for a number of years. When he died, an important part of my own life was taken away. Ours was not a particularly demonstrative friendship. We visited only occasionally, although our homes are only a few blocks apart. Somehow there was always an unspoken bond that tied us together. We agreed on so many things. We fought some of the same battles. We loved the same music. Our families were very important to us. We could always depend on each other.


When Min was hospitalized during his illness, my wife, Elie, and I felt strongly that Min and Hana needed to know how much we loved them. I was determined that nothing would prevent my regularly visiting Min in the hospital and visiting him and Hana when he was allowed to go home.


It was my great fortune that Min always welcomed me. Most of the time beautiful, intelligent, strong Hana was at the hospital comforting him. I would apologize for my intrusion, but I knew I could stay awhile. I would talk. I would listen. We would be silent. And this beautiful person, Min Masuda, would talk and smile and his eyes would sparkle. He was in the throes of a serious illness. Yet he never complained. We would talk of battles won and of things he felt still needed to be done.


I have not always been able to deal with sickness and death. From Min (and Hana) I gained much strength and a better understanding of the tenuousness of life. Despite Min's circumstances, there was never sadness. We spoke of the beauty of life, of good works done, and of the kind of future we all want for our families, our communities and our world. We even were able to laugh about some things.


I first met Min, I think, in connection with JACL (Japanese American Citizen League) activities. One of the things that impressed me most was that Min and Hana would attend meetings together. When Min was President of our local chapter, Hana seemed always to be there as co-host for the group. Min was a creative challenger. He was a fighter. He was a humanist. He had a strong sense of history and a strong sense of social justice. In whatever he did, he could draw strength from beautiful Hana, his wife of forty-one years.


I had long known Dr. Masuda from his reputation as a distinguished professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Washington. I was familiar with the acclaim he had earned in scientific and academic circles for his teaching, his research, his writings and his assistance to students.


I encountered Min in the late 60's when he was actively involved in developing the community school council concept. This culminated in election and establishment of the Central Area School Council, the revitalization of Central Area schools, desegregation and the first efforts towards utilizing minority persons at significant levels in the Seattle Public Schools.


With an impressive academic background (B.S. in Pharmacy, M.S. in Pharmacology and Ph. D. in Psychiology), this Seattle-born University of Washington scholar came through Bailey Gatzert Elementary School and Franklin High School. He was passionately devoted to quality education for all of our children in a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-racial atmosphere so much available in our city of Seattle.


Min Masuda plowed the fields of academia with his massive outpourings of learned treatises on scientific and cultural subjects. He found time to tutor students in the health sciences field, especially in the medical school. He won the prestigious Charles E. Odegaard Award from the Friends of EOP in April for his tireless efforts towards equal educational opportunity at the University of Washington.


He was awarded a Distinguished Community Service Award at the Golden Anniversary Dinner of the Seattle Urban League the same month in recognition of his lifetime of unselfish devotion to education and human rights for all persons in Seattle and throughout the world.


On August 1, Hana will be going to the Annual Convention of the National JACL in San Francisco to accept an award for Min as ""Japanese American of the Biennium"" in the field of Humanities and Education.


Min Masuda had a strong sense of patriotism, notwithstanding the hurt and humiliation he and Hana must have suffered, along with the 110,000 other Americans of Japanese ancestry who were placed in concentration camps amid the hysteria of World War II. The young marrieds, Hana and Min, were taken first to Camp Harmony in Puyallup and then to Camp Minidoka in Idaho in 1942. Min volunteered for the all-Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team and served with that most-decorated unit in Europe (he was awarded the Bronze Star in 1945).


Min was a warm and sensitive man, but he was no ""quiet American."" He was a fighter willing to do battle for what he believed in, such as fair treatment for all persons in our society, including compensation for victims of America's concentration camps.


Min was always active in community projects. He was instrumental in setting up the successful programs on ""Japanese America"" held this spring in Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane. He was an active participant in last fall's successful ""Day of Remembrance,"" the pilgrimage to Camp Harmony. He was involved in such activities as the Seattle Nikkei Retirement Coalition, Nisei Veterans Committee, Asian Counseling and Referral Service and Asian Americans for Political Action, as well as the JACL.


His abundant intelligence and social conscience reached across age, race, culture, religion and political philosophy. He was a source of inspiration to young and old. He challenged all of us to deeper commitment in improving the human condition.


I am among many who were touched by his great compassion, his manifest love, his active concern and his vital spirit.


I am glad that I took the time to tell Min Masuda how rich he had made my own life and how much I loved him. He was so modest that he insisted to the end that he had done nothing to deserve the awards that came his way nor the outpourings of affection from his friends.


But Minoru Masuda man of many talents and of abundant heart, will be remembered by all of his friends as one of those special persons who move across the earth touching the hearts and minds of others. He inspired us to more vigorous efforts towards solving the economic, scientific, political and purely human problems of the world.


We can demonstrate our love for Min Masuda by working harder for the causes to which he devoted his intelligence and energies and by extending that love to his wife, Hana, and to their children, Tina and Kiyoshi, and their granddaughter, Rika.

By April 1, 50 to 75 high-flying creatures will begin a two-year vigil over the International District. Mammoth dragons, insects, phoenixes and fishes will hang from the new Asian-Iantern light standards, a result of the Seattle Arts Commission's ""Flying Colors in Fabric"" decorative banner project.


Thirty-three-year-old professional artist Diana Aurigemma pulled the winning elements together in five designs to take the $500 first prize. The owner of High Flying Flags and Banners, and four-year veteran of the banner business, Aurigemma's aerial craftwork can also be seen in the Seattle Center House and at Longacres.


Thirteen amateur and professional artists competed for the first prize and the chance to see their handiwork displayed along Jackson, King, and Weller Streets between 6th and 8th Avenues, South in the February 1 contest at the Seattle Center.


Asian . . . and brightly colored entries dominated the competition. In addition to color drawings of proposed banner designs, artists were required to submit resumes, ten slides of past work, outlines of materials and construction methods, and estimated fabrication costs.


Practicality, banner theme, and overall quality and design were criteria for judging. Artist George Tsutakawa put it simply: ""We want something that works."" Tsutakawa, on a judging panel with interior designer Phyllis Lui and curator/author LeMar Harrington, said he was wary of designs that looked like ""Japanese bath towels,"" as well as ""cheap design."" Tsutakawa said all the judges preferred vivid colors ""you can see a block away,"" over pastels. A design that could be taken for a ""diaper flying in the wind"" was avoided, he said. The three judges also preferred ""clean"" (simple) designs.


Julia Laranang, Chinatown-International District Preservation Development Authority representative to an advisory committee which assisted in the judging, said universality of theme was an important factor in considering the banners. The designs should represent all ethnic groups, not just one or two, she said.


Aurigemma said she was ""surprised"" to learn the outcome of the design contest. It was the first banner contest she had won, she said, and to celebrate, she immediately treated friends to a lobster dinner.


Between 48 to 75 fabrications of Aurigemma's designs will be produced in color-fast, fade-resistant nylon sufficiently durable to last two years, at which time District merchants have the option of restoring the banners.


The Seattle Arts Commission budget includes $4,800 for fabrication costs, and a separate design award of $500, for a total budget of $5,300. The City will pay the installation costs.

The mixing of a 200-year-old technique of woodblock printing and a surrealistic, abstract style has earned Akira Kurosaki a title as one of Japan's leading contemporary artists. ""Not only is his work exciting and lively, he is one of very few artists today using the Ukiyo-e technique of woodblock printing,"" states Erica Williams, owner of the Erica Williams/Anne Johnson Gallery, which recently displayed his work.


Contemporary printmakers use more modern methods of printing such as silk-screening or lithography. However, Kurosaki was concerned that the traditional ways would be lost and began to learn the painstaking technique.


Each print calls for some nine to fifty-separate pigments plus a separate woodcut for each color used. The pigments are mixed with a little rice or wheat paste and are applied to the woodblock which is cut from a close-grained wood. A twist of hempen cord, called ""baren,"" is used to rub the back of damp paper over each woodcut. This process is repeated for each different color in the print and produces a special effect by the subtle blending of color and tones.


This method is used in Japan today; however, its use is primarily limited to reproducing the old prints which were originally done in this manner.


Although his technique is traditional, Kurosaki's style is strictly modern. Characteristic of his work are surrealistic images, geometric forms and flowing ribbons done in strikingly bright colors set against a sleek, black background.


Included in the recent exhibit was the ""China Series,"" a collection of prints inspired by his recent trip to Beijing. Kurosaki was one of several Japanese artists making the trip funded by the Japanese government, marking the opening of relations with the People's Republic of China.


His China Series combines the techniques of woodcut printing with gold and bronze-powder silkscreened detail and calligraphy. Among the series is the ""Temple of Heaven"" which the artist saw in a thunderstorm. A thunderbolt, silkscreened in gold, shoots through the blackened sky lighting up the temple below. Another popular piece is the ""Great Wall"" which is seen from a distance winding over sloping hills under moonlight. The series is done in a tighter style than his other works; however, the geometric forms and flashes of color reminiscent of his past style comes through in some of the prints such as ""Shanghai Abacus"" and ""Chinese Opera.""


According to Williams, ""The showing has been a magnificent success and very well-received."" She held the premiere showing in the States of Kurosaki's work back in 1972 and since that time his popularity has ""really taken off."" The Gallery has subsequently held several Kurosaki showings and his work has consistently been one of the gallery's biggest sellers.


Kurosaki was born in Manchuria in 1937. He graduated from Kyoto Technical University. He also studied at Harvard and at Hochscule fur Bildende Kunst in Hamburg and has taught at the University of Washington. He has exhibited worldwide, and his work is included in corporate and museum collections in Japan, the U.S., Australia and Europe.

Minority women seeking economic and social equality in the United States often find themselves caught in a catch-22, because the system within which they look for alternative job opportunities, equal pay and freedom of choice also perpetuates racial and sexual discrimination.


This was one issue discussed at the Minority Women and the Feminist Movement conference. The conference, partly sponsored by the Demonstration Project for Asian Americans, opened a dialogue on the double discrimination of racism and sexism confronting minority women and on their attitudes toward the feminist movement. About 60 women and a handful of men participated in the day-long session at Seattle University.


When women began to enter the work force in unprecedented numbers in the 1960s, the women's movement pushed ahead to secure equal ground in hiring pay and promotion.


""By the 1970s,"" said U.S. Labor Department's Lazelle Johnson, ""twelve million women had entered the labor force. Two million were minority females. Despite their numbers, they weren't any better off than they were in the 60s."" Women are still concentrated in a limited number of jobs, mostly in clerical and service areas.


Today, Johnson continued, for every dollar a man makes, a woman earns 59 cents. This means she must work nine days to earn what a man would earn in a normal five-day work week. This earning disparity affects not only women whose paychecks help supplement their men's incomes, but hurts deeply those single women and women with children who are the sole income earners in their household.


Racism and sexism in hiring and promotion often come as ""disguised excuses,"" said Johnson. Women who pursue non-traditional jobs such as construction and police work have often been denied employment because their male co-workers are ""not accustomed to working with females;"" or, minimum qualifications for a job may be upped to ""Masters degree in business, three years work experience"" to effectively screen out female and minority applicants.


Stereotypes based on a woman's sex and racial background are also used to categorize and discriminate. Maxine Chan, a feminist, said the stereotype of the self-effacing, passive female has often been attributed to Asian women in the garment industry. Because a majority of them are non-English speaking, she said, they do not interact with their co-workers and do not participate in union meetings. Without fair consideration to the language barrier, they are tagged ""passive and quiet"" by their co-workers and supervisors.


Within the family, women often find their ambitions curbed by traditional values. Bea Kiyohara, director of the Asian Exclusion Act, said, ""Today, even in third and fourth generation Asian families, the family goals are pinned on the male and his welfare take priority.""


Kiyohara said that women must recognize the ""mom-ism"" in themselves. Women, in part, are responsible for extending privileges to their sons. This pattern carries to other relations and in the eventual unbringing of their own children.


The position of minority women is a complex one and has not been enthusiastically embraced by white feminists. The added racial discrimination faced by minority women clouds the issue of sexism, which is of primary concern to the white women's movement.


Minority women have formed offshoot organizations, the Asian/Pacific Women's Caucus, the Black Women's Network, and Black Women's Caucus to deal with


They hesitate to join the white feminist groups because they recognize that equality must be secured for both minority men and women.

International food deliveries of 30,000 tons monthly are needed to avert famine in Cambodia, according to David Elder, an American Friends Service Committee official just back from that country.


""Food is the fundamental problem in Kampuchea (Cambodia) for 12 months, until the major harvest next November-December,"" said Elder, Coordinator of the Quaker organization's Southeast Asia Program. He spent nine days in Cambodia in December and two days in late November.


""With about 600 new trucks -- including 300 from the Soviet Union -- on the scene, all food, including from UNICEF/ICRC (United Nations Children's Fund/International Committee of the Red Cross) are being distributed to more regions than have been reached in the past,"" Elder said.


He added that ""Many of the civilians coming out from contested areas of Cambodia have been in an extremely emaciated condition. However, the great majority of the Cambodian people, while hungry, are not on the brink of starvation, although that could become a serious problem if supplies don't keep coming in.


""The primary sources of food for the Cambodians are their recent poor harvest which was 200,000-300,000 tons instead of the normal one and one-half million tons, food from Vietnam and the Soviet Union, and food from the UNICEF/ICRC 'Joint Commission,' along with OXFAM, AFSC, and other voluntary agencies.""


Elder, who walked freely and spoke with people through out the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh during his stay, said he observed AFSC supplies from a Thanksgiving weekend shipment in use at the January 7th Hospital. He also said he saw other relief aid which had been distributed in the city and in province towns and that Western sources told him of distributions in central Cambodia.


""Our 400 tons of rice given in early November via OXFAM seems to have been properly distributed,"" Elder said, adding that international contributions to date have been around 25,000 tons from UNICEF/ICRC and 8,000 tons via OXFAM.


He said that ""While major food aid from the Soviet Union and Vietnam had been widely distributed, it seemed that 80 - 90 percent of the UNICEF/ICRC food had not yet moved out of warehouses in Kompong Som, while 80 - 90 percent of the OXFAM food had been distributed, since most of it came to Phnom Penh. Some UNICEF/ICRC food shipped to Phnom Penh is being distributed."" Elder predicted that the warehouse stockpiles would be moved into distribution this month.


He said the Cambodian priorities for distribution appear to be: first, food in place of money for salaries for government employees, including those working in hospitals, schools, factories, or cleaning streets; second, the sick, the orphaned, and other needy persons, and finally, to the general populace.


He explained that distribution is hampered by an almost total lack of communication facilities -- no telephones, no mail service, no telegraph lines -- by bad roads and in many cases, in experienced personnel weakened by disease and malnutrition. ""It's clear that the government's policy is to move food out as rapid as possible, but it is hampered by all the problems the nation faces,"" Elder said.


He also visited the Thai-Cambodian border where he said AFSC food shipments are not needed, but there the AFSC plans to provide much-needed health and sanitation information in the Khmer language. The Quaker organization also is planning another airlift of canned meat, vegetable seeds, vitamins and medicines to Phnom Penh soon to arrive on January 15.


Elder said Cambodians he talked with felt the present Vietnamese-supported government of Heng Samrin is preferable to Pol Pot's ousted regime, but ""there definitely is an element of Khmer nationalism that wishes that circumstances would allow for an end to the Vietnamese presence."" He said he found no evidence of Vietnamese diverting supplies from the populace. On the contrary, they were providing rice, trucks, and personnel to help the Cambodians, he said.


The AFSC has sought since 1917 to put into practice the beliefs of the Religious Society of Friends (Ouakers). The AFSC holds fast to the Quaker testimonies of love, integrity, compassion, and simplicity.

California legislator to hold redress hearings


San Francisco, CA -- California Assemblyman Paul Bannai (R-Gardena) recently announced hearings for Assembly Joint Resolution 56 which he introduced in January in the California Assembly and Senate. The Bannai Resolution supports a bill to establish a Congressional commission to investigate the evacuation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.


""There has never been another time in American history,"" Bannai reflected, ""when citizens of this nation have been denied constitutionally guaranteed individual protections solely on the basis of ancestry.""


Bannai, who was interned at Manzanar and served with the acclaimed 442nd Regimental Combat Team, stated that ""in arbitrarily suspending seven of the ten articles of the Bill of Rights, the government ignored its own internal intelligence reports attesting to the exceptional loyalty demonstrated by Japanese Americans.""


The Joint Resolution seeks the support of California, the state from which the majority of Japanese Americans -- approximately 95,000 persons -- were evacuated.


Bannai summarized his resolution as ""a measure which declares the California Legislature's concern with such a complete denial of civil rights and its support for the creation of a commission charged with the responsibility of studying the legal and constitutional aspects of such actions.""


Pink Lady makes prime time


Pink Lady, the Japanese female singing duo, will be spotlighted with comedian Jeff Altman in a new NBC series, ""Pink Lady,"" premiering March 14 at 9 pm.


Mie, 21, and Kei, 22, who prefer not to divulge their surnames are among the biggest selling female recording artists in the world.


Very popular in their native Japan, the two have amassed 10 number one singles and have broken attendance records for concert appearances in Japan, gressing $20 million. The superstars became the first Japanese artists to have a record on the American charts with ""Kiss in the Dark"" in 1979.


The former students of the Yamaha School in Music in Japan learn their lines and songs phonetically because of their limited English.


""Pink Lady"" will be a variety show with musical guests, including Blondie, Cheap Trick, Teddy Pendergrass and Alice Cooper. There will be regular weekly attractions: a film spot showing Mie and Kei on various excursions around Los Angeles, saluting a different city in each segment, including Hollywood and New York and other attractions.


The lingering effects of the Camps


Many of the values and ideals Japanese American Sansei are raised with are the result of the World War II evacuation, according to Sheryl Watanabe, one of the speakers at a forum last month, ""Concentration Camps -- USA.""


The forum, sponsored by the Asian Student Association of the University of Washington, was held at the Ethnic Cultural Center ""to educate people about the struggles of the Japanese Americans"" and ""expose the conditions of the concentration camps,"" according to organizers.


Watanabe, speaking on the lingering effects of camps on Japanese American families, said her Nisei parents always wanted their children to be home at dinnertime. She did not realize this was something families could not do in camp, Watanabe said.


She said the plans of the Nisei to get a college education were interrupted by camp. As a child was rebellious, not understanding the stress her parents put on education: ""Our Nisei parents want us to take advantage of every educational opportunity because they didn't have the same opportunities,"" she said.


Karen Seriguchi, who coordinated a conference on Japanese American internment at Seattle Central Community College in January, said the Issei bore the brunt of the evacuation effects. They lost their esteem, lost their honor and were stripped of property, she said. Community leaders -- including newspaper editors, schoolteachers and church leaders -- were rounded up. ""The Issei could not speak for themselves then because they could not speak English and many cannot now because many of them are dead,"" she said.

Compiled by International District Emergency Center


Most days in the district go by without incident. But at times it can burst with senseless violence. The following was taken from IDEC files.


Medics at IDEC had gone through a fairly routine day and now the night had set in. The air was mild and calm. Medics were sitting around the communications room watching a movie on TV and monitoring the radios. We were hoping for a quiet night.


Then suddenly, fire department tones started coming out of the radios. The TV is turned off and medics keep quiet as the information is read across the air. A slight chill fills the air, as the address is only a few blocks down the street. Suddenly chairs are pushed to the side, boots are tied up, cabinets fly open and medical kits are grabbed.


Follow-up information is now coming across the radio as we run down the street dodging traffic and pedestrians. At that address, a man has been shot. Police are responding. As follow-up information is given, we have already arrived at the location. Something seems to be wrong, something doesn't feel right. Just then the screams of aid cars and medic units with their flashing red lights fill the street. Police cars are rushing in from either end of the street, and the area is filled with flashing lights and uniforms.


As we enter the address, old men look up from their pool game as if we had come from another world. They're all staring at us with blank expressions. It seemed like nothing had happened. The aid crews looked around and the police asked questions, getting no answers. Everything appeared quiet, so the paramedics and the police went back to their vehicles. They assumed this was a false alarm.


IDEC medics stayed behind because the atmosphere was strange. Something was wrong. Asians rarely call for help. When they do, it's usually serious. IDEC medics waited until everyone left the room except the old men playing pool. One of the men points and tells us where to go. We nod to him slightly but say nothing. Rushing out the door, we yell to the medics, ""Hold it up."" They look at us with doubt, but do not question us. After they come back, we swing open the door. The room is silent. Above our head is a small hole in the wall. Turning to the corner of the wall, we see a body lying on the floor. The IDEC medics call out to the medics and they come rushing in.


It appears that this had been a gambling den and everyone had cleared out everything from the room. The man on the floor was bleeding from the head and wasn't breathing. It had only been four or five minutes since the call came in. Medics start emergency medical treatment with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, drugs and medical equipment. From what we can tell, a person had shot into the area from high across the street. The bullet went through a door and a plasterboard wall and came to rest in the back of this man's head.


Police now fill the room with their blue uniforms and radios blaring away with information. Police rush over to the building across the street to look for the assailant. Medics continue to work on the man. Minutes pass.


Then a faint bleat comes across the Electro Cardiogram. His pulse begans to beat on his own, but he still doesn't breathe, so we breathe for him with our bag mask of oxygen. We ask the police to get a stretcher. We lift the man onto it and wheel him out to the aid car. A small number of people have filled the doorway to get a peak at what is happening. We could hear the crowd ask questions as we passed them: ""Did he have a heart attack?"" ""What happened?"" We pass them without giving them an answer.


As we put the man into the aid car, we can see the detectives driving up in their unmarked cars. The aid doors shut and a medic asks us, ""How did you know?"" We replied, ""They thought they would get into trouble if they told you, so they told us instead."" He replied with a smile and rushed away, turning on his siren to clear the street. IDEC medics start up the dark streets and wonder if the movie is still on.


The man later died in the hospital. He was 86. The person who shot him was never found. The shooting was ruled accidental.


The majority of violence occurs during the hot summer seasons when there are many non-residents in the area. Summer is a few weeks away.

Philip Gotanda, David Hwang, Robert Kikuchi-Yngoyo and Sammy Takimoto make up a musical group called Bamboo. Their music captures the spirit and struggle of the Asian American experience. ""We try to convey a way of life, the experience of being Asians in America by using the beat of jazz, country western, latin and folk,"" stated Kikuchi-Yngoyo.


The group recently performed in Vancouver, B.C. and Seattle. While here, they played at the Ethnic Cultural Theatre and the Wing Luke Museum.


Asian American Dream, a song written by Gotanda, takes a light look at the pressures of upward mobility and education:


Sometimes I think I should go


back to school,


Become a dentist and lie by


my pool,


Marry a pharmacist and learn-how


to ski,


Wait for a while and have a


bourgeoise baby.


Other songs were just pure music with an infusion of taiko and lion dance rhythm. Another Gotanda song, using a country western beat, described the contribution of his grandparents to this country in the early 1900's, from working on the railroads to farming and to internment in the concentration camps during the War.


Philip Gotanda and David Hwang are also playwrights. Gotanda will be producing one of his plays at Stanford in the upcoming months. David Hwang's play FOB has been chosen for the National Playwrights Conference in Connecticut and will open this spring at Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival in New York.


Sammy Takimoto and Robert Kikuchi-Yngoyo were formerly with Yokohama California, a musical group. Takimoto is also performing with the San Jose Taiko Group. Kikuchi-Yngoyo has performed in the past with the Asian American Theatre Workshop in San Francisco.


Bamboo was chosen as the name of the group because ""it's strong and also able to bend with the wind, therefore making it a great survivor,"" stated Takimoto.

""Well, do you recognize this?"" Governor Dixy Lee Ray handed me a slip stamped with a squared figure on it. I was somewhat unprepared for this inquiry when I walked into the Governor's office in Olympia October 15, 1979. I went there to conduct an interview with the Governor about her trip to China last September. She had led a state delegation of ten persons that spent two weeks traveling in the Orient.


She continued, ""I received this stamp in Shanghai as a souvenir from our Chinese host. This stamp says Governor Dixy Lee Ray in Chinese."" Using my expertise in Chinese, I said, ""Governor, the message from this stamp says Governor Ray only. The Chinese translation of your last name means thunder. It's a very powerful word indeed. When you read the Chinese character thunder, it sounds like Ray."" Governor Ray laughed and responded immediately, ""That suits me fine.""


We covered a great variety of subjects in the interview: missions to be accomplished by the state delegation to Peking, prospects of various exchange programs with China, Governor's full use of her Polaroid camera in the streets of Peking and Shanghai, the Chinese food, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, the unspeculated speculation of China in the year 2000.


I asked the Governor whether her China trip was initiated by an invitation from China's Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. ""That's correct,"" Governor Ray replied. ""When he was here visiting in the State of Washington, we had an opportunity to become acquainted. As a result, he did invite me to come with a few people from the state, so I was very happy to accept. We wanted to go last Spring, but with the legislature in session clear into June, we were advised that it might be better to wait until Fall after their hot season was over, and it was very warm still in Shanghai, so I was glad we took his advice.""


The Governor's delegation was hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries which made the travel arrangements for the delegation to stay in China for ten days. Governor Ray commented, ""Things went, I must say, very, very smoothly. We were most warmly greeted ... and we can't say enough in praise of our hosts.""


The Governor said Washington State is in a good position to promote trade with and to provide technical assistance to China. She mentioned that geographically, Washington State, besides Alaska, is the closest state to China. Therefore, it is very economical to use Puget Sound posts for transportation of goods between the United States and China. Also, the long existing historic, artistic and cultural ties between our region and China makes it easy to ""reestablish something which has been a happy relationship in the past,"" she said.


Ray cited specific examples of areas in which Washington State can provide technical assistance to China and in which the Chinese government is greatly interested: reforestation, greenhouse development of seedlings, aluminum industries, hydroelectric development and the liquidization of coal for producing electricity.


I mentioned talking with Mayor Charles Royer about promoting a sister city project with China and receiving a positive response from the Mayor. Governor Ray encouraged such an idea by saying that these people to people contacts are always valuable. To suggest another way that people to people contacts can be established, the Governor described the ""friendship force"" program initiated by President Jimmy Carter. Governor Ray discussed cultural exchange, commenting first on the sports and performing arts she saw in China. ""Acrobatic displays were astonishing and marvelous,"" she said. ""Peking operas were enjoyable but very difficult to understand. The young people at the children's palace are being well trained in dance, art and music, etc.""


Then she said with great emphasis, ""You remember what a tremendous appeal the King Tut exhibit had in Seattle? Well, when you think about some of the new tombs that are being opened up, think what an enormous impact that would make. It could draw a tremendous interest in China as well as being economically very beneficial.""


I next asked Governor Ray for her impression of Deng Xiaoping as a person and a leader of China. Without hesitation, the Governor expressed, ""I find him very impressive. He is quick, he is intelligent and he is very pragmatic. I think he is the kind of person that truly has the best interest of all the people at heart. He knows from his own activities and his own travels, he knows what must be done. He knows that you can't accomplish miracles; that when you undertake a very big and complex project, it has to be done step by step and he knows how important to put the basic things first. I think he is really one of the world's great leaders at the present time. I think that he has the support and loyalty of the people around him and as far as I could tell, the great numbers of people in China who agree with his proposals as to how they can begin to build an industrial base and a strong modern nation. So I look for great things to happen.""


Concluding the interview, I asked, ""What would you expect to happen to China, say twenty years from now?"" The Governor said, ""Well, it's always dangerous to speculate and prophesize, but I would expect in 20 years that we would see many significant changes, because historically, the Chinese people have always been very determined and hard working and once setting goals, are really very effective and very efficient in achieving these goals. We know from the overseas Chinese that, wherever in the world the people of Chinese origin lived, they have become very successful business people. It took about 20 years for Japan to rise out of the ashes of war and be a modern nation. I think China will too, coming from a different background.""

Two recently released motion pictures, The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, and Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen, have brought back to life two of the most negative Asian stereotypes made popular by Hollywood.


For many Asian Americans, Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan represent symbols of an era in American history when Asians were discriminated in all sectors of society. The motion picture industry has played an important role in shaping and reflecting the images and values by which we view our society. Movies took us to different lands, to different times, introducing the moviegoer to people he or she would never get a chance to meet.


To most moviegoers, Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan were the only Asian people visible in society: Unless they mixed with Asian people, Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan were the role models by which the American public could judge Asian people. As always played by white actors like Sidney Toler or Werner Oland, Charlie Chan was given fortune cookie logic, exaggerated slanted eyebrows, and a phony accent which the public identified Chinese people with. In contrast, Chan's sons were played by ""real"" Chinese actors like Victor Sen Yung who bumbled their way into trouble to be rescued by ""gee, pop."" Even though the sons spoke perfect English, their function in these movies was to provide comedy relief so that the audience could laugh at them.


Over the last fifteen years, Asian Americans have protested against the negative stereotyping of Asians. The changes have been evident. Forty years ago, Asian actors were invisible on the silver screen unless the movie took place during World War II or in the Far East. Today, Asians can be seen in the movies and on television in a variety of roles in a variety of situations. Fictional characters such as the late Jack Soo's Sargeant Yemana (Barney Miller) and Robert Ito's medical examiner (Quincy) are a sharp contrast to the ""inscrutable Charlie Chan"", and the ""fiendish"" Fu Manchu.


The latest Charlie Chan movie has been met with a barrage of protests by Asian American groups. The protest was strong enough to halt production of the movie in San Francisco's Chinatown, forcing the film crew to change the filming to Los Angeles. One of the Asian protesters was James Hong, an actor who once played one of Charlie Chan's sons.


In response to this protest, Jerry Sherlock, the producer of Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen was quoted as saying, ""I can't really understand what the fuss is all about. Peter Ustinov portrays Charlie Chan in a terrifically upbeat way. The protesters say that Chan is a typical Asian American. That's like saying Kojak was typically Greek and Columbo a typical Italian.""


When faced with the protests of minority groups over what they consider negative stereotyping, the producers of such targeted films dismiss these protests as an interference with their artistic creativity. Others attack such protests as outright censorship of their ideas, and the way they wish their ideas presented.


In such cases, the First Amendment's freedom of speech clause is always cited by the producer. But the First Amendment also ""protects"" protests made by the minority groups. As much as the First Amendment permits a movie maker to make whatever film he or she wants (even if it's pornography), it also permits minority groups their First Amendment right to protest the way they see they are being shown by that movie maker.


Also, it's hard to see in the Charlie Chan movie how artistic creativity could be used as an excuse to bring back a stereotype that should have been buried in the past where it belongs. The other movie, The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, has received poor reviews from almost all movie critics. Critics have said that it's a shame that the Fu Manchu film will be remembered as Peter Sellers' last movie, given the actor's past accomplishments. The movie is hardly an artistic creation.


The same will probably apply to the Charlie Chan movie. Peter Ustinov is a noted actor who has won many acting awards. It does not take much artistic creativity for an actor of Ustinov's range and skill to play a cartoon character like Charlie Chan. It's a shame that noted actors like Sellers and Ustinov make fools of themselves. It's an outrage when they do it at our expense. These two movies are like bad ethnic jokes that fall flat.

In what pollsters predicted would be a close presidential election, Ronald Reagan rode the Republican tidal wave from coast to coast, leaving Jimmy Carter and many Democratic colleagues drowning in its wake. Locally, not all the Democrats went down with the ship. Some comments about particular political races where local Asians organized behind candidates or issues.


President


Asians organized support for Jimmy Carter. There weren't similar Asian groups for either Ronald Reagan or John Anderson, the Independent Party candidate. As everybody knows, Reagan captured more than a majority of the votes, outpolling a combined total for Carter and Anderson.


For minority people, a Reagan presidency sounds downright depressing. During his debate with Carter, Reagan said that when he was growing up, he wasn't aware of racism existing in this country. He has proposed to do away with the minimum wage in his assumption that the minimum wage law is preventing employers from hiring Black youth (the group with the highest unemployment). He intends to cut the budget in order to curb inflation. At the same time, he will increase spending for defense. This means that cuts will be made in other areas like delivery of social services or public employment. Reagan didn't exactly go out of his way to court the minority vote. But he didn't need it. Reagan does not have a strong civil rights record.


Carter tried to make an issue of Reagan's foreign policy. One thing is certain, forget the human rights policy. When Reagan was elected, Taiwan and South Korea were enthusiastic. It's clear that the voters were willing to ignore Reagan's trigger-happy image.


It's hard to predict what Reagan's civil rights record will be. Many folks thought Lyndon Johnson was a racist before he got to the White House, but the Johnson Administration was noted for the passage of many civil rights laws. Of course, Johnson was also president during the Watts, Detroit, and Newark race riots. Reagan will have to deal with minority people. The question is how.


Senate


The Asian community sponsored fundraisers for Senator Warren Magnuson. Maggie has been a dedicated supporter of projects in the International District and was influential in getting funds for social services and housing in our community.


Maggie was caught in the Republican tidal wave as he was beaten convincingly by Slade Gorton, Gorton was apparently very successful in casting Magnuson in the role of a big spender responsible for the inflation cutting holes in the wallets of American taxpayers.


Gorton plans to fulfill his pledge to cut inflation. He is trying to land a spot on the Senate Finance Committee. He has a reputation as a good nuts and bolts legislator.


Magnuson was the senior senator in Congress, having served 44 years. He did a lot for the state. He also was a good friend to the International District. It will be doubtful Gorton can or will do as much. Gorton was another who did not have to depend on the minority vote.


House of Representatives


There were many Asian American supporters for Mike Lowry, the Democratic incumbent congressman in Washington State's Seventh Congressional District. In contrast, Ron Dunlap, the Republican, went virtually unnoticed if not invisible in the minority communities. Bucking the trend that hit hard elsewhere, the liberal Lowry defeated the would-be inflationary fighter Dunlap.


Lowry supported many Asian American concerns. If folks can remember, Lowry sponsored a bill authorizing direct payments for Japanese Americans interned in World War II camps. Lowry has shown his concern for badly needed housing in the International District and has kept in contact with people in the community.


Governor


Many Asian American political activists will never forgive John Spellman's decision to put the Kingdome close to the International District. The wounds have not healed. There was an organized Asian groups supporting his opponent, Democratic candidate Jim McDermott.


This race featured a typical 1980 choice: the liberal, socially conscious Democrat vs. the fiscal conservative Republican. Campaigning as an inflation fighter, Spellman accused his opponent of being a big spender, of raising taxes, and of inflationary policies. Spellman alleged that McDermott would institute a state income tax, a no-no in this election year. His slogans said, ""Spellman is the answer, McDermott is the question."" But what was the question?


Spellman's affirmative action record has been described as adequate. Despite the criticism of Governor Dixy Lee Ray's administration, she appointed Asians to head state agencies, something no other governor, including Dan Evans, did in this state. Spellman did have Asians in mid-level positions while he was King County Executive. Another important factor to consider is that the King County Executive position is now vacant. King County is now homebase for this state's Asian population. Whoever takes the job will hopefully have some sensitivity to Asian American concerns. Incidentally, Spellman, like McDermott and Ray, is on record as supporting redress for Japanese Americans.


Rent Control (Initiative 24)


Several Asian community organizations campaigned and raised funds to support Initiative 24, the rent control issue. The anti-rent control forces, spearheaded by the Washington Coalition for Affordable Housing, raised over $800,000 and spent a record $500,000 to defeat the rent control initiative. In contrast, the pro-rent control forces, coordinated by Renters and Owners Organized for Fairness (ROOF) raised $50,000. Although the anti-rent control group used some questionable advertising tactics (advertisements that gubernatorial candidate McDermott was against rent control when McDermott hadn't taken a position), its message came clear to the voters, ""Build more housing, not more bureaucracy."" In a mood set by Ronald Reagan's promise to get government off the people's back, Seattle voters said ""no"" to rent control by a two to one margin.


It was a frustrating situation. By 5 pm on election day, a full three hours before the polls closed, the networks declared Reagan the winner. By 6:30 pm, Carter conceded. For people here intending to vote in the evening, those announcements were hardly an incentive to vote. It's like knowing how the story ends without reading the story. And it's a slap in the face of west coast voters because of the implication that west coast voters didn't count. Not that it mattered to Carter. But for the Democrats who lost, maybe it made a difference. It's hard to say.


So much for the winners and losers. What's it all mean? For one thing, the Republicans will be blamed for all the problems we will encounter in the 1980s. American is more concerned about its pocketbook than about its poor, sick and disadvantaged. And we won't have Billy Carter to kick around anymore.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A special $3.3. million housing grant was awarded recently to Puget Sound Council of Governments by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Congressman Mike Lowry announced.


About 500 new housing units are expected to be made available, most of them in King County, as a result of the nationwide competitive grant award, Congressman Lowry said. Part of the funds are earmarked for community development and housing planning.


HUD's bonus grant to PSCOG, which supplements the regular federal housing and community development program, include $2,543,000 in Section 8 funds to provide rental assistance for low-income families, elderly and handicapped individuals. This will be distributed according to a formula, based on housing needs, which provides 30 percent to Seattle, 4.8 percent to Bellevue, 25 percent outside King County, and the remainder to other local jurisdictions in Kitsap, Snohomish and Pierce Counties.


""We estimate that the $2.5 million in rent assistance will result in the construction of about 150 new family units in Seattle, 24 in Bellevue, and 125 in the rest of the county,"" Lowry said. However, the number of low-income families or elderly individuals who are in need of better housing has been estimated at 38,000 in Seattle, 6,000 in Bellevue, and 30,000 in the rest of King County.


""Clearly, we must do more to provide adequate housing for our residents who are most in need. And this does not even count the number of people who are being squeezed by housing costs, though less severely, or the relatively fortunate people who would like to buy a home but can't find suitable financing.""

Elder Chinese, Japanese and Filipino residents of the I.D. joined members of the Korean, Samoan and Indo-Chinese communities at the July 29 White House Conference on Aging Community Forum. Elderly concerns taken up were health care, housing, nutrition, social and legal services and retirement (income benefits). Recommendations were drafted to be presented to the White House Conference in December of 1981.


The gathering held at the International Terrace was sponsored by the Pacific/Asian Resource Center, Inter*Im, International District Housing Alliance, Asian Counseling & Referral Service, Chinese Information & Service Center and the I.D. Community Health Center.


Here were the Housing and Health Care Resolutions passed:


HOUSING


1. The federal government should provide housing for the elderly (who have fixed incomes) both through private and public housing and so the federal budget should not be cutback in the 1980's.


2. In the International District, with regards to empty buildings, the government should provide for more funding to renovate these old buildings for low-income housing rather than demolish them.


3. The City Council should support Initiative 24 which is designed to conserve existing inhabited housing.


4. The City should develop a tax on hotels and motels to create a fund for low-income housing as a creative alternative funding source.


5. More economic assistance should be given to the elderly who either own or rent their own homes, e.g., heating bill subsidies.


6. All housing recommendations should serve all Pacific/Asian elderly, not just one ethnic group.


1. Implementation of health centers that are community-based and with local control but funded at the federal level with block grant funding. (This would be similar to the Dellums Health Service Act.)


2. Integration, not segregation, of health care by age.


3. Health services should be holistic in approach, including: annual check-up, mental health services, bilingual/bicultural outreach, physical fitness and therapy, community health education, and nutrition.


4. Funding should be developed for research into native healing techniques of each culture and other health care needs of minority elderly.


5. Funding for a continuum of services for elderly depending on a person's condition and family support, such as bilingual/bicultural day care.


6. Development of self-help/self-improvement/self-enhancement programs in education, etc.

""They are just pacifying us,"" said Mako Nakagawa about Sears Roebuck and Co.'s recent removal of the ""Iwo Jima Battle Set"" from the market. Nakagawa belongs to the group of Asian concerned citizens who confronted Sears officials for selling the toys that ""nagatively stereotype, defame and derogate the Japanese and other Asian peoples in the feared and hated 'Yellow Peril.'""


Victoria Slind-Flor described the toy in a letter sent to the Beacon Hill Times: ""The U.S. Army soldiers are made from dark green plastic,"" she said. ""And the Japanese forces are made up in a sickening mustard color. Their faces all have slanted eyes, and there are several ones with buck teeth and crazed snarling expressions.""


Clifford Uyeda, National Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) President, wrote to Sears: ""Japanese Americans are outraged by the gross racial stereotypes portrayed in these toys. Impressionable children are subtly taught to degrade a race of people. Adults are reminded to recall all the ugly sentiments of race hatred. In America these are irresponsible and deplorable acts.""


The toy, manufactured by Marx Toy Co. and sold by Sears during the Christmas season, has since been pulled off shelves of all Sears stores throughout the country. William Casterline, Sears' Public Affairs Director for the Pacific Northwest, said the toy ""has been removed from sale nationwide by Sears and eliminated from any future marketing plan."" However, Casterline said ""he could not respond"" to whether Sears would meet the group's other demands. The original demands were that Sears:


-- Publicly apologize to the Asian communities and admit Sears' oversight and insensitivity in full page ads in major newspapers across the nation;


-- Inform Marx Toy Company of the racist nature of the Iwo Jima toy set and refrain from future consumption of said and or similar toys;


-- Donate all the proceeds from in-store and catalog sales of Iwo Jima toy sets to the Cambodian relief fund.


-- Withdraw all Iwo Jima toy sets from all Sears catalogs and stores.


""The least Sears could do is respond to the demands,"" Nakagawa said. ""They owe us that. I'm kind of disappointed it takes so damn long,"" she said, for Sears to respond to a ""very serious, racial thing.""


""They are just pacifying us,"" she said. ""There's no real understanding"" on their part, she continued. ""We live in a country where money talks. If Sears is sincere, they would donate money to the Cambodian Relief Fund. That would seem more sincere to me."" Nakagawa said she will get back in touch with Casterline regarding the demands. ""I will wait to see what Casterline has to say,"" she said.


Nakagawa also hopes the Japanese American Citizens League will continue its involvement in the issue and ""that there would be some follow up,"" she said.


Chuck Kato, co-president of Seattle Chapter of JACL said he would support and that JACL will probably pursue any action the group wants in gaining the other demands, ""but I don't know if it will come about,"" he said. ""The demands are legitimate but I'm pessimistic about the response from Sears.""


According to Casterline, the toys are sealed up and ""directions would come from inventory control people for disposition."" Casterline does not foresee the toys ""being distributed to discount stores"" to regain some of Sears ""substantial corporate loss"" as a result of pulling the toys off the market.

What building in the International District is the tallest with a great view? Hint: It's seven stories tall and is sturdy enough for four more floors, as originally planned. Answer: The Bush Hotel. Along with a great view and a strong roof, plants and vegetables soon may be harvested on it.


The International District Public Authority and Inter*Im have written proposals for a garden/greenhouse on the historic hotel's rooftop. They are seeking funding from the City's Department of Community Development (DCD) -- with the proposal initially reviewed by the Neighborhood Technology Coalition -- and the U.S. Department of Energy's Small Grants Program.


If funded, the project would be the first for Seattle and the northwest. Similar projects exist in Chicago and Montreal.


Plans are for the gardening area to have a wooden deck for drainage and protection of the roof, planter boxes and all-weather ""cold frame"" boxes, and a greenhouse where plant sprouts are nurtured until ready for transplanting. The hotel roof has numerous vents which the greenhouse could tie into for a heat source. There are also plans for a three-box compost bin which would turn organic garbage (from the hotel) to fertilizer. There also are plans for a sitting area with benches and chairs for the hotel's tenants.


""The project is unique, people haven't used rooftops that way,"" said Jaime Godshall, DCD work-study worker assisting the project development. ""Rooftop gardens have been a personal thing,"" she said. ""But this one at the Bush is a good way to involve the community, in fact a way to bring any neighborhood out of isolation and into being again.""


The hotel's mainly elderly tenants would primarily benefit from the project. ""There's a lot of old-timers here (in the Bush) who know about gardening,"" said Leo LaBree, long-time Bush resident. LaBree has been active in the successful Inter*Im community garden project and the Bush tenant group formed to support the project.


LaBree said the rooftop project was ""Wonderful! Anybody with a lick o' sense, with the price of vegetables these days, will be for it!


""And it doesn't take much skill, only a few basics to learn about gardening.


""You don't have to be very spry, just a few steps (from the Hotel's sixth floor) and you're up there. And there's an awful lot of room on the roof,"" he added. ""Seattle's a regular paradise and has a long growing season. There's hundreds of local vegetables that can be grown!""


During the end of a tenant meeting discussing the project's status, one tenant playfully jibed another, ""You don't know how to garden!""


""I know!"" shot back the old-timer, ""But I want to learn!""


For more information or if readers would like to support the roof-top garden and greenhouse project, call John Foz, Community Center Coordinator at the Bush 624-8929, or write ""BUSH ROOFTOP GARDEN & GREENHOUSE PROJECT,"" P.O. Box 3302, Seattle, WA 98144.

Noses turned away and breaths were held this summer to avoid the smell of rotting garbage from the alleys in the International District. The odor and garbage causing unpleasantness and health hazards continues, much to the annoyance of International District frequenters.


The smell is from the garbage dumpsters which are private and contracted for by property owners. Since the owners pay for the rental fees and collection costs, it is up to their discretion as to the number of dumpsters and the frequency of collection. At Seattle Disposal, one yard dumpsters currently run $3.30 per month for rental and $6.45 per pickup with a minimum service of one pickup per week. The cost per month with just one pickup per week totals $30 approximately.


However, some of the garbage ends up outside of the trash receptacles. For this, there are two answers. One is the Litter Ordinance which prohibits littering in public or private places. Violators can be penalized. A judge can order a monetary fine or time in jail.


The other answer is the City's Street Maintenance Department which cleans the alleys.


""We sweep and/or flush all improved alleys,"" said Herb Allwine, engineering specialist from Street Maintenance. ""By improved, it basically means that they're paved--say with concrete or asphalt.""


(Paving alleys is the responsibility of the property owners.)


For paved alleys, the Street Maintenance Department has a can man who goes around the International District and surrounding area with a can and picks up bottles and does some general cleaning in the alleys. He tries to sweep each alley daily but when he can't finish all of them, he cleans them on a priority basis. Alleys are cleaned at least three or four times per week.


A mechanical sweeper is used on an asneeded basis upon the can man's suggestion.


Flushing, another cleaning method, is hardly done. According to Allwine, ""Flushing isn't very practical due to the doorways and stairwells in the alleys which results in water in the buildings.""


When the condition of the alleys becomes detrimental to health, the Health Department get involved. Wally Swafford from the Environmental Health Service Department gave the appearance of rats as an example. In that case, the Health Department would contact the building owners and require them to bait the rats in order to control the infestation, possibly supplying temporary aid such as rat poisoning.


Inspectors from the Health, Solid Waste Utility and Street Use Departments occasionally check the alleys. The Health Department inspects the alleys on a regular basis for restaurants as a part of the routine checkup. But, according to Jim Coover, a Street Use inspector, the inspectors from the other departments go out to the alleys only on a complaint basis; at which time, they make a personal visit to the property owners and attempt to solve the problem.


The situation of littered alleys will continue unless there's collaboration. As Maureen Sullivan from the Office of Citizen Participation of the Engineering Department put it, ""It needs to be a joint effort with businessmen, the city, tourists and residents in order to keep the alleys clean.""

Asian American Studies programs, like other programs on college campuses, have hit hard times, said West Coast program directors who met November 6, 7 and 8 at the University of Washington.


The directors and other scholars were among about 300 participants in the first national conference of the Association for Asian Pacific American Studies.


While small non-major programs with steady enrollment have developed at most campuses, the directors said, most programs and faculty lack security and political pull. Without these, they said, the programs are vulnerable to administrative action.


""We're still struggling to establish permanency,"" said. Francis Ho, from the Washington State University. Ho, who is the Asian American Studies program's third acting director in three years, said the program's funding allotment was ""virtually zero"" when it was created three years ago and it receives variable money from the dean's office.


""Severe cutbacks at Washington State,"" Ho said, ""set the program's essence as a primary target. We're marked for partial support next year and are therefore subject to total elimination.""


Raymond Lou, Asian American Studies head at San Jose State, said his program faced similar threats.


Of the 21 or 22 programs at San Jose, Lou said, Asian American Studies is the smallest. He said that the program's survival depends on enrollment, which has never thrived.


""In our heyday, we had 200 students,"" Lou said.


Tetsuden Kashima, Asian American Studies head at the University of Washington, said the non-tenured status of the department's three faculty members could have"" disastrous consequences.""


The lack of tenure, Kashima said, prevents faculty from sitting on important university committees. ""It's easier to make your voice known if you're a tenured person,"" he said.


""Prospects are looking a little bit bleak for the UW,"" Kashima said. He noted that University President William Gerberding warned the campus community of a possible 12 percent budget cut and the elimination of 1,000 faculty members in 1981.


""The real possibility exists,"" Kashima said, ""for all non-tenured faculty to have their positions not renewed for next year.""


Kashima said the program will seek a replacement for faculty lecturer Peter Bacho, who will leave the program to practice law after summer quarter, 1981. Arts and Sciences Dean Ernest Henley, however, has put a freeze on hiring for vacant faculty positions.


""Ours is a particular budget situation that all of the University's programs, departments and schools will be facing,"" Kashima said. ""It would be unwise to expect receptivity to Asian American Studies in light of the situation.""


Kashima said that the program has received support from some campus administrators. But newer disciplines like Asian American Studies, he said, are probably the most vulnerable areas.


Kashima said that decision-making power is outside Asian American Studies' hands. Others, however, suggested that the association act on two ""crises"" in the field.


Franklin Odo, Asian American Studies head at the University of Hawaii, and Ling-chi Wang, director of the University of California-Berkeley program, are fighting individual battles for tenure at their universities.


Wang, denied tenure last year, is up for review again this year. Odo, who was lured to Hawaii by a promise that he would be considered for tenure, was denied tenure this year on a technicality. Odo had been scheduled to speak at the conference but was kept home by the situation in Hawaii.


""What's happening in Hawaii infuriates me,"" a conference participant said. ""It will mean the death of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii.""


Ron Takaki, former head at the University of California-Berkeley, agreed. ""In effect, Franklin's case spells death for Asian American Studies programs.""


The decision not to grant Odo tenure, Takaki said, reflects the low priority given ethnic studies programs.


Takaki urged the association to pass a resolution supporting Odo and Wang in their battles for tenure.


""I would like to see this as an activist organization,"" Takaki said. ""Whether we survive depends on whether our programs survive and whether our faculty survive.""


Pressure from the association, Ho said, could prompt key administrators to act.


""We only got to where we are now by persistence - by being a persistent thorn in the administrator's side,"" Ho said.

Yes


Lorah, Ed


The availability of rental housing in Seattle is at an all-time low. HUD defines critically low vacancy rates as 5 percent for the overall market and 3 percent for low and moderate income housing. In Seattle the vacancy rate is at I percent or below. This 1 percent figure becomes even more ominous when considered along with the fact of Seattle's ever-growing population A City Displacement Study estimates that at least 70 percent of Seattle's new residents will be renters.


Consider also that because of the current high rate of inflation many of us who rent may never be able to afford to buy homes of our own. Nationwide, it is estimated that less than a fifth of the new families entering the housing market will be able to purchase their own homes compared to two-thirds in the 1930s. In California, only one tenant in twenty can afford to buy.


What this situation creates, in a very real sense, is a new class of ""lifer"" tenants, or people who may reasonably expect to be renters for the rest of their lives.


How the Law Would Work


If passed the Fair Rent Law would place a temporary freeze on rents almost immediately. This freeze would last until March 1, 1984, a little more than 100 days. In the meantime, the Mayor would appoint a 7-member Rental Housing Board of 2 landlords, 2 tenants and 3 people who are neither landlords nor tenants.


Beginning March 1, 1981, landlords would be able to charge a ""base rent"". This would be based on what the landlord charged in July 1979 plus half the increase in the Consumer Price Index from July 1979 to March 1, 1981. All future rent increases would be figured from this base rent.


If a landlord wanted to raise the rent, he or she could do so on an annual basis in one of two ways. For smaller increases the landlord would give notice to the tenant and the Board of increases in operating costs and raise the rent to match those costs. The tenant would be entitled to see proof of the cost increases and to challenge rent increases if they did not match up.


For larger increases the landlord could apply for a hardship increase if able to show that the increase was necessary in order to earn a fair return on the investment. The law contains a detailed set of criteria for guiding the fair return decision including whether the building is being held for speculation or as a long-term investment and the frequency and amount of past increases by the landlord.


The law also contains specific guidelines for condominium conversions, demolitions and rules for ""just cause"" evictions. There is also a ""sunset Clause"" stating that after two successive surveys by the Rental Housing Board showing a 5 percent vacancy rate in Seattle the Board would recommend repeal of the law to the City Council.


Landlords Will Fight Initiative 24


As might be expected, Seattle landlords are going to other strong opposition to Initiative 24. In other cities, when rent-control measures were placed on the ballor, landlords and their hired guns poured thousands of dollars into slick and misleading ad campaigns.


The usual angle taken in these campaigns was to paint a false history of rent-control, i.e., that it has ruined rental housing in other cities by . . . maintenance more difficult, causing abandonments by landlords, and creating fewer vacancies. Much of this misinformation has been gathered from studies commissioned by landlord organizations.


The results of independent studies on moderate rent-controls, such as the one made for the California Department of Housing suggest a different story. Rent control seems to be working much better than landlords would care to admit.


Money, of course, has been a big factor in the fight to win fair rent laws across the country. Residents of Santa Monica won rent control for their city although they were outspent 10 to 1. In San Francisco landlords received money from as far away as Hong Kong to defeat that city's Proposition R. In Seattle we can expect no less. Landlords and real estate interests are highly organized, locally and nationally, with such groups as the National Rental Housing Council ready to pump in money, research, legal assistance, and campaign advice to defeat Initiative 24. The landlords have a lot at stake. So do we.

No


by Nora Connelly


In response to Initiative 24 and the realization that Seattle has a decreasing supply of affordable housing, the Washington Coalition for Affordable Housing was formed. Our group is a broad-based coalition consisting of industry representatives and interested members of the community that became a non-profit corporation in May of this year. Our purpose is two-fold:


1) To see that Initiative 24 is rejected by the voters of Seattle this fall because of its failure to realistically address the rental housing shortage.


2) To discover and promote specific realistic actions that will increase Seattle's inventory of affordable housing.


In addressing Point 1, I have listed the following outline of five main points in Initiative 24 that the Coalition opposes and our reasons for this position.


A. The demolition section of the initiative requires that owners do one of the following:


1. Give proof of structural flaws which indicate that the cost of rehabilitating the building exceeds the cost of replacing it with a comparable building on-site;


2. Have three years ownership with no possibility of fair and reasonable return; or


3. Contract with the City to provide replacement units comparably priced within a two-mile radius, within two years.


Coalition response:


These provisions will essentially stop demolitions with the end result being that current renters in older buildings will be sentenced to living in undermaintained, deteriorating buildings that will be expensive to heat and repair and, over time, become hazardous. There is no incentive for an owner to maintain a building that he originally had plans to demolish.


B. The bureaucracy described in Initiative 24 which will be created to administer the rent control law is modelled after the Santa Monica Rent Control Board which was created in April, 1979. Initiative 24 does not specify the annual registration fees that will be charged to each rental property owner per unit, but in Santa Monica the initial per unit annual fee was $12.50, which has since been raised to $48.00 per unit. The Santa Monica Rent Control Board's budget has been quadrupled in one year, ($1.65 million). The power of the Board in in Initiative 24 includes hiring staff, conducting hearings (in Santa Monica, one hearing equals $450,000), issue subpoenas, promulgate rules and regulations. The Coalition is opposed to the creation of a huge bureaucracy whose budget and administration are separate from the City's and whose efforts and financial resources do not go toward easing the housing shortage, but rather create a shortage through restrictive regulations and disincentives to owners and builders.


C. Property Tax Shift. Erosion of a community's tax base is a natural outgrowth of rent control. Rent control lowers the tax base attributable to multi-family housing. This occurs because tax values of multi-family buildings are based on their capacity to earn. When that capacity is artificially depressed by rent controls, value is depressed and the property taxes on those buildings are lowered. The result is that owners of non-rent controlled properties, i.e., single family homeowners, industrial and commercial, real property owners, must pay a greater proportion of local property taxes.


D. Deterioration of existing housing stock always occurs after rent controls are enacted. Once rents become ""fixed,"" the property owner is forced to operate a building within the boundaries imposed by a limited income. The costs of operating the building, i.e., taxes, utilities, maintenance, and labor, continue to climb with inflation. The rental property owner has no choice but to cut costs in areas such as maintenance and repair. Eventually, if rent controls continue or are extremely severe, even minimum maintenance becomes too much of a financial burden. Deterioration of the building begins, renter dissatisfaction grows. Building abandonment becomes a real possibility as is evidenced in New York City. There is nothing the owner or manager can do because the income necessary to rectify the situation simply is not there.


E. No new buildings. Even though new construction is exempt in Initiative 24, other cities with rent control have witnessed a sharp decline in apartment house building for several reasons:


1. There is no guarantee that new construction will not someday be included under rent control by amending the law;


2. Lenders are reluctant to grant loans in areas where the investment's earning capacity (value) is artificially depressed;


3. New units have a reduced chance of financial success because they must compete with existing, controlled units. New units, because of higher, inflationary construction costs, will have higher rents and will have to compete with the lower rents in the rent controlled buildings. In short, developers enter the market with all the odds against their investment. The result is that they invest elsewhere.


In summary, rent control brings:


-- Deterioration of housing through demolition controls.


-- A huge, expensive, cumbersome bureaucracy whose purpose is to regulate rather than alleviate the problems of the housing market.


-- A shift in the property taxes to unsuspecting other real property owners.


-- Decrease in rental housing maintenance and repair.


-- A halt to new construction.

Seven months have passed since the Chinese Nutrition Program, originally a part of the King County Meals on Wheels Program, came under the management of the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC). The basic purpose of the program is to meet the nutritional needs of the elderly Chinese by serving Chinese food.


Instead of using the second floor of the Eight Immortals Restaurant, the site has been changed to the ground floor of the Heng Association. ""Site was a big issue,"" commented Rita Wang, CISC director. ""The regulations say that the site should be easily accessible to the elderly and the handicapped, and the ground floor is really much more ideal than Eight Immortals' second floor.""


Wang remembered the hunt for a serving site began in December. She talked to several Chinese community leaders about it, and they gave her names of some restaurants. However, she ""didn't like the idea of having the nutrition program in a restaurant because right after lunch is over, you have to leave.""


Wang was about to give up when one of the Heng Association's leaders offered the Association's facilities. The Association became a convenient serving, site on Mondays through Fridays at noon because it was easily accessible. The Association did not charge rent for the use of the space.


CISC staff and volunteers speaking Toisanese, Cantonese, Mandarin and Foukanese serve the elderly portions of rice and two dishes which are prepared by Hon Kee, a new Indochinese restaurant that became the contracted supplier in March Dessert, milk and tea are included in the meal.


The Chinese Nutrition Program is able to feed an average of 40 people every day through funding from the City's Division on Aging, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and donations. But in Wang's opinion, the nutrition program encompasses more than just nutritional needs.


""We also offer support services and social activities,"" said Wang, ""and can communicate with the elderly in their own language.""


Funding for the nutrition program will terminate at the end of the year. CISC has applied for the City's Community Development Block Grant monies. Wang is optimistic about the program's future.


""We have been able to generate a considerable amount of donations from the community and are really grateful for the support we've received.""

Shawn Wong's philosophy is to ""write for himself."" It's ""what you want for yourself"" rather than what others might want out of your writing that's important, Wong said.


Wong, a long-time resident of Seattle, recently won two awards for his first novel, Homebase.


It tells the story of a son who is trying to put his past together in order to define his future. By reading letters written by his parents, who were lost when he was young, the author describes four generations of a Chinese-American family during the 1850s.


Wong won the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association's fiction award. The association selects four to five books a year on the basis of sales and literary excellence.


Wong also won the 15th Annual Governor's Writers Day Award, given by the Washington State Library Commission. The Commission annually reviews literature published by Washington State residents. Wong received one of the two fiction awards given by the commission.


Wong, who has co-edited AIIII-EEEEE AND Yardbird Reader III, said the meaning of the title, Homebase, comes from ""a notion of feeling at home in a country where you were born.""


""It really was a book I wrote for myself,"" said Wong. ""It's a lot of things I've been thinking of myself, figuring out about myself.


""Once that story was written, it cleared the way for other things to come out.""


Wong has also received two other awards for Homebase. One was a grant from the Mary Roberts Reinhart Foundation which helped finance the book. The other award was from the Council on Interracial Books for Children, for a six-page children's story, of which parts were used in Homebase.


Wong said he set no physical goals when he was writing Homebase. He just wrote every day.


""Even if I couldn't write anything new,"" Wong said, ""I at least went back and worked on something that I had already written. If I couldn't do any work at all, I'd read.""


Wong, who graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971 and from California State University, San Francisco, with a master's degree, started writing poems and worked from there.


""I wrote poems like people write letters,"" said Wong. ""They were real personal, usually for or about somebody, about an experience I had with somebody or about somebody I liked.""


Wong says his writing is a constant process, not peaking at a particular style. This was very evident and crucial to the writing of Homebase.


""I think I'm always changing,"" Wong said. ""But now, what caused me to rewrite Homebase eight times was that my experience and consciousness was changing. The format I originally started Homebase in was so confining, it was limiting me to what I wanted to say.""


When he started writing the conclusion of Homebase, which was several years after he had started the beginning of the book, it was restricting Wong to what he wanted to write. When the end of the book didn't fit the beginning of the book, Wong said he ""just had to get rid of the book.""


From that period on, Wong began demanding more from his writing. He got more serious, he said, and began asking more from himself as a writer, which is not an easy process. But it's a process by which a writer such as Wong has grown.


""When you're personally satisfied with whatever you've written down, then I think you're getting somewhere,"" said Wong.


Wong doesn't have to worry about whether he can make a living as a writer. He has been asked by McGraw-Hill to write the novel of a Chinese-American family from the 1850s to the 1920s.


""In that sense I've been real lucky,"" admits Wong. ""In the 12 years I've been writing, I've never had to write anything I didn't want to write. I've never had to 'pay my dues.'""

Known among the Asian community and local tennis players for her tennis clinics, Amy Yee recently gained citywide recognition. Mayor Charles Royer proclaimed September 28, 1980 Amy Yee Day in Seattle. Yee was honored for the numerous years she volunteered teaching tennis to Seattle youth.


That day was one of the biggest moments in her life, Yee revealed. ""The Mayor was there, a couple of City Councilpersons were there. It was really nice."" She was also presented with a watercolor painting done by Andrew Chinn, a local artist. The painting is on display at the Seattle Tennis Center where Yee currently teachers tennis.


Yee, originally from Cleveland, Ohio, began playing tennis when she was a junior at Vashon High School on Vashon Island. She played on the school team. Tennis was such a minor sport then that high school tournament play combined three counties -- King, Pierce, and Kitsap, otherwise known as the Tri-County League -- for competition. At that time, only the rich played tennis, Yee said.


Since then, Yee has competed in tennis tournaments in cities such as Reno, Las Vegas, Houston and Salt Lake City. She fondly remembers the first city tournament she played in. The year was 1950. ""I didn't have much time to practice,"" Yee recalled, ""and I didn't expect to win it."" She usually does well in competition, that is, until this year, Yee said, explaining that she plays in the senior category now but there's a younger group moving up to the senior bracket every year. ""It makes it pretty tough,"" she added.


While tennis has been a major part of her life, it has not been her whole life. Yee married and raised four children, Joyce, Linda, Gordon and Gary, all of them grown now.


Yee does not plan to retire from teaching tennis yet. There is plenty of help at the Tennis Center so that she can take off and do the things she wants. Tennis has been good to her. Besides being a good sport and providing good exercise, tennis allows her to meet with her friends, Yee continued. ""When you like a sport, there's nothing you don't like about it.""

The International District welcomes a new business that is the first of its kind in the area. Liem's Pet Shop opened in February. It is located at 511 S. Maynard Alley, near Wa Sang Groceries.


The shop is small, but can house 70 birds and about three dozen tanks of goldfish and tropical fish. The front window has a display of colorful finches chirping loudly. Inside, rows of aquariums, food supplies, and empty tanks are for sale. The price of fish ranges from $1 to $20, comparatively cheaper than other pet stores. The finches cost $25-$40.


Owner Djin Kwie Liem greets customers with a smile. His English is limited, but he speaks Mandarin and Cantonese. He works alone on weekdays, and his wife helps him during weekends. The shop is open every day except Monday, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.


Liem buys his birds locally, but imports his fish from Singapore and Hong Kong. The problem with importing, he said, is that many of the fish die on the first day of arrival. Those surviving the first day do all right, though. Liem tries to maintain the population by raising the young in separate tanks.


Raising fish and birds began as a hobby. With the encouragement of his friends, Liem opened a pet shop in his home town, Sabah, Malaysia. He operated the shop for seven years before selling it to move to the United States.


Liem and his wife decided to come to America to give their children a better future. ""There are no jobs for young after they graduate in government or in private businesses,"" he said.


Liem came to Seattle because all of his relatives, including his parents and eight brothers and sisters, live here. He and his family like Seattle but sometimes find it cold.


Arriving in Seattle five months ago, Liem at first wanted to work for someone, but instead followed an old parable. ""Let's say that you have an oil bottle,"" he explained. ""It's easier to retain it as an oil bottle than to pour the oil out, wash it, and put something else in. So I thought it would be better if I continued in the same business than to start something entirely new.""


Settling in another country means starting all over again. For the moment, Liem is investing his own money for supplies. He says that it costs $20 a day to feed the fish and birds.


Liem expects business to be slow in the beginning, but he is hopeful. He believes that his pet shop will support the family as it did when they were in Malaysia. Liem says that he has no regrets about leaving Malaysia when he considers that his children will have a good future.

A Filipino community group has intiated action to form an Asian advisory board to evaluate the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at the University of Washington. That was one of three recommendations presented at an open forum February 1, by the Education Task Force of the Filipino Community of Seattle, Inc. (FCSI).


University students and staff in the EOP Asian Division have voiced concern over resignations and policy changes within the program. Since June, 1979, the Asian Division director and two Asian counselors have resigned. Lack of support and policy changes under the administration of Dr. Herman Lujan, Vice President for Minority Affairs, were among reasons cited for the resignations.


Rosita Farinas, Education Task Force co-chairperson, said the drive to recruit persons to sit on the advisory board is under way. Farinas explained the group's responsibility would be to identify problem areas within EOP, especially the Asian Division, and to draw Dr. Lujan's attention to these areas.


The FCSI group also recommended a new counselor be added to the Asian Division by mid-March, and that two additional counselors be hired by the beginning of Autumn quarter, 1980.


The third recommendation was to form a committee to re-evaluate the EOP's new admissions procedure and requirements. Those requirements include mandatory interviews and testing of all in-coming students. The students are also put under a contract to make up basic skills deficiencies and to report all class changes to their counselor.


The Task Force asked Dr. Lujan to act on the recommendations by the March 9 FCSI council meeting.


Farinas said that the community and students are not aware of many aspects of the policy changes, and hopes the advisory board will address them. She is confident that community concern and support is alive.


About 200 persons attended the forum, including Dr. Lujan, assistant Vice President Mike Castillano, and newly-appointed Asian Division director Jerry Shigaki. A variety of issues about the EOP came out in the presentations and ensuing question and answer period.


Dr. Lujan said policy changes were made in EOP because of low student retention rates, an increased emphasis on student placement, and the Bakke decision. He reported that, despite the mandatory testing and interviews, the application rate for next fall was going as well as last year.


""More completed forms by now means we'll have more applications this year,"" Lujan said.


Former Asian Division counselor Steve Aspiras addressed the lack of adequate staffing in the Division, and said one reason he quit last November was low staff morale.


""We didn't get the support from upper administration,"" Aspiras said. ""There's only so much a counselor can do. I didn't want to stay and do a half-ass job,"" he continued.


Lujan said he would fill Aspiras' position and add one new counselor in the division on a temporary basis. Because of the program's carry-forward budget, he explained, no new permanent staffing can be filled.


Tom Eng, representing the Asian Student Association, asked why the new admissions policy required two years' permanent residency when the regular admissions required only one year. Mike Castillano replied that the two-year rule was chosen because the University does not have adequate programs for ESL (English as a second language) and that most recent immigrants are transfer students.


The crowd raised concern over the mandatory contracts all freshmen must sign. Nori Mihara, executive staff assistant to Lujan, said the contracts are legally binding and carried a threat to discontinue financial aid if not followed.


Maria Batayola, a former UW student, asked how the agreements would be monitored and what staff will analyze that information and contact the students if they are not fulfilling the contract.


""A better than average staff nationally, which is the criterion we would be measured against if taken to court,"" responded Lujan.


""When you look at the students that are in need versus counselors, the Asian Division is not at an unusually high disadvantage,"" he continued.

The Asian/Pacific Community Task Force was established last spring to coordinate a unified response from the community to Office of Minority Affairs director Dr. Herman Lujan's admission policy for the Educational Opportunity Program at the University of Washington. Dr. Lujan had instituted a policy restricting admissions to minority students who were likely to complete the university program, while the original policy had been to admit any interested minority student. The Task Force met regularly during the summer and this fall. It has sent a representative, Ms. Maria Batayola, to the University's Task Force to Review Educational Opportunity Program admissions policies and procedures, which was convened by U.W. President William Gerberding in August, 1980.


The Asian Pacific Community Task Force will submit the following to the University's Task Force:


Seattle's Asian/Pacific Education Task Force has been actively involved in the struggle to reverse the University's implementation of Herman Lujan's Educational Opportunity Program's (EOP) admission policy. His policy would substantially impair the purpose of an EOP, and that is to afford those who have been historically victimized by institutionalized racism an equal opportunity to attend the University of Washington.


We might have believed that the University had good intentions in ""Bakke-proofing"" But it's very apparent to us that, through Lujan, it has instead selectively ""minority-proofed"" EOP admissions. Rather than recruiting and admitting those minority students ""who are disadvantaged [and] often have grade points that do not reflect their inherent capabilities ..."" (Oct. 1968, Prof. Charles Evans' report to the Senate), it has instead admitted those students who would qualify for admission under traditional standards.


""EOP is embarked on an activity to attract into the Honors Program high achieving minority students from Washington's high schools."" (Minutes -- EOP Policy Advisory Board, January 16, 1980, Page 4.)


Therefore, it is the position of the Asian/Pacific Education Task Force that the Task Force to Review Educational Opportunity Program Admissions Policies and Procedures reaffirms the University's commitment to affording equal opportunity to minorities, by rejecting Lujan's admission plan. And in its stead it reinstates the former policy with its attendant affirmative EOP philosophy, and testing that is not culturally biased.


Comments and participation are invited at the Asian Pacific Community Task Force meeting on November 18, 1980, 6:30 PM, Asian Family Affair office, 417 Rainier Avenue South.

The Tenkatsu Restaurant, closed two years ago after 32 years in business, will reopen May 1 at its original location at Sixth S. and S. Main St. The restaurant will serve the public in the New Imperial House, a low-income elderly housing project with retail and commercial businesses on the ground floor. The Imperial House completed construction in September, 1979.


""My father originally started it in San Francisco,"" explained Ken Takai, ""then came here to Seattle after the war and continued business.""


The Tenkatsu's clientele has changed over the years, observed Takai. At the beginning, mostly Japanese and Filipinos came. Business picked up as Nisei (second generation Japanese) students brought their friends, and war-brides with their husbands and family learned of the small Japanese family restaurant. It kept going mainly by word of mouth in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Caucasians and Blacks created a greater mixture of customers.


""I like to see this,"" Takai said, ""because it shows that people are becoming more aware of other races and their cultural backgrounds.""


Two years ago, Danny Woo sold the original building to Century Construction, a private developer. Century Construction demolished the old building and put up the Imperial House. Tenkatsu's lease was not renewed, so the family was forced to close. Century Construction was unable to find anybody to occupy the space in the new building, and Tenkatsu was asked to return.


""We were in the same location for 32 years before,"" said Takai. ""We will try to keep it as close to the old image as possible. The decor will change but the service, menu and atmosphere will remain the same.""


The area was a thriving Nihonmachi (Japantown) long ago. Takai said it would be good to see Japanese town revived in that location which the Japanese community could identify with.


Takai also said that there is a resurgence in ethnic foods and that the smaller restaurants like the Tenkatsu provide intimate contact with the ethnic cuisine and its treatment not found in larger restaurants.


""My father pushed us back into the business because he wanted something to do,"" said Takai. ""Elderly people, all they know is work, and when taken out of that environment, they feel useless. We are reopening mainly for my father than for ourselves.""

Compiled by International District Emergency Center


This incident has been compiled by IDEC and was taken from its files.


The district youth can often be found playing in the alleys and the streets. This night was no different. Often IDEC medics will keep an eye on the youth, watching for trouble.


Once the eerie sound of dragging scraping metal and breaking glass was heard. The youth stopped playing, everyone becomes quiet. After looking up and down the street, a medic runs to the phone and calls the fire dispatcher on a direct line. There were no reported auto accidents in the area. IDEC medics decide it's probably on the freeway.


Medics start towards the freeway. Nearing the freeway, they see a figure on the freeway, ""is anyone hurt?"" The figure responded, ""yes, real bad."" One medic climbed over the fence, while the other followed with the medical kit. There was only one car involved in the accident.


Two men were removing one of the victims from the vehicle (usually we never remove people from cars unless we have enough equipment, manpower or if the victim is in real danger.) The two men seemed to be doing fine and a medic moved in to assist them. The second medic attended another victim laying near the vehicle.


One of the victims had severe head trauma and was bleeding. In the darkness, medics could barely see, except for the lights from passing cars. Finding no pulse or respiration, CPR was started immediately by an IDEC medic and a bystander. The bystander asked for some emergency trauma equipment which IDEC does not carry. The bystander turns out to be a doctor.


A state patrol car pulls up. The patrolman directs traffic after calling for a medic unit.


Fire engine crews drive up. The firefighters yell ""we're doing ok"" shine their flashlights on us. The sodden illumination makes you realize you're covered with blood and that the victim is just a teenage girl.


The medic unit finally arrives and we load the victim into the car while continuing CPR. Arms begin to get tired, then one of the firemen puts his hands in your place and compresses the breastbone. The doctor who was doing CPR is in there directing operations. The medic unit turns on its siren and screams off from the scene.


Injuries to the second victim were not as traumatic. An ambulance arrives and takes her to the hospital.


Before leaving the scene, we gave the state patrolman the number for IDEC in case they needed us again. Back at the office, the youth had been waiting to see what happened. The youth asked no questions, having grown up around the center. Our soiled uniforms and equipment told the story.


IDEC medics went to the hospital to get some of our equipment which went with the victim. We asked one of the paramedics ""how did she do?""; he replied, ""Didn't make it, they have her in there."" We followed the paramedic into the room to view the body. She was a young kid. Later we found out that she wanted to commit suicide because she only had a few weeks to live. What we didn't understand was, why take your friend with you?


The doctor helping out before never gave us his name. He just left when the victim arrived at the hospital and had adequate help. Neither IDEC or SPD medics found out who he was.


IDEC medics finally returned to the office. Medics re-packed their kits, cleaned up and changed uniforms, while waiting for the next call. Wishing silently that this humid night would soon pass.

September 21, 1980 marked the eighth anniversary of martial law in the Philippines. This year was indeed a painful one for the Filipino people, as letters and personal accounts from family and friends testify to the inflation and recession gripping the capitalist system and exacting a bitter toll upon the people of the Third World countries.


In the first six months of 1980, inflation rate rose to 23.7 percent, bringing the peso value to 37.5 centavos. In Feb. 1980 the people witnessed a 50 percent leap in gas prices and a 36 percent hike in kerosene, diesel oil and industrial fuel, with corresponding increases in just about everything else, since all are subject to either manufacture or transport or both. As for people's health and well-being, the Asian Development Bank shows that the caloric consumption of Filipinos was the lowest in Asia, not significantly better than that of Bangla Desh.


Most staggering was the foreign debt, which by mid-1980 had climbed to $11.05 billion from an already unheard-of $9.78 billion in 1979.


Why is there a crisis in the Philippines


Traditional political opponents of Marcos like Roxas, Salonga, Aquino, Manglapus and others say that it's all Marcos' fault. They say it is mainly because of his ""mismanagement"" of the Philippine economy and his corruption. They even go to the extent of saying that if only Marcos and his wife Imelda were not corrupt or did not live extravagantly, there wouldn't be a crisis.


Marcos, on the other hand, has another explanation, saying that the economic crisis is not his fault. He says the whole world capitalist system is in crisis -- inflation, recession, and that the ""Arabs want more money for their oil."" With all these reasons, he is absolving himself from any responsibility for the crisis. However, Marcos is very much responsible for the crisis, as much as the system he is protecting.


Even before martial law, the Philippines has always been poor. The Philippine economic system has been dependent on and dominated by foreign capital, mainly U.S. capital. This means that the Philippine economy is run not for the benefit and prosperity of the Filipino people and the Philippine nation, but for the superprofits of the multi-nationals and the big capitalist countries. This type of domination prevented the Filipino people from developing the economy and their own needs. As a result, the Philippines is used as a source of cheap raw materials and cheap labor and as dumping ground for more expensive goods.


What then is Marcos' role?


Marcos has always been the U.S.'s main political ally and its main security guard in the Philippines. Martial law was imposed to stop the growing nationalism that was threatening U.S. interest. Thus Marcos' role is to preserve U.S. domination in the Philippines.


Right after martial law, hundreds of presidential decrees were imposed by Marcos, abolishing the freedom of the press, speech and assembly and ensuring the continuation of his illegal martial rule. And to satisfy the American and foreign investors, he has made it a law to assure them of 100 percent repariation of profits and guarantees that workers will not strike for better wages. In other words, Marcos has made the Philippines a haven for American and foreign investors and hell for millions of suffering Filipino workers.


Resistance grows


The year 1979-80 saw the awakening of an unprecedented mass movement reminiscent of the powerful protests of 1969-72. While not of the same magnitude, the recent upsurge displayed broader participation of various sectors, bringing together students, religious leaders, urban poor, peasants, and workers. Mass actions in the form of marches and rallies are conducted both in Manila and major urban centers and also increasingly in small, isolated barrios and towns. These mass actions are a testament not only to the people's anger but also to political maturation, a realization that an oppressed people's only weapon against their oppressor is their collective effort, fighting in creative ways to put an end to the crisis.

International District housing advocates are upset about and opposed to the planned conversion of the Terrace View Hotel, located at 605 Yesler, to offices rather than housing.


The International Special Review District Board, which oversees physical development in the area, is also on record as opposing the renovation by Heritage Group, Ltd., a Seattle development firm which has done renovation including the Pioneer and Westland Buildings in Pioneer Square. The building, according to Heritage Group, Ltd. spokesperson Dick Sontgerath, came under the ownership of the Terrace View Partnership on August 1. The partnership, Sontgerath said, is an ""investment group with Heritage having a minor interest and with Heritage as the spokesman."" Heritage proposes to rehabilitate the Terrace View into new, air-conditioned office space. The building is currently vacant and had, until recently, been a hotel.


Inter*Im (International District Improvement Association) director Bob Santos said he is opposed to the change because ""we think it will hurt our chances with the NSA process."" The NSA (Neighborhood Strategy Area) Program is a five-year government program to provide 450 units of subsidized and market-rate housing through rehabilitating buildings in the International District.


According to Santos, it would take away the available housing stock for the area's residents.


Andy Mizuki, from the International District Housing Alliance, also stated his opposition to the board and expressed concern about the encroaching development from the Downtown business district into the International District.


The board at its July 22 meeting voted to deny the office use idea as presented by the Heritage Group because it conflicts with:


-- the goals of the Neighborhood Strategy Area Program for the ID;


-- the goals of mixed income housing development onthe hillside CM (Metropolitan Commercial) zone, as defined in the Kumata Report, the District Design Report and the Development Regulations; and


-- adjacent uses, such as the community garden, Kobe Terrace Park and existing residential buildings.


Heritage, however, presented its argument that the site of the proposed renovation is located in a CM zone, which ""allows the professional office use and thus conforms to the International Special Review District Development Regulations."" And citing the Seattle Zoning Code, Heritage Attorney G. Richard Hill said that unless ""the International Special Review District Regulations specifically modify allowed uses under the zoning code, those uses shall be allowed.""


Although the board has denied the concept of the proposal, according to board staffperson Greg Ptucha, Heritage can still pursue the possibility of doing the project. Heritage, he said, has submitted a formal request that the environmental review process, the initial step to determine the feasibility of the project, proceed under the City's Department of Community Development. The Special Review Board will not take formal action on a certificate of approval on the proposal until the process is completed.


If and when the board does take action and that action is negative to the developer, Sontgerath said, then Heritage ""would appeal"" the board's decision.

Governor Dixy Lee Ray's ""official ear"" on Asian American issues recently opened an office in Seattle's International District to be closer to ""the largest Asian American community in the state,"" said Diane Wong, executive director of the Asian American Affairs Commission.


The commission was established in 1973 and is responsible for ""enhancing the lives of Asian Pacific Americans in the entire state"" Wong said. A two person staff handles the commission's expanding workload.


""I felt we were losing touch"" by being in Olympia, Wong said. Also, she continued, ""a lot of things are happening here and I felt that the commission is only as effective as the support I can generate"" by being in touch with the commission's constituents.


Wong has been director since September, 1978.


""We are the Governor's official ear on Asian American issues,"" she said. ""We advise the Governor and state agencies and work with them to develop procedures and policies beneficial to Asian Americans.""


The commission works on a broad spectrum of issues, Wong says, usually those which ""have a wide effect on a large number of Asians in a positive way"" rather than on issues which affect only the individual involved. The commission also works with the state legislature. Wong said she would not want to be called a lobbyist but rather an advocate for the Asian American community in her work with the state legislature.


One of the commission's primary goals, Wong said, is to identify legislative issues and bills on both the state and federal level which affect Asian Americans such as the current health bill now before the legislature.


The commission's role, Wong says, is to do a lot of preliminary legwork such as planning strategy, contacting interested community groups, analyzing the issue in question and then contact the legislators, educate them and persuade them of the need to pass or not pass a given bill. ""They really listen to you,"" she said. The commission ""gives an official reason for the legislators to hang their support on,"" she said. Most legislators are responsive, according to Wong, particularly the ones from King and Pierce Counties.


""I really like for people in King County to think of us as their arm in Olympia. The Seattle-King County area started the council (commission). It would benefit all of us if King County became more involved.""


The commission is currently working on several major issues including redress for Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II, bilingual education, and the state's Indochinese Resettlement program for which the commission will be hiring a coordinator shortly. The coordinator will be responsible for organizing the statewide network of services for the incoming refugees, identifying areas where service is not being provided and plug them in to areas where service is being provided, Wong said.


Another potential issue for the commission is the housing shortage crisis in Seattle-King County, ""particularly for low income Asian elderly,"" Wong said.

You could count all of the Asian American reporters who have appeared before local television news cameras and still have one finger left. The latest addition to this select group is Lori Matsukawa, general assignment news reporter for KOMO-TV.


Born and educated in Honolulu, Matsukawa first aspired to ""tickle"" the voices and teach piano. Her career plans changed, however, when as a high school senior, Matsukawa became Miss Teenage America of 1974. Her interest in journalism developed because ""there were always reporters hanging out"" wherever she went during her travels. Being a reporter seemed an ""outdoorsy"" job where you could meet the public as part of the public, she said.


Matsukawa, despite her relatively young age (24), is a seasoned veteran of broadcast media. At Stanford University, she served as feature editor, copy editor, opinions editor, and reporter for the Stanford Daily and newscaster and producer of a public affairs health show on the school's radio station. She has reported for the Honolulu Advertiser and worked at television stations in San Francisco, Redding and Portland. She worked as an anchor person at her last two stops.


Matsukawa jumped at the chance to work in Seattle. Seattle, she explained, besides being the ""17th largest television market"" in the country, has a ""large and cosmopolitan"" Asian American community. Developing Asian awareness in college, she is enthusiastic about becoming a part of the community. She said, ""I've always wanted to join a JACL (Japanese American Citizens League), and I have heard that the Seattle chapter had the reputation of being a rabble rouser.""


One of Matsukawa's latest news stories was a three-part report on economic development in the International District. Matsukawa said that as a newcomer, the best way for her to find out about the community was to go out and interview people in the context of a news report. Matsukawa found that the government is willing to put money into the area, although she noted there was resistance from some property owners toward redevelopment in the District. She said her news report was a ""good introduction into some of the politics that affect the Asian community.""


Although many non-white news reporters do not want to be classified as ""minority news"" reporters, Matsukawa would like to develop more stories about the Asian community. Lori noted that while her bosses give her leeway toward story development, she had to push for coverage of the Bon Odori.


She said that the news media, or at least KOMO, tries its best to cover minority community news. Matsukawa pointed to the controversy at the University of Washington's Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and to the fight over the proposed police station in the Central District. These stories, Matsukawa explained, are covered because the stories have ""controversy, opposing groups and is visual."" Stories such as health needs, nutrition and economic development are harder to cover because such subjects can't be covered in a three-minute segment. Minority communities, she added, can increase news coverage by sending out press releases to the station.


Matsukawa would like to see more Asians in broadcast media. For many years Asians were invisible on the screen. But now, she said, Asians are entering journalism school with a career goal. She said that television stations are making conscious efforts to recruit Blacks because Blacks are the largest group of minorities. She noted that local television stations are beginning to hire Asians, at least on the production end. For those who want to be on camera, she encourages aspiring Asian broadcasters to try out smaller markets like Redding, gain experience, and then move to the larger markets.


Lori Matsukawa is very visible in Seattle. She is the only Asian who is on television more than Bob Santos. She would like to stay here and be more involved in the Asian American-community. For someone who has traveled around the world and has worked in five different places in four years, the transient Miss Teenage America turned news reporter needs a place to call home.

A tenant of the Pike Place Market, claiming that the Pike Place Historical Commission closed her Filipino food take-out because of competition with a Vietnamese restaurant next door, may again run into trouble when she tries to reopen her business in a few months.


The commission, which twice ordered Connie Tajon's Manila Grill closed, must approve her current plans to reopen it and, according to her attorney Rodney Wong, problems may still arise.


The restaurant has been closed since September in its latest bout with the commission. John Turnbull, a commission member, claimed the restaurant was closed because it did not comply with use and design regulations. The commission controls development in the market.


Tajon could not be reached for comment, but Wong argued that the commission's ruling is only an excuse to hold down competition in the highly regulated market.


The Manila Grill has been closed off and on since last January, when the commission first acted on complaints by owners of the Saigon Over the Counter Restaurant. The commission decided that the Manila Grill was violating guidelines by serving Filipino side dishes and by installing stools and a bigger kitchen.


The changes were made without commission approval, Turnbull said.


""It was too different from what we wanted the business to be,"" he said. ""Their set-up was fairly similar to what Saigon had - they were running it like a small Asian cafe.""


Turnbull said that the restaurant had originally been conceived as a black barbecue take-out and was run by a black woman from Louisiana.


The Reyes family (who purchased the business last September) first initiated the menu and design changes that Tajon continued after buying them out.


Tajon challenged the commission's ruling before a City of Seattle hearing examiner. The examiner upheld the commission's decision.


Turnbull maintained that the problem was a personality conflict between the two business owners. The Nguyens, who own Saigon Over the Counter, were angry, Turnbull said, because the Manila Grill was not following market rules.


The commission stepped in, he said, only after the situation had gotten out of hand. Spats of violence and a polarization over the dispute among building tenants, Turnbull said, forced the commission to take action.


Wong disagreed: ""The disputes may have initiated the problem, but the main issue is that the Tajons wanted to open a restaurant with Filipino side dishes, and the commission felt that under the ordinances and regulations they couldn't do it.


""They wanted to serve a lot of rice and other side dishes which were allowed.


""The commission felt she was encroaching on other people's restaurants, creating too much of a competition,"" Wong said. ""Their rationale was that her lease said it could only be a barbecue place and here she was selling dishes similar to the restaurant.""


Technically, Tajon can set up a Filipino restaurant, said Wong, a new attorney in the case. This time, he said, Tajon, will comply with, rather than challenge, the commission's rulings. Wong said that Tajon will present her proposal to set up a barbecue take-out with side dishes to the Pike Place Preservation and Development Authority and the Historic Commission.


The commission must approve her plans, which include general repairs and installing a kitchen.


Wong admitted that problems may still arise. ""Saigon will make sure Connie adheres to the regulations as strictly as possible,"" he said.


Nevertheless, he said, the dispute between the two restaurants is only a side issue.


""It shouldn't have any bearing on the case. The real issue is whether the commission will allow her to have an expanded menu or not - and they should.""


Wong said he was waiting for Tajon's plans before setting a definite course of action.


Turnbull said that this is the first time since the market was redone that problems have developed because a business changed its set-up.


""Now we know we have to draw the lines real hard, real fast and real early on. We've learned a lot from our mistakes.""


The only solution, Turnbull said, is for Tajon to move her business somewhere else in the market. He noted, however, that she would have to wait a year before space becomes available in the crowded market.


Wong maintained that is it not feasible for her to move her business.


""It wouldn't be logical to abandon this place and wait for another place because it will never show up,"" he said.

The Kubota Gardens, 25 acres of land in southeast Seattle containing one of the rarest collections of Japanese plant materials found outside of Japan, may soon become the site of a 480 unit condominium complex.


The project, still in the preliminary planning stages, is beginning to stir community descension and opposition. The Kubota Gardens is bounded by 51st Ave. S. on the west and Renton Ave. S. and 55 Ave. S. on the east. The proposed development calls for 480 unit condominium complex; 15 buildings, 32 units per building (one, two and three bedroom units); and one and one-half stalls per unit parking garage located underneath each complex.


The estimated cost of each condominium range between $60,000 to $110,000.


On July 31, a meeting was held by the Southend Seattle Community Organization (SESCO) to present community concerns to the City and to obtain City policy concerning land use. Among those present were three city officials and land owner, Tak Kubota.


Residents at the meeting voted to reject the proposed project fearing that such a large development would only attract more crime and vandalism to the residential neighborhood.


Another concern is the maintenance and development of the five and one-half acres of garden which will be retained amidst the condominium complex. The annual cost is estimated at $100,000 which is to be set aside and used to maintain the garden but the community is doubtful that this term will be met. A woman present at the meeting demanded ""more guarantees"" that the Gardens will be kept up before she could accept the proposed development.


The 25-acre area is presently designated for single family zoning. If the proposed project is to be constructed, the builder must apply for rezoning which would provide for multiple family, high density zoning.


Some of the residents have already begun petitioning to retain the present single family zoning classification and are in strong opposition to any changes allowing higher density development.


It is likely that a rezoning application will be submitted sometime after the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), in the process of being drafted, is released. This report will assess social and environmental effects the development will have on the surrounding neighborhood.


A large part of the decision to grant or prohibit rezoning is based on the EIS results. Community input is also an important factor in making the decision.


The Gardens have been in existence for 53 years and have become a historical landmark of the community.


The Gardens started in 1929 when Fujitaro Kubota bought six and one-half acres of land. He was awarded the Fifth Order of the Sacred Treasure issued by the Japanese Government for promoting Japanese relations expressed through landscape and gardens.


In 1950, Tak and Tom Kubota, surviving sons, established a partnership and have since assumed total cost of maintaining and further developing the Gardens.


Seeking a more economically feasible means of maintaining the Gardens, the Kubotas decided to sell the land. Tak Kubota admitted the decision was one of the hardest he has ever had to make after devoting much time and effort to its development.


Kubota, long time resident of the community, sympathized at the meeting with the concerns the community had regarding the proposed condominium development and was open to any suggestions they could offer.


He said he was careful to select a builder who he felt would be most sensitive to community concerns and would consider them during the planning stages of the project.


By working with the builder and members of the community, Kubota is optimistic that a compromise suiting the needs of all those involved can be reached.

""It is important for Asians to be writing about Asians,"" agreed three prizewinning authors whose children's books share ""slice of life"" Asian experiences with non-Asian audiences.


The authors -- Jose Aruego, Yoshiko Uchida, and Lawrence Yep -- shared their trials, frustrations, and successes with about 140 educators, librarians, and potential writers at an all-day conference April 4 at the University of Washington.


""We are the ones who know how it feels to be Asian,"" said Uchida, who has written Japanese folktales and realistic fiction with Japanese American characters. Her book Journey To Topaz, published in 1971, was awarded an American Library Association Notable Book award.


""We write best about what we are most familiar with.""


Aruego, an illustrator and author recognized as an Outstanding Filipino in the Arts in the Philippines, said that an Asian influence often creeps into stories by Asian authors.


""My work was the result of my background and experience as an Asian,"" said Aruego, who got his start selling cartoons in New York City. ""I realized that my Asian heritage was on the line.""


Aruego said his books subtly represent Asian culture. Through simple but imaginative animal drawings, Aruego transforms Asian folktales into animal stories that all children can relate to. Asian characters become crocodiles or cats, he said.


Lawrence Yep started out as a science fiction writer. His first book, Sweetwater was a science fiction novel for children.


""In it (Sweetwater), I found myself talking a little bit about Chinese Americans,"" said Yep, who went on to write Dragonwings, a 1976 Newberry Honor book depicting the life of a Chinese immigrant in San Francisco.


All three authors said they struggled with the paradox of conveying their Asian experiences to a non-Asian audience. Yep noted that while authors should not try to be stereotypical, they must be accepted by a mainstream audience.


Few books have been printed with Asian American characters in contemporary situations, editor Anne Maley of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich said.


""There are children who actually need such literature for survival,"" said Bill Towner, Kimball Elementary School librarian. ""A whole part of their heritage is sadly neglected without ethnic literature.""


Regardless of ethnic background, Towner said, exposure to a wide variety of literature is vital for any child.


""Literature provides the opportunity to rub shoulders with someone else, to walk a mile in someone else's moccasins.""


More Asian American literature is needed, Yep emphasized, to provide more balance.


""There's always time for re-evaluation when we have 100 writers,"" Yep said.

A Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) official has filed racial discrimination charges against local HUD administrators, The Examiner has learned.


Jerome Curry, formerly chief of the Seattle HUD Loan Management Department and HUD Asian Employment Program Coordinator, has been on extended leave since December 10. ""I've been used and I don't intend to be used any more,"" he said in an interview earlier this month.


Curry, a black, has charged HUD administrators with ""impeding my efforts to fulfill my duties and responsibilities in helping achieve affirmative action and equal opportunity as it relates to HUD."" Curry, who came to HUD in 1969, said he has filed for retirement disability based on stress brought on by racial discrimination.


Curry said he has released himself from the designation as Asian Employment Program Coordinator. He said he was originally hired to ""help HUD carry equal opportunity into the communities that federal housing programs had passed by,"" but that those efforts have been blocked by administrators.


Curry, who noted that he has twice been nominated federal employee of the year, said he was reassigned special assistant to one of the individuals he has charged with racial discrimination, Lynn Stowell, local director of housing for HUD. In his new position, he lacks the ability to commit money which is the ""name of the game,"" he said. ""I would only make recommendations and someone else would make the decision. In other words, I'm the house nigger.""


Stowell confirmed that area HUD administrators are under investigation. ""It's in the hands of the proper authorities and to discuss it would be to prejudice the case,"" he said.


Curry said he was told that his reassignment was because of his ""attitude"" and ""hang up"" with HUD management.


Curry pointed out that Congress designated HUD as the federal agency to monitor and review equal opportunity. ""I'm saying that HUD itself is not abiding by the law,"" Curry stated.


Problems with housing projects in the International District such as the Downtowner Apartments and the Imperial House, Curry said, resulted from the failure of HUD to carry out its responsibilities.


Curry said HUD administrators approved a commitment to the developer of the 99-unit Imperial House project over his objections.


The recently-completed senior citizen complex has come under heavy criticism by community representatives who point out that the developer, Century Construction, revised the original plans approved by the International Special Review District Board, stripping the building of nearly all its decorative features.


Curry said he had complained that ""there would be problems with the figures that were projected"" and unsuccessfully sought to withhold the HUD commitment until the ""figures were cleaned up.""


In a recent letter to Darel Grothaus, director of the Department of Community Development, Greg Ptucha, city staff-person for the Review Board, said, ""What has resulted . . . is a building that is visually bland, stark, and, although appreciated for the housing it provides, is thought an eyesore by just about everyone in the ID (almost literally).""


Stowell said Century Construction presented ""a nice design package"" which had to be revised because inflation made it impossible to build what had been originally projected, given the fixed budget. HUD approved the change orders for the project, he said. Asked if HUD had any responsibility to pressure the developer to add some of the original features left off the building. Stowell responded, ""no.""


The owner, Orville Cohen, of Century Construction, could not be reached for comment. At press time, the City Superintendent of Buildings told The Examiner he would be meeting Grothaus to discuss specific recommendations which could be offered to Century Construction.


Curry also charged that recurring problems of maintenance at the Downtowner Apartments, a 250-unit rehabilitated building, are the fault of HUD, which did not allow adequate money ""to do the rehab work that was necessary.""


""It was a cosmetic job,"" he said.


The current HUD administrators. Curry said, ""feel 200 units of housing (The International House and Imperial House) and the Bush (Hotel) places the International District on a low priority. If the District is able to put together additional packages -- new or rehab -- they will be put into a bureaucratic rating process with other development packages that truly are not of any priority nature.""


Curry said HUD ""does business with a certain clique of people,"" and ""the same little groups get the commitments.""


""The office is basically lazy and the least work they can do that's the direction they go,"" he said.


Curry filed his complaint with the as sistant secretary for equal opportunity in Washington, D.C. ""Since I filed my complaint. I've seen more minorities hired than in all 11 years that I've been with HUD,"" he said.

The traditional Buddhist belief that when spirits of the dead return to earth, it's a joyous time for togetherness, is a custom which is very much alive today. This festive occasion is the Obon odori, a colorful, summer celebration of Japanese folk dancing. It is time to reflect upon the past hardships of our ancestors.


The Obon odori traditionally has three parts in Japan. The first is very somber, where people visit the gravesites of the deceased. The gravesite visits are done two weeks prior to the festive part, which is the rejoicing of Buddha's teachings and honoring the presence of the spirits of family and friends. Dancers, young and old in their colorful yukatas (dress), all move simultaneously to the music from a raised platform where the rhythmic beat of the taiko drummer resounds. The third part of the celebration is the udo bon where paper boats with candles are sent down the river, signifying the departure of the spirits. This last part is not practiced in Seattle.


The Obon odori in Seattle started before World War II and has grown in popularity over the years, making it one of the three major summer activities of Seattle's Seafair. The Obon odori takes place at the Seattle Buddhist Church at 14th and Main St., where folk dances from different prefectures of Japan are adapted. The Seattle festivities are not complete without the performance by the Drum and Bugle Corps and All-Girl Color Guard. And performing for the first time in Seattle, the Kinnara Taiko group from the Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles, consisting of all third and fourth generation Japanese American Buddhists, gave an exciting performance of their Americanized version of the Japanese taiko music with hints of African rhythm and syncopation.


According to Sharon Yuasa from the Seattle Buddhist Church, the religious meaning of the Obon odori has been lost, yet there has been a renewed interest and involvement by the third and fourth generations in their Japanese cultural heritage which is really good to see.

Housing law protects families with kids


Housing discrimination against families with children is prohibited by the Seattle Open Housing Ordinance.


It is illegal to discriminate against parents and children by stating a preference in advertisements, setting special rates or rules for parents that are not applied equally to non-parents, stating that a place is not available when it actually is available, or otherwise misrepresenting the availability of housing.


The ordinance applies not only to apartment rentals, but also to single-family houses, condominiums, apartments of any size and quality, cottages, or houseboats, whether for sale, lease, or rent.


If you have been denied housing because a child lives with you, Seattle's Office of Women's Rights may be able to help you.

Scholarship application deadline is near


Students applying for scholarships under the National Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) program are reminded that applications for the freshman scholarships must be postmarked by March 15 and mailed to the local JACL chapter.


Through the generous support of JACL friends, the national scholarship committee has awarded over $90,000 since 1946. It will meet in early May to select national winners for 1980.


Upper division and graduate scholarships are due at national headquarters in San Francisco, postmarked by April 15. The undergraduate awards range from $250 to $1,000; graduate awards range from $250 to $5,000. Those eligible to apply are JACL members, their children, or any American of Japanese ancestry.


Freshman scholarships will be screened by the local JACL chapter. The local chapter will submit three nominees for the national competition. Applicants will be judged on a point system which takes into account the student's academic record, extracurricular activities, college entrance scores, autobiography, essay, one letter of application, and financial need if applicable.


Application forms may be obtained from any JACL chapter, JACL regional office, or the National Headquarters, 1765 Sutter Street, San Francisco, CA 94115.


Electrical contractors recruit women and minorities


Few women are employed in the electrical construction industry because they have been presented with ""an incomplete picture"" of job opportunities beginning in high school, according to the affirmative action director of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA).


Vanna H. Ishimaru, who has been working for NECA during the six months of the program's existence, has been helping recruit minorities and women into the electrical construction industry, meeting with minority and women's organizations.


""I'm trying to help contractors understand what their obligations are,"" she said. ""I help them handle their obligations through contacting these organizations.""


""Women until recently were not getting into the non-traditional trades,"" she said. ""We never realized it was something we could do."" The educational system at the high school level channeled women into home economics and typing classes, she said. ""We were presented with an incomplete picture and weren't told the type of careers we could get into -- even the pay and the opportunities involved.""


Ishimaru has recruited 170 minorities and women, over 50 per cent of whom have been women. She said that beginning April 1, contractors will be required to have 6.9 per cent female representation.


Women and minorities interested in electrical construction work in these areas should submit applications for the apprenticeship program by March 15. For more information contact Ishimaru at 284-2150.


Smithsonian Institute honors Jack Soo


The late Jack Soo was honored by the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. last October, according to On Location (Nov./Dec. 1979).


Known as Nick Yemana on ABC's police station comedy show, ""Barney Miller,"" Soo, a Japanese American, began his 37-year acting career as a Chinese nightclub entertainer in Cleveland. Born Goro Suzuki, Soo changed his name because of employment discrimination against Japanese.


Two things early in Soo's life affected his acting career, said the article. First, in 1934, at age 17, Soo won the first prize gold medal in an oratory contest, ""Why I'm proud to be an American,"" sponsored by the Japanese American Citizens League. Second, in 1942, Soo was sent to a Japanese internment camp in Topaz, Utah.


Artifacts were accepted from Soo's personal and professional life, including photos and props from the ""Barney Miller"" set, the coffee cup he was always clutching and his NYPD badge.

The door is slamming quietly on Asians and other minorities affected by admissions policy changes in the University of Washington's Equal Opportunity Program.


At a panel discussion on campus during the UW Asian Student Association's Asian Week, community leaders said changes have diluted the spirit of EOP.


Established in 1968 through community pressure, the program was conceived to increase access to the University for minorities and economically disadvantaged students.


Under the direction of Vice-President for Minority Affairs, Herman Lujan, a new admissions policy was instituted for fall, 1980. Designed to increase retention rates, the new policy included a two-year residency requirement, mandatory testing and interviews, and student contracts.


While Lujan is reconsidering some requirements in negotiations with the newly-formed Coalition for an Equal Educational Program, the changes have already decreased enrollment for next fall in the Chicano division by 60 to 70 percent, said Jesus Rodriquez, a representative of the multiethnic coalition.


The new policy, Rodriquez said, denies University access to students who do not show academic potential.


""It's changing the whole focus of EOP,"" Asian Division Director Jerry Shigaki said. ""We're recruiting students today that could basically get in through regular admissions.


""We have to ask ourselves, 'Are we really serving the Asian students that we really need to serve?'""


Through resignations and expressed dissatisfaction, Asian division counselors (who were not part of the panel discussion) have reacted to program changes.


""Changes have made me question the University's stance on 'educational opportunity,'"" counselor Adrienne Chan said in a letter to the Asian community. Chan, a counselor for seven years, wrote the letter in opposition to the program's new emphasis on retention.


""Whether a student completes one quarter, one year, or four years of schooling, that student has still profited,"" Chan said.


""Any student here for one year has learned a lot,"" former counselor Steve Aspiras added.


While supporting Aspiras and others who resigned in frustration over policy shifts, Chan said she decided to stay.


""I feel this is the way I can effectively advocate for students,"" she said.


Shigaki agreed. ""I took this job,"" he said, ""because I felt that I could make changes.


""If within a certain amount of time I felt I was not effective, I would look at quitting.""


Shigaki, who took over as Asian division director in February, said an abundance of paperwork, a shortage of staff, and low morale create an atmosphere of stress for counselors.


The Asian division's 1600 students comprise more than half of the 3000 minority students enrolled in the program. In the past, Asians have had the lowest dropout rate among EOP's five divisions. Last year, the Asian retention rate was about 68 percent, considerably higher than rates for blacks (44 percent), American Indians (35 percent), Chicanos (43 percent), and economically disadvantaged students (47 percent).


Despite the new requirements, Shigaki anticipates an increase in the number of Asian students next year.


Lack of staff growth to keep pace with student growth has created problems for the overflowing Asian division. The number of Asian division staff members has not increased since 1975, when only 700 Asian students were enrolled in the program. Of the division's five counseling positions, one is temporary through June and another is vacant after a counselor's resignation last month.


Already, counselor Edmon Lee said, the division feels the pinch. Outreach and participation in community affairs lagged this year, he said, as counselors spent more time on paperwork for students.


Aspiras shared Lee's frustrations.


""I was always pushing a lot of paper before I quit,"" said Aspiras, who resigned last fall. ""I wasn't servicing students. I had to be accountable to the University, not to the community.""


Without adequate staffing, Lee said, the division may have to shelve some services.


""It's not like we're asking for the world,"" Lee said, noting that the black division, which serves half as many students as the Asian division, is allotted the same number of counselors. ""Give us a full staff, and we'll make up the difference with blood, sweat and tears.""


The program is still needed, Shigaki said.


""If I were an incoming (minority) student, and I had a choice between EOP and no EOP, I would choose EOP,"" Shigaki said. ""It's a buffer.


""The reason there is a program is the reason there is discrimination and prejudice in society. It's difficult for Asian students to adjust. We don't get as much as we should from the campus and in a way it's not our fault.""


""The situation on campus hasn't changed that much,"" Lee agreed. ""Race relations haven't cooled down, but things are more covert. Racist attitudes have been under the table since the 70's.


""The U(niversity) is a tough situation. It's a step and a half for a minority to survive.""


Acknowledging that not all students agreed with them, two former EOP students backed the program.


""With a University that big, you get lost real quick,"" said Steve Woo, now a graduate student in public administration. ""EOP made it shrink a little quicker.""


Shigaki rejected the criticism, raised by an undergraduate in EOP, that the program ""spoonfeeds"" students.


""Asian students need someplace to be secure and start feeling good about themselves,"" Shigaki said. ""Once they feel secure, they can start seeking new and different horizons.


""There is a lot of potential to grow because of who you are.""


""You need some sort of support, something to tell you that you can do it,"" said Edwina Lapa, also a public administration graduate student.


Racism surfaces in ""little things,"" said Lapa, who transferred from the University of Hawaii as a junior.


""You come here and all of a sudden you're not as equal as the other person,"" Lapa said. ""I didn't have that problem in Hawaii.


""Maybe you just can't speak up in class because you're not used to being aggressive, but how can teachers understand if they don't come from that kind of culture?""

In the beginning, Seattle's desegregation plan was considered a success. School District officials pointed to Seattle as the first major city to desegregate its schools without a court order, and without riots or disturbances; and also for establishing ""option programs,"" specialized or enriched curricula to attract transfer students. The idea was to ""provide learning opportunities which take advantage of the cultural diversity and integration of the district's students.""


But it was not long before opposition to busing arose. A group called CiVIC (Citizens for Voluntary Integration Committee) placed an anti-busing measure, Initiative 350, on the November, 1978 ballot. It passed by a two to one margin, but was later struck down by the courts. The Seattle schools opposed the measure because ""it would make it legal for a school district to practice racial discrimination.""


Others expressed their opposition to busing in different ways, such as the phenomenon of ""white flight."" A study conducted by the School District's Student Placement Office concluded that many white students who lived in areas feeding to Cleveland, Rainier Beach, or Franklin high schools (all south end schools) no longer exist, having moved to private schools or out of the district entirely.


This exodus is partly responsible for the latest desegregation controversy: ""inequitable busing."" More students are being bused out of Seattle's south end schools than are being bused in, the imbalance being greatest at the high school level (816 out to 477 in).


Citing negative effects of inequitable busing (Franklin, for instance, has lost 50 course offerings in the past three years because of declining enrollment), south end parents and community leaders decided they could be ""more effective"" by working together. They formed SESCO (South End Seattle Community Organization), a group pressuring the school district to change its desegregation policies.


In addition to its basic demand of ""one in, one out"" busing, SESCO is lobbying the school board to open up its south end option programs to more minorities. Because the School District defines a segregated school as one with 63 or more percent minority students, the main thrust of its desegregation approach is dispersing concentrations of minorities. Thus, minority students who wish to enroll in option programs are, for the most part, not allowed to remain in the south end, but must bus out.


One minority enrollment case involves Sonny Kwan, whom the School district assigned to Rainier Beach. SESCO is supporting him in his efforts to attend Cleveland instead, despite the fact it exceeds district desegregation guidelines at 63.2 percent minority (as opposed to Rainier Beach's 51.8 percent). ""The fact that Cleveland exceeds the guidelines is the fault of the School District's busing policy,"" says SESCO's Bill Smith. ""Individual students should not have to pay for the School District's failures.""


Kwan, who says that his current dilemma is due to ""whites hav(ing) more rights than minorities,"" wants to attend Cleveland because of its Chinese language program and lion dance club. The Cleveland lion dance group is the last of its kind in the district; desegregation has dispersed Chinese students to such an extent that the clubs are no longer viable.


The lion dance problem raises an even more difficult point: that of ""cultural identity"" vs. desegregation. Although SESCO members have said that ""if (the School District) was busing in close to as many students as they are busing out, we wouldn't be losing the lion dances,"" it is hard to see how this could hold true, as incoming white students from the north end are unlikely to take much interest in Chinese lion dance clubs. SESCO's John Forbes replies that ""ethnic groups need not be completely dispersed. Large enough groups should be kept together so that their cultures can be preserved.""


On October 22, many SESCO members and television cameras . . . Superintendent of Schools Dr. David Moberly in his office, demanding a reply to their proposals. Moberly told the SESCO people to ""pay more attention to the positive things happening in our schools,"" and left after half an hour to join a school board meeting.


The action followed him there. SESCO member Fred Quarnstom made the following remarks to the board, ""The schools down south found they could create two unequal school systems to the disadvantage of the black race. In Seattle, you are being a little more subtle. You are oppressing all minority and socio-economic groups that live in southeast Seattle. Busing is the Supreme Court's cure for segregated schools in the South, and Seattle is now using busing as a tool to restrict and oppress our minority students and prevent them from an equal education.


""Why are our minority students being denied special programs? Could it be because someone feels they do not deserve the same opportunity as majority students? Is it because we are a racially integrated community? Is it because our neighborhoods have many low income families? Could it be because our neighborhoods have many single parent families who are too busy trying to survive to come out to meetings like this and make noise? Is it because we have many mixed families?


""This meeting today is useless. The only chance we have is to hope that the media pick this up and embarrass you into providing an equal education for all the students of Seattle.""


Immediately after Quarnstom completed his statement, board president Dorothy Hollingsworth announced a tenminute recess. SESCO members objected, accusing the board of stalling so ""that the cameras would leave, and we would get tired."" The session ended with SESCO members getting up and shouting, ""we want this issue resolved now!"" as board members walked out of the room.


The School District's solution to the inequitable busing problem lies with closing Lincoln and Queen Anne high schools by next summer. The students who formerly attended those schools would be bused south, easing the busing imbalance.


Citing population loss, declines in property values, and general neighborhood deterioration, parents and community leaders in the Wallingford area, where Lincoln High School is located, are working together to block the District's plan. They may eventually sue to keep their school open, which could result in a lengthy court battle.

On a dismal Seattle day when umbrellas go up, hairstyles go flat, and eyes peer from deep inside collars and the whole world seems ash colored, a la St. Helens, I headed toward Tashiro Hardware, a family business of 63 years and located on the International District's fringes at Third and Yesler.


I surveyed Tashiro's huge storefront window, which displayed a curious mixture of items from electric works to home and garden tools and fishing gear.


Inside, the store was warm, and old; one of those rare places of business that feel naturally ""homey"". The atmospheric gloom subsided as I browsed down aisles of Asian and western merchandise.


Soon another escaping from the drizzle walked briskly in, greeted a customer by name, and turned to me. We went upstairs to a comfortably cluttered office, and I sat down to listen to 70 years of history from Billee Tashiro Yoshioka. Mrs. Yoshioka (Shizuko, but everyone calls her Billee), who with husband Juro now runs Tashiro Hardware, talked of how it all began.


Billee's father, Kanjiro, sailed from Shimaneken Hamada, Japan, for Seattle in 1907. He was enticed by his youngest brother who, according to Billee, ""painted glowing pictures"" of America, and by other relatives who said ""it was such a wonderful country, everybody makes a grand bunch of money."" Kanjiro left behind a hardware store, as well as a wife, Toshi (who followed the next year), to make his fortune in a new land.


But in Seattle, Kanjiro was not destined to get-rich-quick, and 10 years of odd jobs from 1907-1917 awaited him. Billee recounted the varied employment: pinsetter at a bowling alley, dishwasher, clean-up man at the old Moore Theatre. Mrs. Tashiro, meanwhile, became a seamstress.


In 1917, Kanjiro leased the spot on Third and Yesler, specializing Billee said, in ""Japanese carpenter tools."" The venture was not successful. ""People just didn't understand it (the carpenter wares); it looked so primitive."" So Kanjiro Americanized his line of goods, adding fishing tackles, gardening tools, cutlery, paints, and motors. But he always wished to retain a mixture of Asian and American goods (which explains the front window).


During wartime, the Tashiros had to relocate with other west coast Japanese. Prices were slashed, and the store was ""mobbed"" by bargain hunters at the evacuation sale. Leftover merchandise was put into storage, and the family was incarcerated from 1942-1946.


Billee described her father as ""a sprightly old man,"" which might be an understatement. After the war, the space at Third and Yesler was still available, and Kanjiro, at 71, decided it was time to get back into business: ""He said he was going to open the store again. We said no, you just can't do it,"" Billee said.


But Kanjiro did do it -- in a big way. Besides the original space, he leased the Donut House on his south side, and to the north, the Wonder Cafe, a barber shop, a grocery store, and an airline office. By 1951, the Tashiros would own the building.


When the store reopened, it was ""mobbed"" again, said Billee, this time by people enthusiastic for the pre-war goods that had been in storage. And, ironically, the Japanese carpenter tools that Kanjiro originally had wished to promote became popular.


George Nakashima, a world-famous furniture designer, first popularized the tools, said Billee, but he probably was not the only source. ""My theory is that some of the soldiers must have brought back some of these Japanese carpenter tools from Japan. Now they're so popular we have mail orders for them."" Kanjiro, who died in 1971 at 96, would be proud. Tashiro Hardware is now a major northwest distributor of the tools, though fishing gear is the store's most popular item.


The section of the store devoted to tackle offers everything from depth finders and motors to staples such as bait, hooks, and sinkers. Large green and white nets festoon the walls and front window, rubberized rain gears line the walls, and racks of fishing rods point skyward.


Kanjiro Tashiro was involved with business until his death at age 96. Four years short of 100, he was an active member of the ""Hyaku Do Kau Club"", a Japanese group of issei who believed they would work until they were 100. He would sit in his rocking chair in the store, says Billee, sometimes snoozing, and he loved seeing friends. The tradition of friendship has carried on.


Billee and husband Juro are on a name-to-name basis with many old customers, ""Kind of an owner-to-customer deal,"" Billee, said. She described Tashiro as an ""old-fashioned store where service is given."" Long time customers feel ""safe"" there, and ask advice for everything from fishing to cold remedies.


It is the friends they have made over the years that make Tashiro Hardware a . . . place for the Yoshiokas to work. In terms of rewards from the hardware business, Billee declared ""The people are most enjoyable.""

A main task of IDEC is to be among the people. A patrol medic spends much of his time on the streets of the International District. While walking a beat, you get to know all the people of the community. You know who to watch out for. The long hours of training at IDEC pay off when you're on your own.


Once you're on the street, you learn from experience. You have to know what's happening around you. Keep your eyes moving; know where the closest phone is; be aware of any hazards around you; keep your radio tuned in and just stay alert. Expect the unexpected. Being aware and alert helps you deal with the shootings, assaults, bar room fights, stabbings, fires and other daily occurrences.


The night air is cold and icy. While on patrol, you see a large figure down the block from you. As you get closer you make out who it is. A sigh of relief as you proceed towards the figure. The figure just stands there on the corner like a rock. As you come near him, he shouts out, ""Hey kid, you got a call?"" Smiling, you reply, ""Not yet."" Who is this figure? He's our ""Blue Knight,"" the old cop on the beat. Cops in the International District on night shift are real pros. When you run into problems during an emergency, you can always count on them.


Down the block, you can make out a person in a wheel chair. You wonder why anyone is out on a chilly night like this. Glancing at your watch you see that it's past 1 a.m. As you approach, you notice that he is asleep in a wheel chair next to a vent of a building. As you wake him to see how he is, he nearly jumps at your throat! When he notices your uniform, he calms down. But what are you supposed to do with a handicapped person who is broke and it's 1 a.m. on a weekend? There wasn't much that we could do.


After a while you see so many people like this on the streets that you wonder why things like this happen. It's part of the International District that you will have to admit exists. Society calls them bums and drunks, but it's these people whom IDEC medics have to put their lives on the line for.


The night is still young. You see the district wind down another day. The bars will soon close. Walking down King Street, you notice a person walking up the block with a strange look on his face. You step back a little to give him room. But when you're up against a brick wall, there isn't much room. So the guy attempts to knock you down. You ask him, ""What's your problem tonight?"" He turns and makes a gesture like he's going for a gun. He then threatens to blow your head off and challenges you. As you back off from him, he swears at you while trying to spit on your uniform. You give him plenty of room, and he finally gives up trying to pick a fight and shouts ""Chink,"" then continues on his way.


Continuing on patrol, you pass some young brothers, and one of them says, ""Hey, Halloween is over."" They go laughing and walking up the street. You ignore them and continue your beat. Glancing at your watch again, you see it's past 2 a.m. and start home.


All incidents are true.

We wish all a safe and happy Lunar New Year. IDEC is celebrating its 12th Lunar Year this month. Aid stations, community service classes and safety courses will continue as usual throughout the year.


IDEC has a new dispatcher, Ben Ng. Mr. Eng will be working daily. He can speak Toisanese and Cantonese. More dispatchers are badly needed. Please write us in care of this newspaper.


IDEC medics were kept busy in early February. Fire Department and IDEC medies responded to numerous fires along Main Street. First, there was a reported room fire on the ninth floor of the Downtowner Apartments. After units arrived on the fire floor, they found that someone had burned their food.


Police responded to a call of a man with a gun in a local bar. Police arrived and took control of the scene. There were no injuries. Safety reminders: To stop bleeding, put direct pressure over the wound; then raise the general area of the wound, then if known, apply pressure to the nearest area where a vein or artery is closest to the bone (for example, if your forearm is bleeding, put pressure to the inside of the upper arm).


Fire extinguishers are made in three basic types. Class A is for common burning items such as wood products and clothes. Class B is for burning liquids such as gas, oil and alcohol. Class C is for electrical fires such as a fuse box or appliance. Know how to operate your fire extinguisher properly, using the wrong type of extinguisher on a fire can be hazardous. It can kill you. Most fire extinguishers are simple. Pull the pin, get below the smoke, aim and press down the handle, sweep the area of the fire at the base. Call the proper emergency number for your area. For more information, go to your local fire station or contact IDEC for a firewatch class.


If you need help call us or the fire department. Our number is 623-3321, or call 911.

For the last nine years, Edmon Lee was part of the University of Washington's Educational Opportunity Program (EOP). He was an EOP student, an EOP recruiter, and for the last five and one-half years, an EOP counselor in the Asian Student Division. Last month, Lee resigned from his position at the University.


In his August 11 resignation letter to Dr. Herman Lujan, Vice President for the Office of Minority Affairs (which administers the EOP), Lee stated, ""(Y)ou are well aware of the differences we share as they relate to the new EOP admissions policy, support for increased staffing in the Asian Pacific American Division and the character of your administrative style. These issues have had their definite impact upon my desire to seek meaningful employment elsewhere.""


In 1971, Lee decided to become involved with the program as a student because he was getting ""D's, close to probation, and worried about flunking."" He said, ""If it wasn't for the EOP staff, I wouldn't have made it through college. Their personal support became very important to me. I remember the hassles trying to get into the School of Urban Planning. At that time, Asians were not being considered as minorities by Urban Planning. We had meetings with those folks to sensitize them to Asians. Larry Flores was my counselor then and he went to those meetings. He wrote letters, made calls, and really followed through on my behalf. Today, because of the increased numbers of students and lack of staff, we just don't have the time to give that type of support for students.""


Edmon became a counselor in 1974 because he ""had the opportunity to give back what I got.""


According to Edmon, when he first became a counselor, the primary focus of the program was admissions and growth. He recalls, ""We wanted to get more Asians into the program. I think that we were admitting 70 percent of the Asians who applied which I didn't think was enough."" Ninety percent admission rate should have been the goal. But admissions and growth weren't the only goals. Retention of students through counseling and financial aid was always our objective, and it bothers me that Dr. Lujan says we weren't doing that in the past.""


Gradually, the emphasis of EOP changed. Edmon recalled that ""around 1977-1978, we began to change our way of thinking. The emphasis changed from sheer numbers to reaching target populations. We were trying to get more Filipinos and more Group B students into the program. (Group B students had significant educational deficiencies while Group A students either had minor educational deficiencies or could have been admitted through regular admissions). We wanted to focus on Asians who had been traditionally excluded from going to college.""


He added, ""Before we had the time to sit on affirmative action committees on various departments at the UW. We had some say in determining departmental policies to make the campus aware and sensitive of Asians. We can't do that now. For example, the School of Business doesn't really consider Asians as minorities. Although Japanese and Chinese do get admitted into that school, do you really think that Filipinos and Samoans are represented in the school?""


By 1978, adequate staffing was becoming a problem in the Asian Student Division. When Lee first started as a counselor in 1974, there were four counselors serving 746 students or a student/counselor ratio of 189:1. By 1979, the number of Asian students had grown to approximately 1,400 students with five counselors. However, the creation of the Academic Advising Unit meant the loss of one counselor from each division. Asian students now represented one-half of all students in the EOP. Four counselors were available to handle the students, a student/counselor ratio of almost 350:1. For 1980-1981, 1,700 Asian students have been anticipated.


Lee said, ""In 1978, Larry Flores wrote a memo predicting the increase in students which would justify additional staffing in our office. Since then, we have made repeated requests for additional staffing to deal with the increase in numbers. But the response from Dr. Lujan's office has been pretty negative. I believe that Dr. Lujan has a stereotypical vision that Asian students don't need EOP services. But Asian students make up 50 percent of the entire program, and they represent the largest number of students who use programs such as the tutorials and the pre-registration workshops. On the one hand, he says that Asians don't need our services. But at the same time, he tells us to recruit more Asians because the budget for the office is tied into how many students are in the program.""


Lee continued, ""It was frustrating. Dr. Lujan told us there was no money in the budget to fund additional staff. Yet, at the same time, he was advertising for an additional assistant vice president's position in his office.


""When Dr. Lujan first came to the University,"" Edmon remembered, ""everything was cool. But after a while, I could see there were going to be problems. There's been continual disagreement over his admissions policy. I think he's turning the wrong corner on focusing primarily on retention of students as his goal for admissions. He has a view that the problems in retention of students are all academically related. I think that he believes that we have been admitting Asians of 'low academic quality.' But the problems in retention are not solely based on academics; there are also cultural reasons, personal reasons, and financial reasons. We did some withdrawal spot studies that showed a high correlation between financial problems and academic problems. Lujan's plan only speaks to the academic. People who have to work their way through school don't have as much time to study as people who can get money from their parents.""


Lee believes that ""there should be emphasis on developing a financial aid game plan. That's where the problems are. By admitting only the 'cream of the crop,' you won't need as many supportive services. Every student should graduate. I'd be a fool to say otherwise; but this new admissions policy would be developed at the expense of who? The very people which EOP is designed for.""


In response to Lee's resignation, Dr. Herman Lujan said, ""Ed has been a major assistant in the Asian Division, and I'm really sorry to see him go. I honestly believe that his main reason for quitting was because he had another job opportunity. (Lee now works for the Operation Improvement Foundation). He has a Master's degree, and I think he is ready to assume some major administrative responsibilities.


Dr. Lujan added, ""We've had our differences in the past but Ed was always professional and had model behavior even in times of stress. I believe that Ed favors an open admissions policy but the University doesn't have one, and I'm constrained by that. I recognize the problems of staffing. Despite a $100,000 deficit in our budget, I have gone ahead and funded a position for this year. In addition, I've asked Jerry Shigaki to get together with the Asian faculty to find other means for additional staff, specifically, using advanced graduate students. I think that shows some support for the division. As for Ed's position, we have every intention of replacing him with a permanent counselor.""


He concluded, ""I haven't said this about all the people who have resigned or left the program, but I have nothing but the highest respect for Edmon Lee.""

It's summertime, the best time of the year for the ""street people."" The weather is warm and the outdoors isn't so hard on the people with no place else to go. They are the crazies, the bums, and the drunks, which our society tries to sweep under the carpet. But they do exist -- in the alleys, on the doorsteps, on the benches, and under the freeways.


Street people always seem to follow the hookers to the same places. The District is no exception. The people who live in the streets are found downtown, not in Bellevue or Mercer Island, not even on Beacon Hill. The District has served as a temporary home for the street people because there is no other place to go.


Whether they are crazy or drunk, they are out on the streets. The drunks make periodic trips to the drunk tank only to be released to get drunk again. The crazies have no one looking after them. For the general public, they are somebody else's problem. Shoppers and restaurant goers walk by them, walk around them and see through them as if they weren't there. Merchants want to get rid of them. Little kids try to make fun of them.


For the most part, the drunks and winos don't bother anybody unless the bottle's dry. They need the cash to get the stash, begging change from the three-piece suits that pass by. Even the price of Thunderbird has gone up.


The crazies, on the other hand, whether consciously or not, do bother people. It may be their way to get back at society. They are living in a completely different world than the rest of us. Unlike the drunks and winos who act alike, the crazies stick out more so because of their bizarre behavior. It's really hard to imagine that they always acted that way.


For example, one figure that everybody has seen in the District is a big, hulking figure who moves slowly, taking long, carefully placed steps, as he lumbers up and down the streets, muttering death curses to people who manage to catch his eye. Now and then, he will stop, raise his fist, and yell at people.


Another figure well known in the District who appears around springtime is the old black woman, one shopping bag under arm, swinging an umbrella with the other, who preaches the Lord on street corners. All day, she walks up and down Jackson Street preaching to everyone, but to no one in particular.


These folks end up in the District because there really is no place else to go. But there are thousands of such people, crazies and drunks, on the streets, most of whom stay around the downtown area.


The downtown area, however, is undergoing changes. There are proposals to redevelop downtown, particularly the waterfront area, where many of the street people find their temporary havens in the alleys, doorways, and cubbyholes. But again, society is treating the street people as if they didn't exist.


When people talk about redevelopment, what they really mean is that they wish to clean up a run-down, deteriorating area. The proposals presented by the downtown developers are intended for the benefit of the business community. Let's clean up the waterfront area so more people will shop there. The alleys, doorways, and cubbyholes must be lighted, cleaned up, and polished.


Proposals by these developers do include housing but there is no provision for the street people. The street people must find some other place to stay. They are bad for business and will be driven out. It doesn't matter to these developers where the street people will go. The street people will be somebody else's problem.


So where are all the street people going to go? It's not as if they will suddenly get up and disappear. The term ""skid row"" originated in Seattle, at the foot of Yesler during it's pioneer logging days. (Logs would be skidded down Yesler to the waterfront, the area where the drunks and crazies hung out.) The street people will find some place.


It is likely they will end up in the International District, along with as many low-income folks that available housing in the District can support. The District is the only area in the city which is obtaining low-income housing. Other areas of the city are not actively pursuing low-income housing. It is conceivable that downtown development will drive all the drunks and crazies to the District. After all, the District has always been a convenient dumping ground for people and things not wanted in other parts of the city.


Of course, not all ""street people"" are crazy or drunk. Those people are able to articulate their concerns. It's the crazies and drunks who have no one to represent them. They will go to a place where they will stay until they get kicked out. They may be kicked out of the downtown area.


The drunks and crazies may be somebody else's problem. They become ours.

Chosen the best big band in the world by Downbeat magazine critics and readers polls in 1979 and 1980 and by Playboy magazine in 1980, the Akiyoshi/Tabackin Big Band recently opened a new, major jazz series at the University of Washington.


Toshiko Akiyoshi, recognized as one of the best composer/arrangers in Downbeat polls, co-leads the band with her husband, Lew Tabackin.


Akiyoshi wants to leave her mark in jazz history. She is one of the first women in jazz to have composed and arranged an entire library of music to perform in her band. ""I consider the band as an extension of me,"" said Akiyoshi. ""The band is me. If I get better, the band gets better.""


""When you do something for the first time,"" she said, ""there's always pressure,"" commenting on being an Asian woman in the jazz world. ""If I were a man and I wrote 10 good compositions out of 50,"" she said, ""I would be a pretty good writer, I will gain recognition. Being a woman and non-American, if I have 50 tunes, they all have to meet a certain level. It puts pressure on me and I have to produce something. I put my standards very high and I do the same for others.""


Born and raised in Manchuria, Akiyoshi combines both Asian and western influences in some of her compositions. ""I decided that rather than thinking of my heritage as negative, I would think of it as positive,"" said Akiyoshi.


Minimata, a Japanese fishing village whose people were stricken by mercury poisoning, inspired Akiyoshi to write a 21-minute suite for the band's Insights album. Insights, released in 1976, won Japan's Swing Journal award as album of the year in competition with 1300 albums.


Although ""I cannot change the world,"" Akiyoshi says her role, her contribution to world change, is to record what happened through music. ""Like a journalist writing a record of what happened, because I'm a jazz player, I record that with jazz music.


""There are so many things done in which the title will say something political and perhaps the music will have no meaning, so I try to write music which will have conviction. When people hear it, they can feel it.""


The individual and free expression in jazz is universal, making it popular in Europe and Japan. ""It's not like classical music where it recreates what an old master has written,"" Akiyoshi said. ""We try to create something spontaneously. Listening to it, you're a part of it. That's a different kind of experience. For the listener, it's like getting to know a person.""


The Akiyoshi/Tabackin band has performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival, the Kool Jazz Festival, the Newport Jazz Festival, Ojai Music Festival, Berkeley Jazz Festival and in concert tours throughout the United States and far east.

Residents from the Downtowner Apartments, a HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) subsidized low-income housing project, came to the International District Housing Alliance (IDHA) office to question the legality of a recent rent increase by the owners. Andy Mizuki of IDHA said, ""Preliminary investigation has revealed that the rent increase notices given to tenants were not legal.""


Handwritten notices on scraps of paper stated the expected amount of rent and an additional charge for furniture rent. Tenants received these notices 10 days prior to the effective rent increase rate on June 1.


According to HUD Regulations Title 24, Chapter IV, Part 401.2, ""At least 30 days before filing an application with HUD for an increase in the maximum permissible rents, the mortgager shall notify the tenants of the proposed rent increase. Copies of such notice shall be: a) delivered directly or by mail to each tenant; or b) posted in at least 3 conspicuous places ...""


The notice must say in effect, ""Take notice that on (date) we plan to file an application for approval of an increase ... (with HUD). The proposed increase is needed for the following reasons (list 3). Copies of the materials that we intend to submit to HUD in support of our application will be available during normal business hours at (address) for a period of 30 days ... (and) tenants may submit written comments on the proposed rent increase ...""


Mizuki said that one tenant was refused access to the material the management submitted to HUD stating reasons for the rent increase. The Downtowner had only one notice located in the lobby, according to one tenant. He, like the others to be mentioned, wished to remain anonymous.


Another tenant said that he paid the rent increase rate. The management, however, said it has not been collecting any additional rent since the rent increase has not yet been approved by HUD. Martin Seelig, owner of the Downtowner with his brother Howard, said that he expected to hear from HUD in September. He said the rent increase will help to cover the ""increasing operational expenses.""


The Downtowner is a 75-year-old building located in the outskirts of the International District. It was remodelled two years ago and was converted from a hotel to low-income housing through a subsidy by HUD. It can house up to 240 tenants. Some have bedrooms; others are studios. The furniture is rented to the tenants.


One tenant wrote an anonymous letter dated July 11 to IDHA, and explained, ""... the furniture included is one dining table, two plastic chairs, one 'Danish style' chair, one large dresser, one nitestand and one beat-up box spring and mattress. All the furniture is very cheap and shoddy and has been here for years.""


The writer of the letter also complained, ""The old men have the prostitutes and run-aways come here and although the guards try to keep them out, they can't keep all of them out."" Seelig explained that there are police for two nights and a Burns security guard for the rest of the week and that the management staff is present during the day. He said that only tenants and visitors of tenants are allowed in the building.


Some tenants said that they do not want to leave their apartments at night because they feel it is unsafe. Fights which sometimes lead to shootings occur. On July 19, a man was shot and killed in his apartment. One tenant recalled the incident. ""They were arguing at two or three in the morning. Then I heard a bang. It sounded like a fire-cracker."" He suggested that the guards patrol the floors rather than staying down in the lobby and ""don't just let anyone in.""


Most of the tenants are ""unstable"" or alcoholics, according to Mizuki. He said that the Downtowner has problems with security, maintenance and residents considered undesirable which should not have been accepted, reflecting mismanagement. The IDHA hopes to improve the living conditions and also roll back the rent to what it was before the June 1st increase by filing a complaint to HUD on behalf of the tenants. Mizuki said that IDHA wants the public to be aware of the ""misuse of taxpayers' money.""

Kung Hey Fat Choy! will fill the air when Chinese New Year is celebrated February 16.


Traditionally, Chinese New Year preparations began one month in advance with festivities lasting a full month after New Year's Day. The Chinese began by cleaning their homes thoroughly to rid them of the past year's bad luck. New clothes were sewn and traditional foods were prepared.


Excitement filled the air as young and old stayed up on New Year's Eve to welcome the new year and say goodbye to the old year. Ancestors were revered or worshipped. Children were given red envelopes stuffed with new bills to wish them good fortune. Families set out to wish friends a Happy New Year, being careful to speak only good things, as everything one says or does is symbolic of the 364 days to come.


The Chinese believe the year you are born in influences your character. Each year is assigned one of twelve animals. No one is certain how these twelve animals were selected. One old tale speaks of a king in China who invited the animals in his kingdom to share in the New Year's celebration. Twelve animals came. First the rat came. Then the ox, followed by tiger, hare, dragon, serpent, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and finally boar. The king named a year for each of the animals.


1980 is the Year of the Monkey People born under the sign of the monkey are considered geniuses of the animal zodiac, sometimes much too clever for their own good. They are achievers, known for their immense good humor and deep desire for knowledge. They quickly solve difficult problems and are adept at handling finances. They go after goals with great enthusiasm but are easily bored. If all goes well the monkey can become famous, but if there are too many obstacles the monkey will leave a project unfinished and move on to something else. Monkeys are talented, have good memories and are often the life of the party after everyone else has gone home. The cycle's most talented flirt prefers travel and adventure and moves towards careers in writing, teaching or advertising. The monkey is compatible with the dragon or rat, but should avoid the tiger.


For more information on the Year of the Monkey, visit the Wing Luke Memorial Museum at 414 8th S. And while you're in the International District, watch for traditional Chinese New Year activities.

Greg Ptucha, City staffperson for the International Special Review District Board, told The Examiner earlier this month he will resign his position effective March 3.


Ptucha divided his time between staffing the District Board and the Pioneer Square Special Review Board. He had been on the job since early November, 1978. ""I didn't want to deal with the stress anymore,"" he said. ""I knew that I needed to quit. It was literally for my sense of sanity.""


During Ptucha's term, the International District Board, charged with approving development in the International District, was at the center of stormy community controversies which revealed bitter divisions between the Chinese ""King Street Business-persons"" and social service agency advocates such as Inter*Im. For example, the City invalidated the May 31 Review Board election because of complaints of voting irregularities, a high point of tension between groups in the community. Ptucha, as a representative of the City, was caught in the middle.


""I like the District a lot,"" he said. ""I have a high reverence for it. At the same time, for various cultural and political reasons, there is so much factionalism that people are not accomplishing as a whole what the community is capable of achieving.


""A lot of the frustrations of my job came from just pushing paper. The hardest problem was having the time to prepare good staff reports which are a good way to educate the Board about what was going on.""


Ptucha said the Board members, serving voluntarily, generally already have fulltime jobs and are involved in ""God knows how many community groups,"" leaving little time to contribute to the Review Board.


The Board, comprised of five members elected by the community and two appointed by the Mayor, meets every other week to consider development proposals in the District. Ptucha recommended that four members be elected and three be appointed. Board members need to be acquainted with how decisions are made in City government, know a little about community politics and have a ""refined sense of aesthetics,"" he said.


Ptucha's successor will be chosen after the City advertises for the position, which may take some time, Ptucha said. In any case, Ptucha said he has doubts about the worth of the position. ""It's like adding to the bureaucracy to help the community get through the bureaucracy, which is sort of dumb.""


The Review Board staffperson needs to be ""very strong and someone with commitment,"" Ptucha said. ""You can play it as pushing paper and you're going to be a good little bureaucrat and continue to rake in good bucks, but to be able to achieve significant change, you need to be committed and put in the extra time to make it work.""


Ptucha said Pioneer Square and the District ""both suffer from the same problem of attitude toward property ownership."" Owners are unwilling to rehabilitate their property, he said. ""In the long term, it's a pretty bankrupt policy.""


But he added, ""An interesting contrast is the fact that the City administration has a lot of respect and fear for what the I.D. community wants and might be pissed off about. I've seen a lot of time put into Pioneer Square and less response from the City. That's because Pioneer Square was (former Mayor) Wes Uhlman's baby.""


Ptucha criticized the barren exterior of the recently completed low-income housing project on Main Street, the Imperial House. Many people in the community have said the exterior of the Imperial House is an eyesore. Because of a City Building Department ""screw-up,"" Ptucha said, the building has not turned out the way the Review Board expected when the design was approved. ""It would never be anything more than mediocre,"" Ptucha said of the building's appearance. ""But it originally had a more sophisticated mediocrity. If that's allowed to remain unchanged, you might as well abolish the Board. You're going to have an Imperial House on every block.


Ptucha said he is now thinking about becoming an architect or cab driver.


Any parting words?


""I hope to one day disco with Ruby Chow,"" he said jokingly.

""A total of 48 buildings, resulting from expected Downtown development, will replace 950,000 square feet of existing space, or 1,875 Apartment or hotel units....""


""OPE study, March 81""


In August 1980, the Seattle City Council passed the nation's first Housing. Preservation Ordinance (HPO) which was aimed at preserving the scarce and precious affordable housing, particularly in areas most vulnerable to demolitions of housing to make way for the kind of development projected above. Less than a year into operation; there is a move underway to scuttle the ""heart"" out of the ordinance.


What is the HPO and how does it work?


The law requires any developer who wishes to tear down structurally sound housing to pay a sliding fee unless he or she builds replacement housing. There is no fee if the developer decides instead to move the housing to another site. A relocation payment of $1,000 per tenant is also required by the new law. A few cases have arisen in which small business or home owners found the fee prohibitive. Most of these cases have arisen in single-family homes and in lower density areas (downtown neighborhoods such as the International District are in high density areas). Councilmember Michael Hildt has proposed Several amendments to the HPO one of which would exempt duplexes or single family homes of two or less. However, Councilmembers George Benson and Dolores Sibonga have something else in mind. They would like to wipe out the fee clause entirely and increase the relocation fee from $1,000 to $2,000. This would essentially gut the heart out of the ordinance. Many individuals are concerned about Hildt's proposed exemption of single family homes because over half of all demolitions occurring in 1977 and 1978 were either single family homes or housing in non-residential zones. But in the face of the Benson/Sibonga amendment, we of course cannot support wiping out the fee structure altogether.


Why are the fees necessary?


The sliding fee is the ""meat"" of the ordinance. Without it, demolition of low and moderate income housing continues at a time when even the City acknowledges that over 35,000 households are in need of housing financial assistance and that only 4 percent of the housing need are being met by public and private efforts.


The real issue is, do residents who live in neighborhoods have the right to stay in the face of bulldozers that would rather have a 60 floor office building? Does the City have the responsibility to intervene in this situation to ensure that this city remains ""livable"" for all income and age levels? Of course the answer is yes. Without public policy such as the HPO, affordable housing will not be preserved.


Having established the need for such a public law, the next question is -- has the HPO worked? Is the law a viable one and not the concoction of a few activists who managed to persuade five Councilmembers ""off guard"" to vote for the HPO back in August, 1980?


The HPO has only been in operation for nine months and is ""in need of some repair,"" according to Hildt. Of course it is too soon to assess its full merits without at least a trial period of a couple of years. But early figures show that the HPO is affecting demolitions in this city. An average of 23 demolitions were occurring prior to the HPO's passage with only an average of 14 demolitions per month after its passage. Moreover, the HPO just hasn't had the chilling effect developers feared of driving them out of the city to build elsewhere. Multi-family new construction or conversions averaged 207 per month after the HPO's passage and 188 per month prior to its passage! Early figures from Councilmember Hildt's office indicates less than a 10 percent reduction in total building permits from 1979 to 1980 and less than a 1 percent difference in commercial construction and multi-family construction respectively. There was a decrease in single family construction (down from 37 average to 14 average per month) after the HPO.


It is hoped that Hildt's amendment will address this problem. While certainly these figures cannot be totally conclusive, has the ordinance had such a dramatic negative impact to warrant a repeal with less than nine months into its operation?


Certainly the HPO cannot be seen in isolation: from inflation (with elderly paying 30-50 percent of incomes for rent) to the impact of high interest rates (or solely depending upon the private industry to build affordable housing and the Reagan game plan to cut housing financing and federal subsidy programs). While real estate industry spokespersons lament, ""we have too much regulation and red tape on us! First they wanted a just cause eviction protection law then the HPO, and what next?"" Typical scare tactics. Quite simple, we must protect our livability in the absence of federal and state support thanks to the new Republican administration.


Increasingly, local city government must take the lead in ensuring our city continues on a path of sane planning to keep our elderly living in the neighborhoods where they belong. If the big real estate industry has its own way, as it has had for decades, there will be no tomorrow.

Compiled by International District Emergency Center


Each year IDEC medics look forward to end of summer. This year was no exception. Incidents resulting from violence kept medics very busy the past few weeks.


A young woman was assaulted and beaten by two people while walking down a street. Medics treated the woman and called in the Seattle Police Department to assist in finding the assailants Police are also looking into the case of a man who was the victim of a large slash wound to his chest.


Another afternoon, a male was pushed down and robbed of $20. He was sent to the hospital with a head injury.


Early one morning, medics responded to a stabbing in a District park. We found a man who had been beaten and robbed by several people. He had a leg wound and possible tracture.


Several traffic accidents occurred in the area. keeping IDEC medics busy. Two unusual accidents occurred at the 9th and Dearborn intersection. (This intersection has some of the most unusual accidents in the area.) In the first accident, a man's brakes went out coming off 1-5. He hit a fence head on, turning the car around 360 degrees. The small foreign car was totaled, along with a three-wheel scooter and a tractor. The man was sent to the hospital with numerous injuries.


The second accident at this intersection involved a flat bed truck that did a 180 degree turn and tipped over, dumping its load of car batteries. Traffic was blocked for some time. A large domestic automobile then ran into a motorcycle with two people aboard. Both bikers were sent to the hospital with numerous injuries.


A man was found in a District hotel. He had fallen three days prior to calling for help and was sent to the hospital with possible rib fractures. It is common to find people who could have called for help but didn't since there were no phones or emergency pull cords. IDEC medics are very tired of seeing this.


A woman on Maynard Ave. broke out windows of a hotel and started throwing items out the window. She had threatened to jump. Police and fire units responded along with IDEC. She was later pulled back into her room.


IDEC medics responded to a call to check on a man in a room. Upon arriving medics found a man who had earlier died. If you are unsure of what is wrong with a person, please do not hesitate to call us for help. We would rather get there early than later. If you find someone who has been dead for some time, call the SPD and do not touch anything.


There has been reported damage done to the ID Garden and property. The Greenhouse, built by community workers and residents, was damaged, IDEC encourages any resident seeing damage being done to the Garden to call the police (or Inter*Im during normal working hours). IDEC will continue to patrol the area and the police have been notified also.


In these times of cut backs, IDEC is also in a bind. But cutting back from little leaves nothing. So we are trying to do more with less. As our medical supplies diminish, we put some kits out of service and break others up to re-supply main kits. But at no time will our service be cut back. So if our kits and uniforms begin to look a bit shaky, it's because we are putting all our efforts into paying bills.


IDEC will be training Asian high school youth during the fall and winter season by way of the public schools training program. Contact your school counselor for the proper forms. Or if you wish to volunteer, you can contact us by writing in care of the International Examiner.

Renovating the Bush Hotel and creating a community center has been a challenging assignment, explained Architect Steve Arai. The assignment was to design a community center to house low-income residents, social service agencies, commercial businesses, and community center facilities, while preserving the historical architecture of the Bush Hotel.


Because the hotel, built in 1916, ""is an old building,"" said Arai, ""there were a number of code-related problems and structural problems."" Out-of-town specialists were called in for some complex problems. Also, the building was to ""change usage."" It would not just be a hotel for housing, but would expand its function to include community and commercial usage. This required major reconstruction of some parts of the building.


Arai described the remodeling objectives for the low-income housing units: ""The thought was that the present tenants in the building were the real residents of the community and they were obviously low-income. (Our goal) was to make the hotel safe and comfortable -- not pretty, new, or slick."" Thus, ""deferred maintenance"" work was done to housing-floors (floors 3-6). For each room, this means installing new, reinforced double doors, new locks, peep holes and firesprinklers, painting walls, laying new carpets, and fixing leaky ceilings and faulty plumbing. Every floor has a public phone and bathroom with handicapped access. Future plans include laundry rooms, with washer and dryer, to be put on two floors.


Construction work by General Contractor Takisaki-Clark, Joint Venture, has reduced the number of housing units. Originally, the hotel had 260 rooms and the project's housing-floors had 52 rooms per floor. During renovation, many rooms were combined and enlarged, and those on the 2nd floor were demolished to make office space. Now the hotel has 156 rentals and the four housing-floors have 39 rooms per floor (35 single-room units and 4 Section 8 apartments). There are many types of housing units: 105 single-room (SRO's) housing units (weekly and monthly rentals), 35 SRO's for transients (daily rentals), and 16 Section 8 apartments (rent-subsidized apartments containing 1 bedroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom). One-third of the units have private baths and half of the units have phones. Julia Laranang, Public Authority office manager, said that transients, who account for 30-35 percent of the hotel's operating income, are housed on the 3rd floor. Regular tenants, who comprise 60-75 percent of the hotel's occupancy, are housed on floors 4-6.


While the housing units have been made more comfortable and safe, Arai said, the hotel lobby will be left fairly intact to preserve the historical look of the Bush Hotel. The paneled walls, intricately-carved wood trim, the tiled floor, and large beams supporting the hotel's double-doored entry -- all will be restored to resemble their original appearance. New windows have been installed and the entry has been recessed. New furniture will replace the ripped and battered, run-down dusty couches and chairs.


The 2nd floor, however, was ""completely reconstructed,"" said Arai, because it would be used for office space, not housing. It would require different mechanical, electrical, and spacial treatment.


The park level of the hotel will open directly onto Hing Hay Park. It will house the community center and commercial lease space. Completely reconstructed, the park level will have a community space which would contain a large meeting room and some smaller rooms. A ""commercial catering kitchen"" was built on this level, said Arai, and people can ""bring pre-cooked food and warm it up."" But it is not a fullcooking kitchen. Inter*Im Director Bob Santos said that when more funds are available, it ""should eventually become a cooking kitchen.""


The hotel's street level will contain small commercial businesses. Access is through an indoor shopping arcade with entrances on the east and west sides of the building.


The architectural intent was to separate the hotel and commercial-community space, said Arai, so that residents would retain their privacy. The 2nd floor, park level, and street level will share an entrance on the west side. An elevator will be located here to serve only these floors.


Other design features that have been done or are proposed include the following: installing burglar alarms on the 2nd floor and commercial shop areas, installing a fire-sprinkler throughout the 1st, 2nd, and lower floors, installing a new elevator, painting the exterior building, and ornamenting the exterior building with wood trim.


The contractor estimates that the Bush Community Center will be completed in mid-June.


However, until the Annex is constructed, the project will not be complete.


The Annex is part of the Bush Community Center Project and will be a place where large meetings and programs can be held with a capacity of 600 people. It faces many of the same delaying problems encountered by the community center. McDonald Sullivan. Public Authority Executive, cited the problems and the dates those problems were resolved with the community center construction: acquiring the property (June 1978), determining how the building was to be handled architecturally (November 1979), agreeing on the terms for the contract bid (August 1980), and obtaining bank loans (January 1980). He said all these problems had one thing in common: they involved lengthy negotiations.


Sullivan said the Public Authority is presently waiting for the Annex's building permit and drawings to be completed. Once these are cleared, construction can start and the Annex should be completed in five months.


The site for the Annex is the T & C Garage, a two-level building at 407-413 Seventh Avenue South. The assignment was to renovate the construction for community use. Rod Clarke and Dennis Su, A.I.A., are the Annex architects.


The upper floor is designed to have 6,000 square feet of space which can be used to hold art exhibitions, cultural events, receptions, and large meetings. A new mid-level, near sidewalk level, will house the Cicada Co-Op and the International Examiner office. The lower level will have a 150-seat theatre/auditorium. It will also include rehearsal and office spaces for the Theatre Seattle Foundation. The foundation is a group of three independent theatre groups working together who plan to share the use of the theatre: Womyn's Theatre, Red Earth Performing Company, and the Asian Exclusion Act.


Financing has come from hotel revenue, and government and bank loans. Ms. Laranang said that financing to date is $3,409,000 and the projected cost when completed is $3,414,000. She said the $5,000 deficit is not a serious problem. They can ""absorb"" the difference by ""reducing the Public Authority administrative budget.""


The project will be paid of in about 15 years, said Ms. Laranang. Explaining how the project will be paid off, she gave a breakdown on the projected yearly finances for the completed Bush Community Center Project. Estimated gross income for the project is $476,000. Deducting $220,000 mortgage-miscellaneous payments and $171,000 estimated hotel operating expenses, the estimated yearly net income is $85,000. This money will go to the Public Authority, she said, and will be used ""to pay administrative costs"" and fund new developments in the International District. She stressed that these figures are ""very rounded estimates.""

International District social service agencies, reeling from Reagan's announcement of massive cutbacks in the flow of federal funds, are scrambling to locate over $200,000 to cover anticipated shortfalls for the last three months of 1981.


Reagan has proposed elimination of all Comprehensive Employment and Training (CETA) public service jobs by the end of September. This action cancels a principal source of funding for the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC), Denise Louie Child Care Center, International Drop-In Center (IDIC) and International Examiner.


The Reagan administration has also announced that it will not seek reauthorization of the Economic Opportunity Act, a move which could effectively kill the Community Services Administration (CSA), the source of operational funds for anti-poverty agencies like the International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im). CSA also supports CISC's Newcomer Program.


Because of Reagan's announced cutbacks, ID social service agencies need to raise the following amounts during the last three months of 1981: Inter*Im, $23,750; International District Community Health Clinic, $70,000 to $100,000; Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), $60,000; Denise Louie Childcare Center, $20,000; CISC, $20,000; IDIC, $10,000; International Examiner $7,500.


Al Kurimura, International District manager, remarked, ""I don't know what good the housing that we got for the District is if we don't have the services to go along with it. That's the bottom line.""


Bob Santos, Inter*Im director, said glumly, ""I just hope we don't have to close our doors."" Inter*Im, which receives all its operational funds from CSA, coordinates the widely touted community garden, a meal voucher program for the elderly and the community food-buying co-op.


Don Wright, local CSA official, said, ""I don't see how agencies like Inter*Im can survive without a federal mandate, a national law to say that it is the policy of the United States government to address the paradox of poverty in the midst of wealth and plenty.""


The Economic Opportunity -- Act expires at the end of September and, according to critics of the Reagan administration, Reagan endeavors to kill the federal commitment to the war on poverty by not seeking reauthorization of the Act.


The Examiner has learned, however, that Democratic Congressman Ike Andrews of North Carolina will introduce, within the next two weeks, legislation to reauthorize the Economic Opportunity Act for another three years. ""We're going to rewrite the Act so that it's a good, sound bill from a technical standpoint,"" a House aide told The Examiner. ""The minority side (Republicans) would like to have a one-year reauthorization."" When testimony on the reauthorization begins in early April, the House source said, ""CSA will probably be the most controversial issue.""


If Congress decides to renew the Act, committees of the House and Senate would have to recommend appropriation of funds to CSA.


According to a source on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, ""no one on our committee has taken a public position on CSA yet. We just got the proposal (from Reagan). I really can't tell you whether the proposal will pass or not. Some members of the committee will support it and I'm sure some will oppose it.""


The House subommittee was scheduled to hold public hearings on CSA funding March 16 and 17. Santos said Inter*Im ""will be lobbying like crazy"" to get Congress to continue CSA.


Meanwhile, Kurimura, in a memorandum to the Mayor's Office, asked how the City could help ease the impact of the impending cutbacks in federal funding to the ID.


Kurimura noted that City block grant money provides less than 25 per cent of the combined budgets of the International District social service agencies facing the cutbacks. It is not expected that ID agencies will receive much additional help from the City, given the ceiling of 20 per cent of total block grant funds going to public services. Says Bill Stafford, director of inter-governmental relations for the City. ""There's not some golden pot down in City Hall to make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars that are going to be lost from the federal government. The reality is that a lot of programs are going to have to go.""


According to the City's Community Block Grant policy plan, ""there may be no alternative to cutting back or eliminating Community Development block grant support for some existing programs. For that reason, we cannot encourage submission of proposals for new service projects.


""If CETA support ends, the Community Development Block Grant program will not be able to pick up all previously funded CETA positions, but will consider those positions essential to project survival.""


International District social service agencies have turned their sights to United Way, with mixed success. ACRS and CISC are currently receiving United Way funds. The Denise Louie Child Care Center is an unsuccessful applicant. And the Health Clinic awaits word on a $50,000 request; the decision is not expected to be announced until late summer.


CISC Director Rita Wang is worried, though, that United Way funding won't be able to adequately make up for loss of CETA and CSA funds. Another drawback to United Way funding, says Wang, is that other private sector funding sources are closed off to United Way agencies.


Over at the Asian Counseling and Referral Service. Director Dave Okimoto summarizes his organization's financial condition tersely. ""It looks bad."" He's particularly worried about a loss of funds to provide mental health services for Indochinese. ""At some point in the future,"" he says. ""I think you won't be seeing funding to deal with preventative kinds of programs or programs to deal with the mildly ill.""


Gail Tanaka, who has been director of the Health Clinic for barely four months, now faces the mammoth task of planning the financial future of a clinic which is expected to receive significant cuts in federal funds and will probably lose the key back-up support of the Public Health Service Hospital, which the Reagan administration has slated for closure. She also noted that the Clinic will lose, at the end of September, a CETA position filled by a critical family health worker who covered two Laotian languages.


Rita Wang said CISC will lose four CETA positions, which may even terminate before the end of September. ""Our CETA staff are worried to death,"" Wang said. ""Every day, they're out looking for jobs.


""Knowing my staff, I know the service level will be kept as much the same as possible, but everyone will have to work extra loads. I and the office manager would have to be direct service workers again.""


The scrapping of CETA public service jobs also throws the Denise Louie Child Care Center into a predicament: where to find sufficient replacement money to support enough staff so the Center doesn't run afoul the state licensing law requiring a ratio of one teacher to every 10 students. The bilingual, bicultural childcare center, which currently ministers to 16 children, is relocating to Bailey Gatzert School later this month.


Both the International Drop-In Center and the International Examiner are losing valuable CETA positions at the end of September, uncertain where they can prospect for replacement money. The Exammer, operated as a non-profit community service, has two CETA employees who direct a volunteer staff which produces the monthly newspaper. The Examiner recently submitted an application for funding to the Campaign For Human Development.


Doug Chin, ID housing activist who now works with the City's Office of Policy Evaluation, said, ""Reagan's strategy is to cut the budget and give the localities responsibility for administering funds. But the localities don't want the responsibility unless they have more money.""


Reagan's proposal to eliminate CSA is coupled with a proposal to transfer 75 per cent of the 1981 service level funds to the states for allocation as part of a block grant for social services. The social services block grant is one of four consolidated block grants, under the Reagan proposal.


Ruthann Kurose, legislative aide to Congressman Mike Lowry, echoed the fear of other social service proponents for the International District: ""There's nothing to say that (Governor John) Spellman, when he gets the bucks, won't do what he wants with the money and set different priorities. It's always been the federal father that has looked out for us.


""It the consolidated block grant has to go through the state legislative committee process, it's a whole new ballgame.""


According to one source in the U.S. House of Representatives, ""there will be a very complicated formula for distributing the consolidated block grants. The administration hasn't given us enough information on specifics yet, but the whole idea is state control at this point.


""The money is being given the states with no strings attached. I think there will be pressure from the House to provide specifics.


""Also, remember that with 25 per cent of the funds cut off, someone is not going to get money.""


Liz Dunbar, executive director of the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs, said the level of awareness of the International District and Asians among State legislators is ""zero."" The most effective strategy, she said, will be for ID advocates to work in larger coalition with advocates of funding for mental health, welfare and education programs.


Said Kurose, ""We may be able to salvage something. The groups with a certain amount of political savvy -- they may be able to salvage some crumbs.""

Ayumi is a three year journey . . . an adventure, a beginning sometimes a pilgrimage. And here is the meeting place, the gathering, the celebration. This Anthology is the culmination of our search and discovery of inter-generation experiences of Japanese America.""


So begins the introduction to Ayumi: A Japanese American Anthology published by the Japanese American Anthology Committee of San Francisco. This handsome soft-cover volume is a collection of graphic art and literature spanning four generations of Japanese Americans. Included are short stories and poems of Issei, Nisei, Sansei and Yonsei writers, plus a short collection of color and black-and-white prints of works by Japanese American artists.


Ayumi is dedicated to the late Toshio Mori, the prolific writer whose. Yokohama, California established him as a major writer. Mori's life and art have influenced and inspired a young generation of Asian American artists and writers to ""realize our full humanity."" Mori wrote hundreds of short stories and six novels, but only in the last few years have many of his works been published. His short story Homecoming is included in this anthology.


Ayumi takes the reader through Japanese America from the late 1800's, when the first Issei came to the United States, through the war years and internment to the present. By undergoing such a journey, it is possible to contrast and understand three generations of Japanese Americans that are so different from each other: Issei, Nisei and Sansei.


The literature of the Issei is presented both in Japanese and English translation. These works exemplify the great diversity in experience of the Issei, often ignored by stereotypes of stoic, hard-working farmers. We hear the story of a man whose anti-war beliefs during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria led him to join a Marxist group and work to enlighten other Japanese Americans. In America After Twenty-Five Years, an Issei couple living in New York become victims of McCarthyism because of their friendship with Communists.


To many Issei, the United States became their home unintentionally; Japan remained in their minds for many years. Mitsuo Mitagawa's The Grey Cemetery is an amusing story of an old man who, after a trip back to Japan, desires to be buried there. The sudden realization of ""where is home"" is succinctly given in Yoshihiko Tomari's poem:


To my surprise


I have already lived in America for fifty years.


still in my mind a foreign country


Nisei literature concerns itself with internment, war, racism, and sexism. Most notable are two short stories by Hiroshi Kashiwagi, about women and traditional sexism, and one by Hisaye Yamamoto. These illustrate a fundamental difference between Nisei and Issei. The free-thinking attitudes of the second generation, raised in America, conflicted with their traditional, duty-bound upbringing. Kashiwagi presents two women who resolve these conflicts in very distinctive ways.


The rage and tragedy of the internment years is the subject of many works. Mori's Homecoming relates a mother and daughter's experience with a racist California town while visiting the son, injured in the war. The strength of the mother is indicative of many Issei portrayed in these pages.


Women, especially mothers are also the main characters in many of the Sansei works. Perhaps these women are viewed as embodiments of strengths and weaknesses of the people, since they are the sources and primary teachers. Robert H. Komo's Akiko's Acre of Love is an admirable portrayal of another strong issei woman, who has survived her husband and friends. It illustrates a typical Japanese. American family's experience through the war years.


Probably more realistic are the women in stories by Keiko Kubo and Janice Mirikitani, member of the editorial board of the Anthology Committee. These characters, though not totally liberated in the modern sense, nevertheless act agressively to resist mistreatment by men. The Woman and the Hawk, in a mythical combination of prose and poetry, depicts such a woman who does not escape her seemingly predestined role.


The graphics section is somewhat short but diverse. The prints depict camp experiences, landscapes, and portraits. Sadayuki Uno, Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Wendy Yoshimura are some of the more well-known artists. Mine Okubo's Mother and Cat is particularly memorable.


This anthology, like AIEEE, shows there is a tradition of Japanese American literature and art, colored by our experience here in America. This experience is uniquely Japanese American, a new experience self-affirmed through art and literature. Garrett K. Hongo's poem Roots gives the finest evocation of this experience:


When I pace the seven steps of the shrine in my soul.


the old man of my dreams will be me.


leaning into the wind blowing off the Mojave.


over Sierra passes and stands of sequoia


circling around L.A. to spin out past Catalina.


across the Pacific all the way to Asia and heritage will be an ancient flute


throbbing from its place in my heart


where his heart has found its roots.

Seven teaching positions, which had earlier been cut from the Seattle School District's bilingual program, have been restored following appropriation of additional funds for refugee education.


Meanwhile, several organizations and individuals concerned about bilingual education have joined in a lawsuit to demand that the State of Washington recognize bilingual education as a basic educational need for students in the state's public schools.


The Seattle School District had reduced its 1981-82 bilingual services by eliminating 11 bilingual teaching positions, which would affect about 900 students and eliminating the tutorial programs which serve about 500 bilingual students and several bilingual instructional aides, according to Lily Woo, a resource teacher in the bilingual program office.


Woo is also president of the Chinese Educators Association, a group that coordinated a letter writing campaign in May to pressure the School District to provide bilingual services for students with limited English ability.


Congress, however, recently appropriated about $251,000 for Indochinese refugee education through Title VI, enabling the Seattle School District to restore at least seven bilingual teacher positions for the upcoming school year, according to School District's Budget Analyst Pat Moyer. Other cuts may also be restored before the school year begins, Moyer said.


Beginning in September, 1981, Moyer said, $3.6 million would be appropriated to the Seattle School District's bilingual program from federal, state and school district sources, to serve over 3,000 students, 60 percent of whom are Indochinese. ""At the current funding level,"" Moyer said, ""we would anticipate having a program comparable to what we had last year.""


Woo, however, believes it's ""pressure"" from concerned people that forced the School District to restore those positions. Back in May, Woo said, the Chinese Educators Association contacted several community organizations, asking them to write letters to the School District in support of the bilingual program.


It also urged bilingual parents to file suit with the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights against the School District for its failure to provide the mandatory bilingual services. ""What the School District was doing was unconstitutional ""Woo said. ""As long as any school district receives federal money, it has to provide bilingual services to students in need.""


""The School District received at least a couple of hundred letters from the Chinese community,"" Woo said. It had not received such feedback before from the Chinese community, she added.


The Association also took issue with the School District's refusal to accept new bilingual students who wanted to attend while the schools were in session. As of May 21, Woo said, 106 students with limited English ability were denied entrance. This would not have happened, she said, to students who are placed in other programs, such as in the handicapped or gifted programs.


The Association is waiting for the School District's next move to restore other bilingual services. ""The excuse it's giving,"" Woo said, ""is it is waiting for more money to come in and that if it has the money, it will restore as much (bilingual services) as it can before the school year begins."" If the School District doesn't restore more bilingual services, she said, the Association would make a ""big stink"" again.


Meanwhile, several organizations and individuals in an attempt to get state money for the bilingual program, have decided to join the Seattle School District in its lawsuit against the State of Washington over how basic education is being funded.


In terms of bilingual education, says the Seattle School District General Counsel Michael Hoge, ""the lawsuit seeks to have declared (in federal court) that it is the state's responsibility to include bilingual education within the state's definition of basic education and, as such, much be fully funded by the state.""


Currently, bilingual education is funded through the State's block grant program a program in which the state provides the School District a block of money to be shared at the District's discretion among bilingual, special education and other special programs.


For the 1981-1982 school year, the Seattle School District received $5 million, $169,000 of which was earmarked for the bilingual program, says Ramon Soliz, Chairperson of the Bilingual Commission, a group which advises the Seattle School District on bilingual education and which has decided to join the lawsuit. Soliz claimed that the amount was insufficient. ""We had estimated between $350,000 to $400,000 to maintain the same kind of program we had last year,"" he said.


Hoge said the School District ""had no other choice"" but to sue the state. He explained that, in 1975, the Seattle School District had sued the State of Washington to have declared in court that it is the state's obligation to fully fund basic education. The Seattle School District won the case, but the Washington State Supreme Court gave the State of Washington until mid-1981 to come up with an adequate definition of basic education and to fully fund it.


""We feel,"" Hoge said, ""that the legislature has not yet adequately defined basic education. The state has come up with a good definition of the regular education program, but it has not taken into account the special needs of those students in such programs as bilingual and special education. Our contention is that an adequate definition must include those programs."" The lawsuit is in the preliminary stages. ""We hope the judge would make some preliminary ruling during the month of August,"" Hoge said.

American Cinema Productions . . . produced and distributed the motion picture, ""Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen."" We find this film to be insulting to Asian people and strongly urge theatre managers to refrain from showing the film. We further urge moviegoers not to patronize theatres that do plan to show the film.


Earlier last year, American Cinema Productions sought to film segments of ""Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen"" in San Francisco. However, due to C.A.N. Charlie Chan's opposition, the filmmakers were successfully prevented from filming in San Francisco's Chinatown.


There exist sound reasons for such public protest. The Charlie Chan character resurrects fundmentally racist stereotypes of Asian people. Charlie Chan is an infamous character, an ugly myth without human depth, who can only speak in Confucian parables and pidgin English. While some may find this characterization humorous, we find that it is humor which debases and maligns Asian culture and dignity.


The impact of films such as ""Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen"" on Asian self-image can be severe. Historically, media treatment of Asian people, through such characters as Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, and Suzie Wong, has been demeaning and derogatory. There has been a virtual absence of any positive, nonstereotypical media images for Asians in television and film. This imbalance is further reason for public protest over this particular film.


We therefore urge theatre managers to refrain from showing ""Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen"" and further urge the moviegoing public not to patronize theatres that do show the film. The film's pandering to prejudice simply cannot be condoned or tolerated.

""Art is a language which communicates on a number of different levels,"" says Norie Sato, media director of the and/or gallery.


Sato's philosophy of art is that it should be a form of communication, just like reading or watching television is a type of communication, and that people should educate themselves on it.


She wants to do this through video, which she has done a lot of work in.


""It's as much a communication tool,"" Sato said, ""although a somewhat different language that people need to learn.""


""I hope I can show other people the communicative form of art,"" Sato said. ""Visual, audio, other art that touches othe senses besides sight.""


Sato, who was born in Japan and came to the U.S. when she was five, has been media director of the and/or gallery 1976. The and/or is a non-profit corporation that sponsors public programs, provides support services for artists and is currently featuring visual and media exhibitions, performances, video tape shows and talks.


Sato hopes, at the and/or gallery, ""to display newer art forms, experimental stuff, not commercial work that people can buy. I don't want to compete with other galleries.""


Sato says she wants to experiment with art forms that will ""take people in,"" get them involved instead of just ""looking at"" the art work.


And/or is a place that shows quality work that's difficult to see anywhere else,"" Sato said. ""We take risks, experiment and show things that really vary from [just] visual.""


For example, the and/or is currently sponsoring an exhibit by Gary Hill of Santa Monica, California. The sculpture, titled ""Glass Onion,"" incorporates five television monitors, eight channels of audio sounds and a camera aimed towards the exhibit from the ceiling.


The sculpture involves sound, videotape and installations which combine video imagery and sound.


""It's a perception process of information that flows around you,"" Sato said. ""What you take in depends upon what you pick up and how close you listen and see.


""The camera makes clear the rectangular structure and the view from above changes our [normal] perception, seeing yourself in the image as well,"" Sato said. ""You then become a creative participant as well.""


So in becoming a more ""active"" part of the artist's work, Sato hopes that this will create a clearer understanding of what the artist is communicating to the viewer.


Sato received her bachelor's degree in printmaking from the University of Michigan and her master's degree from the University of Washington.


An artist's life is not an easy one, although Sato manages to keep herself busy. She's been a consultant for the National Endowment for the Arts, last year lectured at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and just this past year made art-related trips to New York, Washington D.C., Colorado, Texas and Utah. She is also a regional representative for the National Organization for Media Art Centers. She's also planning a show at the Linda Farris Gallery in May and is currently one of many artists in an exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.


""It's a haphazard existence,"" Sato said. ""But I think I'm always changing. I'd like to get to the point where I feel that people were interested in what I did. Beyond that I'd certainly like to spend more time on my own work.


""My interest is at the point where I'm interested in other parts of the city, of society,"" Sato said. ""Like working with architecture, public art works, other aspects of society. I feel I've outlived my effectiveness as a program curator.""

A peek into the unassuming fish market on the corner of 7th Ave. and King St. will intrigue you. A large, waterfilled tank teaming with crabs and an open fish counter filled with the day's catch will lure you into the store.


The Barclay Seafoods and Meat Corporation, located at 703 S. King, is open weekdays and Saturday, from 10:30 am-6:30 pm and Sunday from 12 pm to 4 pm.


A customer can personally see, touch and select his dinner. Owners C. T. & T. K. Kuo, upon their arrival in Seattle four years ago, saw a need for this type of market catering especially to the needs of the Chinese.


""We had to make a living,"" said C. T. Kuo, ""yet we wanted to provide a service to the community in the process. We wanted to provide an old-fashioned family-type atmosphere, a viable alternative to the pre-packaged supermarket approach.""


As most of their fish and seafood products are bought from local fishermen (and as far away as Alaska and the east coast), Kuo never really knows what the day will bring.


Fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables are also sold at the market, as well as such staples as rice and garlic. ""The customer is always satisfied here as they know what they are (getting),"" Kuo said with a smile, as he slips behind the counter to gut and specially prepare a fish for a customer. When asked about the future, Kuo sees himself doing exactly the same thing at exactly the same place.

On February 19, Friends of Visual Communications Seattle/King Street Media Works, will host Seattle's benefit premiere of Hita Hata: Raise the Banner at the Toyo Cinema at 7:30 p.m. Hito Hata is the first feature-length film written, directed and produced by Asian American. Proceeds will go towards production expenses for Visual Communications, whose staff worked two years and many long hours without pay to produce this film about the lives of Japanese immigrants in America. Additional showings will be on Sunday, February 22, at 2:00 p.m., and Monday, February 23, at 7:30 p.m.


The premiere of the Seattle showing falls on the anniversary of the February 19, 1942, signing of Executive Order 9066, which ordered the evacuation of all Japanese aliens and citizens of Japanese descent from the west coast, and coincides with the redress effort which is attempting to win compensation for losses suffered by Japanese Americans interned during the war.


The film tells the story of 90-year-old Oda portrayed by Japanese actor-director Mako, who is living out his days in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles' Japantown. Oda faces losing his home as the community is undergoing modernization and redevelopment. For Oda, such a change along with his advancing years and ill health brings him to look back on his life.


He befriends Linda, an assimilated Sansei who has lost touch with her community and turned her back on her cultural roots. Through flashbacks, Oda tells her of his experiences as a railway worker and farm hand in the early 1900s, in Little Tokyo in its heyday in the '30s, interned with other West Coast Japanese during WWII, to today. As Linda learns more about Oda's life, she comes to value her background and joins him in the fight against eviction.


The film is based on information gathered from interviews, academic sources and the personal experiences of Issei men. Their collective experiences are told through Oda, a man who has deep feeling for his fellow workers and friends.


Hito Hata, meaning ""to raise a single banner, ""was a common expression Issei immigrants used when they came to the U.S. In old Japan, only the samurai and the wealthy were given the honor of raising flags and banners. Many Issei came to America hoping to make enough money so they could return home rich enough to raise their own banner. For most, this dream was never realized and America became their home.


The film attempts to fill a gap in American history by portraying the rarely acknowledged contributions made by first-generation Japanese (Issei) to the building and growth of America. The story is based on the true experiences of Issei bachelors, many of whom are living in Japantowns today. They are often overlooked by the Japanese community and their contributions on the railroads, in the farm fields and in building this country are often unacknowledged. Few people know the hardship they have endured.


When the Issei first arrived, few had thoughts of remaining permanently in the U.S. The majority saw America as the ""land of economic opportunity"" which would provide them the means of buying land when they returned home, a measure of status and freedom from predatory money lenders. Thus, Japanese labor emigration for the most part was spurred by the desire for personal economic betterment rather than by the necessity of escaping political or economic turmoil at home.


The bulk of Issei immigrants were recruited to replenish the supply of labor on farms, on railroads, in the mines and in the canneries, when that supply began to dwindle with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The 1882 Act restricted the further immigration of Chinese laborers when they were perceived as a threat to the job security of white laborers.


In the early years many Issei men were single. Their bachelorhood was involuntary, caused by poverty and anti-Asian legislation such as restrictive immigration and anti-miscegenation laws which prevented marriage to Caucasian women. They contended with poor living conditions, transient and low-paying jobs, racism and discrimination. Although a few managed to become economically successful, most were stripped of their life savings and their businesses and homes when the Japanese were evacuated from the West Coast after Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941.


Additional scenes in Hito Hata depict Oda's life as a migrant farm worker. The U.S. Immigration Commission estimated that in the summer of 1909, there were some 39,000 Japanese working in farming, which would account for more than half of all Japanese in the U.S. at that time. Possibly no more than 6,000 were independent farmers, with most of the rest working as hired hands. When the summer season was over, many of these agricultural workers followed jobs into other industries such as the lumber mills, or salmon canneries, or migrated into the cities to seek employment.


In Hito Hata's farm sequence, Oda is working as part of a Japanese agricultural crew which is chased out of town by an all-white vigilante group. In 1921, in Turlock, California, a similar incident took place. Japanese cantaloupe pickers were run out by a group of men from the farmers' and grange associations with shotguns and clubs. The vigilantes were backed by the American Legion and local chambers of commerce. Since the 1890s, Japanese laborers had been victims of many acts of violence stemming from economic greed and racism.


As with the Chinese before them, many campaigns against Japanese immigration were based on the number of jobs ""cheap Asian labor"" was taking away from white men. The hostility against Japanese laborers was bad enough, but it became considerably more intense when immigrants stepped out of the role of the exploited and became competitors of white men as farm operators and businessmen. That was a dangerous position for an immigrant group to assume in the West of that time. Like the blacks of the South and the Chinese a generation before them, the Japanese were accepted only so long as they remained in their place.


The Japanese immigrant arriving in the U.S. in the earliest years of the 1900s had an alternative if he did not want to go into agricultural labor: the railroads. The railroad tracks that the Chinese had helped to lay across the West needed maintenance, and as the number of Chinese laborers began to diminish, the Japanese stepped in.


In 1906, just before the Gentlemen's Agreement halted the influx of unskilled labor, there were an estimated 13,000 Issei, perhaps as many as one in every three Issei in the U.S., working on the railroads. Responding to the need for labor and the urging of bosses, the newcomers headed eastward almost directly off the ships. Few had any opportunity to see or learn anything of America before they were off to join section gangs made up entirely of Japanese.


In the north, immigrants followed the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroad over the Cascade Mountains, into Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas. Their pay was 95 cents to a dollar a day. Freezing weather swept down on them in the winter and sometimes these men suffered from frostbite to keep the tracks open. Farther south, the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific tracks were worked by immigrants in dry, hot weather.


One Issei, whose experiences were used in constructing the Hito Hata storyline, now lives in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo and worked on the railroads. He came to the U.S. at age 16, started as a waterboy for the crews and worked his way up. Problems that plagued him and the section gang included poor food, meager pay and harsh conditions such as working and sleeping in the snow.

After 28 years on Capitol Hill, Luke's Pharmacy will open on May 26 at a new site located on the street level of the International House on the corner of Maynard Ave. S. Jimmy Luke and Hoover Mar, longtime partners of Luke's Pharmacy, along with Bertha and Herb Tsuchiya of Genessee Street Pharmacy have formed a corporation to operate the new Luke's Pharmacy.


Luke has felt that there was a need for a pharmacy in the International District (ID) and ""always wanted to settle down there"" but he explained, ""Most of the sites are too small for a pharmaly and it's hard to find two storefronts together.


Mar noted the resurgence of the ID during the last few years and commented, that ""the area was such that it warranted a move.""


Being born and raised in the ID, Luke regards the ID as his home. ""I was born in a house on the lot that's now Chong Wa's Playground ... my playground was Chinatown,"" he said.


Luke went to the University of Washington and graduated from the School of Pharmacy in 1942, a time when tuition was $99 per academic year and the total enrollment was 12,000 students.


Many of their clients use both herbs and western medicine. To this Luke commented. ""I don't discourage it. Herbs have their therapeutic use. I figure it must be good to last through all these centuries.""


Luke's Pharmacy will continue to stock only western medication and household items at the new location.


Luke estimates that 75 percent to 80 percent of his clients are elderly who may be taking several different types of medication. This often leads to confusion.


""People sometimes call and ask me about their medication. A lot of them take a half dozen different pills and so it's very easy to get confused ... They call up and ask, 'what's this white pill for?' and it's hard to tell just over the phone,"" explained Luke.


""Now they can come down ... I think we'll probably have a lot more walk-in traffic ... We can do a better job down there,"" commented Luke. ""In our field, it's our job to help people, especially older people.""


Free prescription delivery service, which is Mar's responsibility, will still be continued. The delivery demands are likely to switch -- instead of delivering to the Beacon Hill area as in the past. Mar will probably deliver more to the Broadway area.


Grand opening date is scheduled for June 5 or 6.


Luke regards the move to the ID as a return to his roots. Part of you is down there ... you move away but you wander back ... that's where your memories are,"" he said. ""Going back is just like going home to me.""

The resume is designed to let potential employers know about your skills and how you can help them in their business. An effectively composed resume will help you land an interview with a prospective employer and make people remember you after you have presented yourself in the interview. The format should be concise, as explained in the following suggestions:


Introduction: Here provide your name, address and phone number (both your home and work number).


Experience: List your work experience by function, that is, describe the kinds of things you have done over the years, giving a clear indication of your capabilities. List employers at the end of each function categories or at the end. Also indicate your present job, if applicable. You do not have to list the dates of employment. If you are a graduate student, list your job experiences, any leadership skills you gained through extracurricular activities and organizations.


Personal Background: List your education. Other personal items such as age and marital status can be included voluntarily; anti-discrimination laws discourage employers from seeking such information. Off-work activities and interests help round out your background as depicted in the resume.


References: Indicate that you will provide this information upon request.


Your resume is not complete without a cover letter. When composing the letter, keep several things in mind: Why are you writing? State that you are interested in the company and that you are looking for work with the company. What will you bring to the firm? Highlight your experience and skills that are most relevant to the company. Focus on specific achievements demonstrating your capability and success in your work. Why are you looking for a job? Briefly describe your reasons for instance, ""I feel I can gain more experience or potential at your company,"" or ""There is limited potential for advancement at my present job."" Finally, indicate to the employer that you would like to schedule an appointment in the next several days.


Your resume should be kept to one page, neatly typed with wide margins and proper spacing. Put your name, address and phone number at top, professional experience in the middle and personal information at the end. You can include your job objective either in the resume or cover letter. Refine the original, make a clean typed copy and have copies printed.


Resumes are also designed to weight the ""strengths and weaknesses"" of job experiences and achievements of several candidates for a particular job vacancy. But just as important as content is the neatness, style, appearance, and correctness of the resume. For further information, check with your local library job and career section for books on job hunting. Refer to these books for sample resumes to get further ideas.

""I was sitting in my office talking to the nursing supervisor when this guy barges in, accuses me of spitting in his medicine and lunges at me with hands reaching for my throat,"" Bruce Miyahara, administrator of Health Care Services for the King County Jail, vividly recalled.


Miyahara had been the director of the International District Community Health Center until he stepped down in 1977 and went back to school for a Master's Degree.


Miyahara, in 14 months as health care administrator, is responsible for coordinating the delivery of all medical services, including dental, nursing, and psychiatric services, to his clients, the residents of the King County Jail.


""When I first started,"" he said, ""I expected to find a chaotic, neglected organization."" He did. ""My initial reaction,"" he continued, ""was that the jail was a place where the name of the game is survival for both the inmates and workers. A place with no direction.""


He is responsible for the health care of a clientele of 800 to 1100 prisoners. ""Overcrowding,"" he observed ""is the reality. We have enough beds to handle 500 so I guess you can call that maximum capacity. Then again, you can go by standards set by the State Jail Commission which measures capacity by so many cubic feet per inmates. Given that standard for maximum capacity, the ideal capacity for the King County Jail would be between 300 to 400 inmates.


""Overcrowding affects our ability to provide health services. The jail population really can't function when it goes over 900. There's not enough officers to watch out for problems, not enough social workers to provide placement and counseling, and not enough medical staff to deliver services. A lot of time is devoted to feeding the population when the numbers are that high. Meal times are a time when high security is invoked. Nothing can happen when high security is involved -- lawyers can't see their clients and we can't provide any services.""


Miyahara said the health services provided include ""anything and everything -- injuries caused by tights, cancer, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, you name it. Most of the jail population have neglected their health care for whatever reason -- some couldn't afford it, some weren't aware of it, others avoided it because they didn't want to bring up their criminal past.""


The jail, Miyahara said, is viewed as a place of hard core criminals by the public but he complained, it is ""based on misinformation. The hard core are a minority. Most of the prison population are the hard luck stories who end up here because of their inability to handle society.


""We see rapists, murderers, drunk drivers, and jaywalkers. The jail tries to segregate the population -- put the hard core with the hard core, the gays with the gays, and first time offenders with each other.""


There are inmates who should not be in the King County Jail, Miyahara said. ""It's not an appropriate facility for many of them. We had to treat one guy who had terminal brain cancer. His crime was having two undersized trout. Although he did commit a crime, the jail's not the appropriate facility for him.


""But the worst use of the jail,"" Miyahara said, ""is putting the mentally ill there. Most people don't realize it but the King County Jail is the second or third largest mental institution in the state. Some are segregated but many are mixed in with the general population, creating a threat not only to the general population, but to themselves.""


There have been 20 suicide attempts in the last 20 months. ""I can't tell you how many have been successful because I'm starting to block the successful ones out,"" he said. The rash of suicides rises in the spring. The number of suicides is proportional to the size of the jail population and related to the inability to cope with over-crowding, according to Miyahara.


The jail is seeing an increasing number of Asian prisoners. ""And some of them have mental problems,"" Miyahara said. ""Part of it,"" he said, ""is due to cultural adjustment. The Indochinese and other Asian immigrants have a language barrier. For those who come to the jail, it's often a question of what the person did as opposed to what someone else observed. Someone could get picked up for not paying for a meal at a restaurant or for staring at people in a department store. Cultural influences affect the psychosis. It's not appropriate. The jail can't deal with the American born 'psychotic' let alone the foreign born 'psychotic.'""


Jail reform is a political issue which focuses from time to time when some unfortunate incident occurs. ""In the sixties,"" Bruce noted, ""nobody got excited about the jails until middle class political activists started getting arrested and seeing how bad the jails really were."" The recent focus on the county jail by the politicians and the media is attributable, Miyahara said, to two incidents.


""Well, the death of Shelly Johnson (the inmate who collapsed and died in his cell after being subdued by corrections officers during a violent fit), caused a lot of public interest in what was going on. He had a lot of problems and the jail probably was not the appropriate facility for him.""


The other incident, Miyahara said was ""that the health care staff just got fed up with the neglect and the inability to provide services. It used to be that when we needed a nurse like immediately, we had to go through a lot of red tape. The bureaucracy just couldn't respond to a 'real' situation. Going through the Personnel Department and the hiring process -- exams, applications, ratings -- would take three months to get that nurse. The hiring process is fine and would work where you don't need a fast response. But the bureaucrats don't set foot inside the jail. There is a difference between the suits and ties on the outside and the uniforms on the inside."" But, Miyahara said, the Personnel Department, particularly with the airing of concerns by the health staff, has recognized the jail as a high priority area and has made it easier for Bruce to hire staff in a more timely manner.


Miyahara would like to see some changes made in providing more adequate health care. He said, ""prisoners are protected by the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. Being denied health care is 'cruel and unusual' punishment. There has to be a balance between what services are available in the community and what we are providing. When a prisoner becomes incarcerated, the loss of access to health services must be compensated for. I'm going through a guilt trip right now -- inmates' rights and the cutbacks in all community programs. The jail shouldn't take care of the mentally ill. It may cost, but society has to pay the price.

Ron Mamiya, attorney, has been appointed by Mayor Charles Royer to a Municipal Court position effective January 1, 1981. Although he will be leaving the International District, he maintains that his ""heart and soul remain."" He will miss his private practice because he has ""made a lot of friends and helped people out."" Mamiya still feels he will be able to help people while on the Municipal bench, but the contact will be less personal.


One reason Mamiya looks forward to his judgeship is because he feels the ""Asian American perspective in the court is lacking."" ""The Asian American viewpoint,"" said Mamiya, ""is molded partially from having ancestors who have come from another country, having different physical characteristics from the white society's stereotypes of Asian Americans."" Mamiya would like to complement the judges on the bench and sensitize others in the judiciary to the Asian American perspective.


The International District has long been Mamiya's home base and the pivotal point for his involvement in such community efforts as the redress movement (compensation to Japanese Americans who were interned during WWII), the Japanese American Citizen's League, the International District Economic Association and his participation in countless seminars and workshops.


In the course of his activities, Mamiya has been pleased to see an influx of third generation Asian Americans into the District. Years ago, the trend was in the opposite direction, Mamiya's grandfather owned and ran a confectionary shop. Sagamiya's. The work was long and hard. The grandparents encouraged their children to complete their education and pursue other professions which would eventually take them, as well as other second generation sons and daughters out of the community.


Mamiya, was drawn back into the International District with the establishment of his law partnership with Rod Kawakami. During the five years of his practice, the law firm became part of the network of District service organizations seling and Referral Service.


Addressing the problems experienced by the Asian refugees, Mamiya says the illegal behavior among the recent immigrants is often a manifestation of culture shock. The survival skills learned in their native country, where the social and economic structure has broken down, are inappropriate in this country. ""Their values are in many respects totally different and are, many times, at odds with our legal traditions.""


Ironically, ""there is a stereotyped view of Asian Americans from the criminal justice standpoint which sees Asian Americans as rarely having legal involvement in the criminal justice system."" We have alcohol problems, drug problems, psychological, social and economic problems like every other group in the U.S. With his appointment to the bench, Mamiya hopes to counter this misconception and begin to deal realistically with the problems faced by Asian Americans and the new immigrant population when they become involved in the legal system.

The newly-appointed superintendent for the Seattle Public Schools earlier this month told a group of community activists he will consider appointing an Asian to the post of assistant superintendent.


Donald J. Steele, Jr. who began his term as superintendent on July 1, faced questions from a crowd of about 50 persons at the International House on September 2. The community meeting was sponsored by Asian Americans for Political Action, the Washington Association for Asian and Pacific Education, Japanese American Citizens League and Filipino American Educators.


Steele previously served as school superintendent in Saginaw, Michigan from 1976 to 1978, and superintendent in Toledo Chio from 1973 to 1981.


Asked whether he would consider appointing an Asian assistant superintendent he responded that the District ""should have . . . an American assistant . . . He said consideration of Asian candidates would occur ""as those openings come up.""


He admitted that dealing with Asians ""will . . . for me,"" but added that the experience of dealing with different immigrant groups is similar. In Saginat. Steele worked with a student population that was 55 per cent black and 12 per cent Hispanic. He cited his experience with children of migrant workers who lacked formal education.


Steele said he agreed that the percentage of minority hiring within the District should reflect the percentage of minorities in the student population. He said, however, that he did not consider hiring a major issue now because ""we're not hiring people.""


""I would look for progress, but we're not going to make significant inroads right away,"" he said. Layoffs, he said, will determine the percentages of minorities retained.


Steele predicted that, because the average teacher age is 49, three or four years in the future there will be a great number of retirements, particularly in the administrative ranks.


On the issue of funding for bilingual education, Steele said the District would ""try to prevent any further decay from the position where we're at."" The District recently lost 18 million dollars in congressional funding, resulting in termination of four bilingual education instructors.


He suggested utilizing volunteers from outside the School District to conduct a survey to identify education priorities including bilingual education. He notes that the federal government has taken the position of considering bilingual education a ""transitional"" service.


Steele said the Secretary of Education was recently quoted as saying that the public education system was turning out ""mono-lingual bumpkins.""


""I don't disagree with him,"" Steele said. ""I'm mono-lingual. But with the way funding is going at the federal government level, I think we're going to have a lot more mono-lingual bumpkins.""


The federal government should set as the number one-priority the teaching of English skills, he said. He would like his own kids to learn a second language. Steele said, ""but if they can't pass their English class, they shouldn't take other languages.""


Steeleprovoked groans and mumblings of disagreement when he defended an earlier statement he had made in the press that racism is declining. Steele admitted that there has been ""tremendous backsliding"" in progress toward racial equality in the last six months but said. I think this is a short-term thing.""


""If you say there are not enough Japanese Americans in the School District, look at 1970, he said.


Steele also told the audience he is willing to meet regularly with them to address their concerns.

Would you be willing to participate in a televised town hall meeting with a representative of the Ku Klux Klan? That was the question KOMO-TV posed to various Seattle minority and ethnic community leaders. KOMO-TV produces the ""Town Hall Meeting,"" a public service program designed to elicit many sides on topical and controversial issues (such as abortion or outhanasia).


KOMO-TV thought about doing a program on racism in the Pacific North-west with an open debate between the KKK representative and the minority and ethnic community leaders. However, according to Kathy Tolan, the show's producer, a majority of those leaders contacted declined to participate. Most who declined to participate said they did not want to give the Ku Klux Klan any public air time or to lend any credence to its espousal of white purity and superiority. The show has been postponed.


A television show featuring a Ku Klux Klan member debating its illogical rhetoric with minority and ethnic community leaders would have had a huge viewing audience. Some people might view that as potentially dangerous because the Klan would be allowed to spread its message to recruits. A Klan appearance could enflame a racist mentality which has shown itself by cross burnings on the lawns of Seattle area blacks.


On the other hand, the Ku Klux Klan could have been exposed for what it is -- an organization feeding on hate and paranoia, their opinions based on ignorance. On a Donohue Show, a Ku Klux Klan representative was asked if the Klan favored equal rights for Hispanics. The KKK representative did not know who Hispanics were saying, ""Are they white, if they're white, they're all right.""


There is a freedom of speech involved -- not the Klan's right to speak but the public's right to know. In a town hall, debate format, the Klan representative's one-sided racist propaganda campaign would have faced close scrutiny. The Klan representative would have had to confront the truth and facts about racial equality. The public would have seen the fool and laughed.


The Ku Klux Klan, however, is not to be dismissed lightly. It is a dangerous organization, and there is definitely a racist mentality in Seattle. But one television appearance by the Klan will not change things one way or another. The racist mentality already believes the Klan position. A little education would not hurt.


In fact, the decision not to participate by minority and ethnic community leaders actually aids the Klan. Ordinarily, the Klan spreads its racist filth without contrasting opinion. As someone once said, keep repeating the same message and somebody will believe it. In the town hall setting, the Klan's message would have been counteracted.


KOMO is still planning to do a show on racism in the Pacific Northwest but the time, date, and participants are uncertain now. Kathy Tolan said the town hall setting might not be the right format. Racism can be a highly emotional issue. Just the sound of ""Ku Klux Klan"" makes people mad. But the public would have seen the fool and laughed.

The newly-renovated Bush Hotel, which witnessed a grand opening celebration last month, will soon have another reason for celebrating: completion of a greenhouse on the roof of the Hotel.


The greenhouse is now in the middle of being constructed, says interim Greenhouse Project Director Dee Walsh. Volunteers will be recruited to help after the major construction is completed.


""It will be great to have a garden for the residents to grow their own food,"" Walsh said. ""What we're also hoping is to get the most people involved as possible, at the beginning. There will be a lot of ways to involve community people.""


In Spring, 1980, a $20,000 grant request was submitted to the Neighborhood Technology Coalition for the construction of the rooftop garden; the grant was awarded in the summer of that year. During the summer, though, structural problems were detected on the root of the Hotel and the revised grant was resubmitted and awarded in the fall.


Construction began this summer later than scheduled. Implementation of a horticulture program for Bush residents should begin in winter of 1982.


""At the end of the year, the greenhouse should be ready for planting."" Chris Phol, construction manager for the Greenhouse project, said with a small laugh.


The structural problem on the roof of the Hotel was the major obstacle to construction of the Greenhouse. Dave Ernst, architect for Environmental Works and designer of the Greenhouse, found that there was a false roof built on top of the original Hotel roof. So all the materials for the Greenhouse had to be fireproof.


A four-foot airspace, which is also being fireproofed, was cut into the roof to allow for the growing space and planting tables, making the Greenhouse two stories.


""The structure has to be fireproofed and that creates problems and more work,"" said Benjie Golvin, construction assistant.


""The long delay was just kind of disappointing in that it couldn't get started sooner,"" said Deborah Bowler, the City's project manager who set up the contract to build the greenhouse with the Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority owner of the Bush Hotel.


There is a $10,000 budget for materials for the Greenhouse, most of which are ""very expensive."" said Chris. But some reasonably priced, blemished materials, purchased from CityFair, will be used for the Greenhouse project.


Steel studs, blemished glass panels, all acquired inexpensively, and sheet steel roofing are the major Greenhouse materials.


""The structural changes during the early part of construction have been slow."" Benjie said. ""You get the plans and get done what you can with unforeseen contingencies.""


Both . . . and Chris have been doing most of the work so far, for the past three months, approximately three days a week. But both are enthusiastic to be working on the Greenhouse.


""This is a real good opportunity to use appropriate technology as a tool for community development,"" said Chris who is also employed by Environmental Works.


""I like working on the project."" Benjie said. ""People in the Hotel ask about how it's going and that's nice.""


""I'm real anxious to see how it will go."" said Bowler. ""There are just a lot of possibilities, ways to use the Greenhouse. This is a special one because of the character of the neighborhood.


""People will be able to share with each other and there will be a lot of learn, too."" Bowler continued. ""There will be problems, but we'll see what works for them.""


Construction should be completed in the late fall, but volunteers will be needed to help finish the Greenhouse. Dee Walsh, interim director, will be looking for a project coordinator who will work with residents to plan a horticulture program.


The rooftop garden is real unusual said Deborah Bowler. ""It'll be a model for other gardens. And I'm just looking forward to how people will respond with all the action in the renovation of the Hotel.""

On January 29, 1981, at his first press conference, President Ronald Reagan announced that his administration was committed to the goals of affirmative action but that he was against ""quotas,"" saying, ""I remember a time when quotas were used to discriminate.""


Well I remember a time too. It's today. But when I use the word ""quota,"" I mean a quota of one -- the token Asian, the token Black, or the token minority. For some employers, the ""quota"" has been increased to include a token woman.


In talking about affirmative action goals, it is hard to conceptualize without talking about numerical goals. Affirmative action was required because minorities were under-represented or unrepresented in an employer's work force. In fact, there is a thin line, often blurred, between a ""numerical goal"" and a ""quota.""


Two recent actions will test Reagan's commitment to affirmative action.


The first concerns an agreement signed by the Carter Administration and a group of Blacks and Hispanics. Blacks and Chicanos contended that the Federal government had used an employment test biased towards whites. Government attorneys agreed and in the waning days of the Carter Administration reached a settlement with the Black and Hispanic plaintiffs. Terms of the settlement included dropping the use of the test and setting hiring goals for Blacks and Hispanics. Now, the Reagan Administration has rescinded the agreement and will not enforce its settlement terms until it has a chance to study the agreement reached.


The second is a recommendation by Reagan's transition team to consider cutting back the budget of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the Federal agency responsible for preventing employment discrimination. The transition team noted an ""antibusiness"" mentality on behalf of the Commission staff.


Reagan has only been in office for two weeks. He has not said he wouldn't enforce the terms of the settlement reached over the government's biased employment test nor has he decided to follow the recommendation to dilute the EEOC. What Reagan does with these two examples will show his commitment to affirmative action.

A threat to the Washington State bilingual education program attracted an overflow crowd, including many Asians and local school district teachers and superintendents, to a public hearing on the bill by the State House Education Committee in Olympia February 12 and 15. Representative Helen Sommers (Democrat, 36th District) recently introduced House Bill No. 243 which would change the current bilingual education program in Washington State to an English as a Second Language (ESL) progrm.


The current bilingual program, known as the Transitional Bilingual Education Program, has been in effect since 1979. Sommers testified that she would like the official state policy change ""to focus on english itself rather than bilingual programs."" The Sommers bill deletes the following language: ""The legislature finds that there are large numbers of children who come from homes where the primary language is other than english. Experience has shown that classes which are taught in english are inadequate to meet the needs of these children. The legislature finds that a bilingual education program can meet the needs of these children."" The language is replaced with ""to provide for the implementation of intensive english instruction programs."" Also, the Sommers' proposal calls for only two years of ESL instruction instead of three, as in the current bilingual program.


""With the introduction (of Sommers' bill),"" said Asian American Affairs Commission Director Elizabeth Dunbar, ""It puts a whole lot of questions on bilingual education. Even if the bill doesn't pass, it still makes it hard (to promote) bilingual education.""


A majority of those testifying were in support of retaining the bilingual education program. Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction Frank Brouillet testified, ""I think the issue is rather simple. The purpose of bilingual education is to move student into the mainstream as soon as possible from a situation (in which) they can't function to one (in which) they can. I think we (Sommers' bill and the current bilingual education law) agree on the ends (i.e. english proficiency). The major objective of the State Transitional Bilingual Program is mastery of english. The non-english language is used to help the child avoid falling behind while he/she is learning english.""


Franklin Marx, a bilingual teacher in the Prosser School District (Eastern Washington) in his testimony, stated that the bilingual program was ""created to meet a need, and it is doing the job painlessly and efficiently. Taxpayers' money has provided resource material, teachers, aides, research and testing to make this program work, and in a time when 'government waste' is a term used widely, to suddenly drop a program in which so much has been invested would truly be another example of waste.""


Dunbar, whose state agency is charged with bettering the lives of Asian Americans, in her submitted testimony, stated, ""I wish to emphasize the Asian/Pacific American communities' support for the existing program. All parents and community members share a common goal: to insure that these children learn and become competent in english. We believe that bilingual programs offer the best method for reaching that goal. The number of students eligible for the program has jumped from 3,500 in October, 1979 to 10,700 in January 1981. This dramatic increase points to the urgent need for the bilingual program. Many of these new students have had no formal schooling and their parents have had very little, if any. Teaching these children english in english will not be very effective, educationally or financially.""


Brouillet and Dunbar testified on the flexibility of the current bilingual education law which indicates that most local school districts can use alternative methods of instruction (including ESL) when less than 20 students of a particular language are present. This means, according to Brouiliet, that in Washington State, English as a Second Language is being taught in a majority of the school districts.


""The rules for the State Transitional (Bilingual Education) Program"" Brouillet said, ""allow each local school district to choose the kind of program that best fits its Jocal needs. This year, out of a total of 130 district, 85 are offering English as a Second Language only, while 31 offer both ESL and bilingual. Only one district reported 'bilingual only' under the state progam."" Co-sponsors of the bill, which is expected to go through several committees during the next few weeks, include John Eng, Dan McDonald, Shirley Galloway, and Rick Bender.

Editors note: The following article was written in response to an article in the Seattle Times in which charges were raised concerning the use of illegal ""night soil"" in the International District Community Garden.


The International District Community Garden, located on a former clay, berrycovered hillside in the International District, is a unique project providing 100 Asian elderly with land to grow vegetables.


The elderly gardeners use Raised Beds to provide drainage and aeration of the clay soil and a unique on-site composting scheme. They grow vegetable produce year around at two or three times the yield of the average gardener.


The skills of the 65 to 92-year-old gardeners have been developed over centuries in China, Japan, and the Philippines and provide an energy efficient system of producing food without chemical pesticides and fertilizers. For instance, gardeners maintain buckets of rotting eggs bok choy, shrimp wastes or other rotting kitchen and garden wastes.


If one can ignore the sometimes very undelectable odor, the use of these materials is very beneficial to plant growth providing bounteous nutrients and performing some role in insect pest control.


The recent Seattle Times article (Wednesday, August 26, 1981) which refers to various noses which have detected ""supposed illegal nightsoil"" used in the garden might explore the issue further; ""nightsoil"" is not being used, only rotten eggs shrimp, tofu and other normally wasted garden vegetable materials. These materials, which give a rather stimulating aroma to the garden, represent an ancient system of producing organic food in an urban environment. Much can be learned by gardeners in the United States from this excellent system of production.


More careful research on the part of the Times editorial staff would be valuable for readers to help determine fact from fiction and to be able to discuss issues based on facts rather than on sensationalistic remarks by news editors.

Asian women who have been abused by husbands or boyfriends can find help in the Battered Women Program run by the Asian Counseling and Referral Service.


The program, under director Theresa Fujiwara, received funding from the King County Office of Women's Programs for a five-month period ending December, 1980, to provide social services and mental health services for battered Asian women and also to train centers and shelters on cultural sensitivity.


Like battered non-Asian women, battered Asian women usually have low self-esteem and are isolated and unaware. However, Fujiwara says these characteristics are usually extreme in Asians.


Citing factors such as language barriers (most of the clients have little or no English speaking abilities), cultural influence and lack of employment skills and support from extended families, Fujiwara says, ""The majority of the women we work with are in an even more difficult situation.""


Part of the difficulty stems from the influence of culture on Asian women. Traditionally, the Asian culture emphasized values dependent on the family unit. Realizing that Asians are family-oriented, the program staff tries to involve the whole family in counseling and treatment.


""In one way,"" Fujiwara said, ""wives are assaulted by husbands and husbands are assaulted by society. They [the husbands] have to deal with additional stress sometimes due to the fact that they're Asians. Sometimes the battering is related to concrete issues that could be job-related and isn't a psychological or personal problem.""


Fujiwara explained that the stresses might be alleviated and the family stabilized if the cause of the battering could be determined. If the husband, for instance, expresses his frustration over financial difficulties through violence, the counselors will help in budgeting or locating job training programs for him.


Responses to the battering are varied. Some of the program's clients choose to get a divorce, some leave and return in a cyclic pattern, and in some instances the battering stops.


""We don't push one way or the other [for divorce or against],"" said Fujiwara. ""We want a decision that makes their lives easiest."" However, if the woman chooses to seek a divorce, the program's staff will provide legal help. Multi-lingual staff will also interpret if necessary.


Some battered women who are immigrants are usually afraid to seek help because they fear deportation, Fujiwara said.


""We've encountered Asian women who are afraid of what implications seeking help has for their permanent resident [PR] status."" She explained that the PR status is not affected and that the women won't get deported, although husbands may use this as a threat.


Although funding for the Battered Women Program ended last December, further funds are presently being pursued. The program's financial status will be determined in February. In the meantime, plans for 1981 include: starting a support group so battered Asian women can get together with other Asian women who speak the same language to share experiences, and printing informative pamphlets in various Asian languages to increase awareness of what can be done about battering.

The City Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will ""likely"" draft an ordinance appropriating $1 million of supplemental general revenue sharing funds to police and fire services, according to Jim Ritch of OMB.


Seven International District and Asian social service agencies had submitted a joint request for $90,000 of the supplemental revenue sharing funds to make up for budget shortfalls resulting from unexpected federal cuts for the remainder of 1981.


In early July, the City advertised for public comments on how the general revenue sharing funds should be spent. Only the seven social service agencies -- Inter Im, International District Housing Alliance, Chinese Information and Service Center, Asian Counseling and Referral Service. Denise Louie Child Care Association -- responded to the request for public comment.


Ritch said that OMB has not yet drafted an ordinance recommending how the funds should be spent, but that the funds will probably ""be used as one portion of the mayor's strategy to balance the budget."" It is expected that the money, which the City Council is required to appropriate by September 1, will be allocated to police and fire services.

It was a cold december morning as Ebenezer Reagan put on his coat and scart to face the bitter winter winds sweeping over the country. As he took his morning stroll, he marvelled at the crowds of people walking past him, scurrying to and from department stores in search of goodies for their loved ones. He paused to watch department store Santas bouncing little children on their knees while bright neon signs flashed on and off. ""How can these people do this?"" he wondered. ""Why, it almost seems like they are enjoying themselves.""


""These people don't know what's going on,"" he thought to himself. ""Don't they know about inflation? Don't they know that all this spending for Christmas is sure to increase the interest rate? Why, it's defeating my national economic recovery plan. They're buying socks and shirts and microwaves when they should be investing in steel mills, utilities, and nuclear power plants. They're buying toys rather than investing in the real thing. After all, why buy toy boats when you can invest in a nuclear submarine?"" Ebenezer felt it was time to take action. He picked up his pace and ran back to his white house.


Once back at the office, Ebenezer picked up his phone to call his workers together. Armed with scissors, his loyal staff responded. ""Cut the budget!"" Ebenezer yelled. ""It's tob fat!"" And his staff worked hard, long hours into the night. Ebenezer was tired. But at last, he was finished. ""This will teach the people,"" he felt. And the budget was ready, lean and hungry, except for one noticeable bulge, Ebenezer looked at the bulge. Inside the bulge were guns, missile launchers, tanks, neutron bombs, and army men. ""Why deal with imitations when I can give the people the real thing,"" Ebenezer thought. He was proud of himself. He would show the budget to some of the people who worked under him.


He walked to the house of Bob Democrachit. The Democratchits were all in the house. Ebenezer wanted to show his budget to the Democratchits because they didn't like the way he was running things. He gave them his budget and they looked it over.


A small voice spoke up. ""What is in that budget for the people?"" the voice asked. It was Tiny Tip, the spiritual leader of the Democratchits.


Ebenezer replied. ""Lower interest rates and a strong defense.""


""How about food for the people?"" Tiny Tip asked.


Ebenezer replied, ""Let them grow their own food.""


""How about decent health care for the people? Tiny Tip asked.


Ebenezer replied, ""Let them learn not to get sick.""


""What about jobs for people?"" Tiny Tip asked.


Ebenezer replied, ""Let them learn to be air controllers.""


Tiny Tip cried.


Ebenezer scolded him, ""It's Democratchits like you that have got us into the mess we are in.""


A week had passed. Ebenezer once again put on his coat and scart to face the bitter winter winds. He walked the empty streets on this cold Christmas Eve. He strolled past the deserted department stores where unemployed Santas stood outside their doors begging for pennies. The neon signs remained unplugged. ""Good,"" Ebenezer thought to himself. ""The people are conserving energy and since they are not buying anything, they must be investing. My plan is working."" He was tired. He decided that he had accomplished what he wanted to. He walked past an Asian storeowner putting an ""Out of Business"" sign on his store. Ebenezer paused to look at the storeowner. ""Bad management, no doubt,"" he thought. ""He's probably a victim of the free spending done by those Democratchits.""


Ebenezer walked into his white house. He felt sleepy so he decided to turn in. As soon as his head hit the pillow. Ebenezer was snoring. Little lambs crossed picket fences in his mind as he slept on. Suddenly, he sat up in bed awakened by a noise which he could not identify. It was a faint thud and clank sound, growing stronger, coming nearer. Ebenezer was a little scared, drawing his covers closer around him. The thud and clank drew nearer. A white haze permeated Ebenezer's bedroom. It slowly took shape. Ebenezer recognized the figure standing before his bed. The shoulders were hunched, the arms were outstretched with fingers on each hand pointing upward in a vee sign and a tape recorder was attached to his feet. It was his old California political partner, Jacob Milhaus. ""Ebenezer,"" Milhaus wheezed.


""I thought your political life was dead,"" Ebenezer cried.


""Ebenezer,"" Milhaus continued. An eighteen minute gap followed. Then Milhaus spoke up again. ""Ebenezer,"" he moaned, ""you cannot fool the people. You are making a big mistake if you think that you can. I should know, I was caught trying to slip some water under a gate. When the clock strikes the hour for three consecutive hours, you will be visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future."" The voice grew weaker. ""Ebenezer,"" the voice grew fainter, ""listen to what they say, go to where they go, and do as they command."" The voice was almost a whisper. ""I am not a crook.""


Ebenezer was alone in the room once again. He sat in his bed. ""Got to stop eating jelly beans,"" he thought. ""It's giving me some strange dreams."" He turned over on his side and, once again, drifted off to never-never land.


The clock in Ebenerer's room struck one. With a loud ""bong,"" Ebenezer woke up. He could feel an ice cold breeze against his face. He clutched his bed covers. A bright light glimmered, growing larger as it approached him. Ebenezer had to close his eyes. When he opened them, he was faced with the ghost of Herbert Hoover the Ghost of Christmas Past. ""I remember who you were,"" Ebenezer said to the figure standing before him. ""You were President of the United States during the Depression."" The ghostly figure beckoned Ebenezer to follow him.


Suddenly Ebenezer found himself at the back lot at MGM. He remembered his carefree days at the old movie studio. He looked around him. There were all of his old pals -- Joan Crawford Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper. He stopped and called to them. They didn't respond, they couldn't see him. A familiar face walked by him. He called out, ""Bonzo, don't you recognize me?"" But the chimpanzee kept walking, not conscious of Ebenezer. The Ghost of Christmas Past took Ebenezer by the hand and took him outside the lot.


Ebenezer walked with Ghost of Christmas Past, chatting to the silent figure that glided beside him. ""I remember those days, What fun everyone had. Movies were a dime in those days. Not like today."" Ebenezer rambled on but the Ghost did not respond. The Ghost took Ebenezer past the soup lines of unemployed people, the dry dust bowls of migrants travelling aimlessly, the ghettos and tenements of the poor, and the factories where children worked to support the family. But Ebenezer couldn't see what was before him. He rambled on about his glory days as a movie star.


The clock struck two. With two loud ""bongs,"" Ebenezer sat up in his bed, realizing he was in his old white house. ""Damn those jelly beans,"" he said. ""I've got to get some sleep."" A bright light glimmered, glowing stronger as it neared him. He shut his eyes. When he opened them, he was faced with the ghost of David Stockman, the Ghost of Christmas Present. ""I remember you,"" Ebenezer cried out. ""You were my budget director until you gave that interview to that magazine. Why are you the Ghost of Christmas Present when you have no future in my administration?"" Ebenezer asked. The ghost of David Stock man spoke up: ""It's a trojan horse. I didn't know what I was doing. I wanted to cut defense spending."" The ghost of Christmas Present beckoned him to come with him.


Ebenezer followed him. He followed him past the long unemployment lines, past the old people asking for medical aid, past the crowds of demonstrating people, past the union picket signs, past the crazies who needed help past the racists burning crosses, past the empty condominiums, past the starving babies, past the television preachers sermonizing against gun control. He told the Ghost of Christmas Present. ""It'll get better. Everyone will have a job. The private sector will take care of the old, the sick, and the young. Wait til the interest rate goes down."" But the Ghost of Christmas Present replied, ""It's a trojan horse.""


The clock struck three. With three loud ""bongs,"" Ebenezer once again sat up in bed. He saw the glowing light coming toward him. He had to shield his eyes. It was the Ghost of Christmas Future. Ebenezer recognized the figure standing before him Dressed in full battle dress, with medals shining, brass polished and swords drawn, it was the General. Alexander Haig. ""General,"" Ebenezer said, ""it looks like you're dressed for war."" The Ghost of Christmas Future did not respond. He beckoned Ebenezer to follow him. The Ghost of Christmas Future did an about face and began marching out toward the bedroom door. Fbenezer stepped in behind the General and started to follow him. The Ghost of Christmas Future stopped at the door and motioned Ebenezer to open it. Ebenezer opened the door.


Over at the house of the Democratchits. the folks there were opening what little presents they had. Tiny Tip looked at the barren Christmas tree. He whispered softly to himself, ""Merry Christmas, God help us every one and all.""

James Doi has been Dean of the College of Education at the University of Washington since September, 1979. He is the first minority dean appointed at the University of Washington.


He has impressive credentials among which are Assistant Chancellor for the New Mexico Board of Educational Finance System. Associate Provost at the University of Colorado, and Dean of the Graduate School of Education and Development at the University of Rochester. At the University of Washington, Doi oversees a college of 76 full-time professors servicing 1250 students.


Doi brings enthusiasm and a high energy level to his job. He loves his job even during these difficult times of large budget cuts in higher education. ""To me work is my play,"" he said. ""I really enjoy going to work. I've been fortunate because I have been at good universities.""


Doi likes his job at the University of Washington because being a dean he has the opportunity to bring in new ideas, and work with a strong sense of commitment to education. Doi sees himself in a role similar to a symphony conductor who works directly with the performers to create a work of art in educational programs.


Originally from Stockton, California, Doi grew up on a farm and went to a small rural school of 80 students. Later he was one of thousands of Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II. Doi spent one and a half years in the concentration camp at Rohwer, Arkansas. In camp he was the news editor of the newspaper, Outpost:


'During the last half of World War II. Doi joined the Army. ""I was in military intelligence in the Philippines, ""he said. ""I was a translator, interpreter, and interrogator, just like a lot of Nisci. After the war. Doi became part of General Douglas MacArthur's staff in Tokyo. ""I was part of the Civil Information and Education Section which dealt with educational reform and social reform,"" he said. ""I worked with Japanese educators, the Ministry of Education, and publishers. I was involved in rewriting textbooks used in universities and colleges.


""We reviewed materials, taking out statements which were biased against Americans and white foreigners and also those items that encouraged militarism."" The work he did at this time with educators helped foster his interest in educational reform.


After military service. Doi attended the University of Chicago and earned a Master's and Doctorate, marking the beginning of a very successful career in higher education.


Why did Doi accept a job in Seattle when he could have had a position at several major institutions in California? ""I wanted to go to a major university on the West Coast, but not in California,"" he said. California reminds him too much of World War II and the evacuation, he said. He also wanted to become involved with Asian American students. Doi has a strong interest in minority students, and in the universities of the Midwest and East he came to know many Black, Hispanic, and Native American students. But he has never had an Asian American student.


Doi found the opportunity to work with Asian American students at the University of Washington. ""Asians comprise the largest single minority group in the College of Education,"" he remarked. There are 51 Asian graduate students out of a total of 842, he said, and many of these students can be found doing advanced work in educational psychology and curriculum and instruction. In the undergraduate program, 16 of the 381 students are Asian.


Since coming to Seattle, Doi has also become active in local and national Asian American education activities. This year he was a keynote speaker at the national convention of the National Association for Asian and Pacific American Education. Doi spoke about the underre-presentation of Asian Americans in educational administration.


""I look upon schooling today as at a major turning point in its history,"" he said. ""We have devoted almost a century and a half to developing a universal, common school system. We have trained all kinds of teachers, we have trained many administrators, but there are a lot of things we haven't learned to do well. We have yet to learn to really infuse schools with quality."" Doi believes colleges of education will become more selective in their choice of students for teacher certification programs. The products of teachers colleges will need to be more analytical and innovative, he said.


""I would advise against anyone going into education unless that person really wanted to be a school teacher,"" he said. ""A person should not go into school teaching because it is a nice thing for young people to do when they cannot think of much else to do with a college degree. One must have a sense of commitment because without commitment there is no personal growth. And without personal growth there is very little satisfaction.""


Doi added that the University of Washington College of Education is becoming more and more selective in its admissions policies. In 1971, the college had 2700 students in its education undergraduate program. In 1982, that number will drop to about 200, signaling a sharp change in program emphasis.


The College of Education plans to become more research oriented, more concerned with problem solving, and more in volved in innovations. Doi carefully pointed out that the college will be involved in ""research that will lead directly towards improving our schools. We will be working more with school teachers and more directly with school personnel. In Seattle we have a tremendous natural laboratory to see how its rich mix of peoples can be brought to live in harmony together and with mutual respect for cultural differences. So the College will continue to give strong emphasis to multiethnic education.""

Instead of waiting and waiting, Oriental food can now be served in less than thirty, seconds. At Happy Bowl Corp., A Japanese fast food restaurant, as soon as the customer orders, gets the drink and pays, the beef bowl of beef strips and onions in sauce over rice is ready to be picked up.


Manager Noriyuki Sakaki said that Oriental fast food is not only quick and cheap, but heartier than hamburgers. He said the reason for serving it as fast food is to offer Japanese food at a reasonable price. The beef bowl costs $1.99 and the Happy Bowl set consisting of beef bowl, salad and beverage is $2.61.


""We don't offer atmosphere, so you don't pay for it,"" said Fumihiro Saitoh, assistant manager. The restaurant has seating for 46 people in plastic booths typical of fast food places.


Its location at 1325 Third Ave., across from the post office, is appropriate for serving fast food. There is a lot of foot traffic due to a bus stop. Many of the customers work in the downtown area. During lunchtime from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. there are not enough seats so some stand or else order out.


The idea of an Oriental fast food restaurant is not new. It is very popular in Japan, Sakaki's homeland. Half a year ago, he came to Seattle to set up Happy Bowl Corp. which opened in May. ""The Japanese prefer the sauce to be sweeter,"" explained Sakaki. ""They have more rice and less beef since in Japan, beef is more expensive than in the U.S. Americans like their beef to be saltier."" About 80 per cent of the customers are white. Many come back, even ""the next day"" Saitoh said.


At Happy Bowl Corp, the beef is cooked in soup from a powdered base ordered from Japan. The soup contains soy sauce, wine, barbeque sauce, onion powder, and other seasonings. The restaurant uses about 150 pounds of sliced short rib daily. Beef is kept simmering at 80 o C in a pot that has 50 servings.


There are two pots which keep the rice warm, each containing thirty bowls of rice, and also two rice cookers. Since everything is already made, all that needs to be done is to scoop up the rice and beef from the soup. More beef is added when the soup begins to look thin.


The salad contains lettuce, cabbage, a slice of lemon, and rice sticks (py mei fun). The house dressing is made of vinegar and soy sauce which can also be used for the beef bowl. Another condiment is sliced red ginger.


The menu is simple for easy operation. Six people are required to work during lunchtime; otherwise two or three can manage the restaurant. Hours are long: 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekends, requiring two shifts.


Sakaki works about 12 hours a day, six days a week. He plans to split the staff in half when Happy Bowl Corp opens a second restaurant that will probably be in the U. District or on the other side of downtown near the monorail. He hopes that this will atract more people to Oriental fast food.

When Rep. John Eng, whose district includes the International District, agreed this session to sponsor a bill to change a bilingual education law he helped pass two years ago, he got more second glances from constituents than in all of his more than eight years as a state legislator.


The attention has helped his cause, Eng says.


The bill responsible for putting Eng on the hot spot in the Asian community is House Bill 243, introduced by Rep. Helen Sommers, D-Seattle. The bill would eliminate the requirement that school districts provide bilingual education for students who need it. Instead, schools would have to provide ""intensive English"" programs to steer students toward English proficiency.


Dr. Larry Matsuda, supervisor of bilingual programs for the Seattle School District, agreed.


Matsuda said Eng ""took a little different tack because he's in the minority"" in the Legislature. Eng co-sponsored the bill, Matsuda said, to have a say on it.


""In order to influence a decision, he had to be a part of it, which is true,"" Matsuda said.


""Other people view what he did on the surface -- and that doesn't look like it's totally for bilingual education. But you have to recognize the context.""


A lobbyist who is against the bilingual education bill said he sympathized with Eng.


""Here's a guy who's done a lot of things for the community but has never heard much back from them thanking him,"" the lobbyist said. ""Now all of a sudden everyone's mad at him.


""He thinks he's doing the right thing, but others can't see that.""


Shaking his head after another trying committee session on the bill, Eng said he does not understand much of the opposition to the bill.


""People are confused by the bill,"" Eng said. ""Regardless of how terrific a program is, if there's no money, you won't have much of a program.""


Sommers hinted that intensive English programs would not be as costly as bilingual programs.


""I hope it will be a more efficient way to provide services,"" Sommers said. ""We would need fewer bilingual instructors because the focus would be on learning English.""


Eng said he is not worried that the bill could cost some teachers their jobs.


""My purpose has never been to create a job,"" Eng said. ""I am not interested in teachers' employment in this case. I am interested in seeing that a child be given this help he needs.


""If it so happens that teachers fit into this, then they can have their jobs.""


But Eng says he does worry that students in bilingual programs are not getting the help they need.


""A bilingual program should help a child become proficient in the English language,"" said Eng, who grew up as a bilingual child. ""Whether we like it or not, we live in this country. We are going to make it our home, and we are going to have to use the English language.""


Money for students in intensive English programs would be provided for two years instead of the three years allowed under the current law, and the push would be to get students competent in English as quickly as possible.


Eng has received calls from all over the state, he said, from people angered by his support of the bill.


Protests at a hearing in Olympia in January resulted in amendments to soften the bill when the House Education Committee picked up the subject again this month. Eng seems eager to please the superintendent of public instruction and others who are concerned that the bill would end state bilingual education programs.


Eng says he never expected such extreme reaction to a bill that he says is not such a big deal.


""I haven't gone around counting votes because I don't care whether or not the bill passes,"" Eng said. ""What I want may have been accomplished already.""


What Eng wants, he said, is money for the state bilingual program which, along with other state programs, has hit hard times.


The superintendent of public instruction's office has asked the Legislature to pay $11.7 million to fund the state's bilingual programs for the next two years a hefty increase over the $6 million the Legislature allotted the program two years ago.


Gov, John Spellman's budget allots a little more than $9 million for bilingual education, but a Republican-controlled Legislature is carefully scrutinizing Spellman's budget, searching for ways to trim spending even further.


Sommers said she expected this Legislature to at least match the $6 million that bilingual programs got last time and probably give out a bit more. But not even the SPI counts on getting the full $11 million, a spokesman for the office said.


Eng says that bilingual education may get more money because of the bill whether or not the Legislature goes for the idea. Sommers said she has the votes to get it out of committee, and chances are good that it will pass the House.


""What's interesting is that if this bill passes, there's still the assurance of funding because we took an interest in creating a good law,"" Eng said. ""If we say no to the bill, we are also saying people want the program we have created.


""There's interest in this area, and people have shown strong interest.""


Ironically, Asian community interest has pinned Eng in a corner, and some contend that Eng is trying to talk his way out of a tough spot.


""We could have fought for the same amount of money regardless of whether there was a new bill or not,"" said Liz Dunbar, director of the state Commission on Asian American Affairs.


Dunbar said she was afraid the bill would hurt state programs.


""The program is really working well now -- it could be a really negative thing to introduce any changes,"" Dunbar said. ""It raises a lot of questions and causes a lot of confusion.""


While Dunbar said she understands Eng's reasons for supporting the bill that ""to a lot of people looks like an attack on bilingual education,"" she said she does not agree with Eng.


""He seems to really believe that if he hadn't signed on to this bill, then the whole program might have been shot down,"" Dunbar said. ""I don't think that would have happened.""


But Rep. Art Wang, D-Tacoma, said he thought funding for bilingual programs would be threatened if the bill is passed.


""Passage of this bill could be seen symbolically as yet another attack on bilingual education,"" said Wang, who helped get bilingual programs off the ground in Tacoma five years ago.


""The bill weakens the subject so there's an excuse to cut programs either immediately or possibly in the future if the political climate changes,"" Wang said.


Keith Crosbie, coordinator of bilingual education in the office of the superintendent of public instruction, said he thought the state would not have to change much if the bill passed.


""So it seems unnecessary to have a new bill to tell us to do something that we have already been doing,"" Crosbie said.


Crosbie said that while he did not understand Eng's support of the bill, he did not think Eng wanted to see bilingual programs end.


""I know that he's been a supporter of bilingual education before, and I am assuming he still is,"" Crosbie said.

While legislators and social service agencies debate the value of bilingual education, for Mrs. Ching Shu Ma's students, ""bilingual skills are useful.""

Most speak Cantonese with a few speaking Mandarin and Vietnamese.

In a bilingual class, she continues, students can learn quite a bit if they work hard. ""They may be able to go to a regular class in one or two years with no problems if they work hard.""


""I will explain to them in Chinese and ask them to read individually,"" commented Ma. ""Since I have a small class, I can correct their pronunciation. After that, I always let them make sentences using the words I think are important for everyday use.""


The students are asked to memorize two or three lessons each day. Ma reads to them and the student listen and write.


These high school aged immigrants pick up English much slower than elementary school kids who can learn by playing with other kids after class, said Ma. ""Younger kids don't need bilingual education as much as high school students. High school kids are more shy and don't say things people might not understand. Text books and subjects are much harder in high school. They cannot adjust.""


Leng Ing, a senior with one year of bilingual education has to make the transition to a regular class. ""In these regular classes you have nobody to help you,"" Ing said. ""You have to find out what things mean by yourself. It's harder, a lot of the work I've never seen before.


Roughly half of Ma's algebra class works after school. In her other classes, they all work.


Ing works an average of six to eight hours each weekday, working at a Chinese restaurant from 5pm until midnight.


The students have opportunities to use conversational English at work, Ing said. ""They always use English in the restaurants. No Chinese come there."" Ma says students get along much better when they work, picking up English much faster.


They often have to choose their time wisely, working often means less time for studying. ""They study hard,"" Ma said, sometimes studying until one or two o'clock in the morning.


For Mrs. Ma, teaching bilingual students often means playing the role of social worker and/or counselor. Students often ask her to help them fillout job applications, welfare forms, and even make doctors' appointments. ""One student told me to tell her dentist not to pull out her front teeth,"" Ma said. ""She wanted to leave it. They can't communicate. Sometimes I even bring the students to a free clinic to have their eyes examined to get them glasses, because they don't have transportation.""


""I'm proud of them, they work really hard,"" she said. ""They think bilingual skills are useful.""

Unfortunately, by the time you read this article you will have lost the opportunity to view ""Children's Art of the People's Republic of China"", an art exhibit at the Wing Luke Museum.


For those of you who did see it . . . unbelievable, wasn't it? A very extraordinary array of art works that belie the artist's true ages, ranging from 7 to 18 years old.


There are no words which can truly describe the brilliance of this art collection. To understand the enthusiasm generated by these works you must have viewed them yourself. You would have been astonished by the quality of the exhibit and even more astonished by the maturity of the artists.


Collected by Charlotte and Rudy Pribuss, the 42-piece collection includes calligraphy, cut-outs, tempera and water-color. It is now a traveling art show, having been donated to the Smithsonian Institution, on exhibit throughout the country. Sponsored in Seattle by the University of Washington East Asia Resource Center and the Seattle Regional China Council of the Asia Society, the exhibit features objects showing a mastery of traditional Chinese methods and techniques and the influence of bold social realism poster styles.


Several of the works in the exhibition will be featured on UNICEF cards in 1982.


As a wise man once said, ""In children we can see visions of tomorrow and in these visions we can see the hope of the future.""


For more information, call the Wing Luke Museum, (206) 623-5124, or drop in at 414 8th Avenue South.

About 250 dignitaries, residents and community activists gathered in Hing Hay Park on September 25 to witness a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the grand opening of the Bush-Asia Center.


The $3.5 million renovation, not quite complete by the time of the grand opening, was lauded by Ben Woo, chairperson of the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), as the product of joint federal, city and private financing.


The PDA, chartered by the City in 1975, took on as its first project for revitalizing the International District, renovation of the historic Bush Hotel into a community center for the multi-ethnic International District. The Hotel was constructed in 1916 to accommodate railroad travelers from out of town.


Woo noted that the PDA received its charter during the term of Mayor Wes Uhlman. ""Entering into a contract with the City is like dancing with a fat lady."" Woo jokingly remarked. ""She's very graceful and she knows the music, but you just have to watch your step."" Woo, apparently, was alluding to excessive bureaucracy involved in obtaining $735,000 in block grant funding. Woo also credited four banks--Sea-First, Rainier, People's and First Interstate--with pumping $2.2 million into the project. Woo cited numerous public officials for their support of the Bush Hotel project, but both City Council President Paul Kraabel and U.S. Congressional representative Mike Lowry passed the credit back to the community activists who initiated the idea and carried it forth.


The lower three floors of the Bush Hotel contain offices for community social service organizations and commercial shops offering authentic Asian products including various gifts and food. The top four floors are retained as low-income apartments for residents and hotel rooms for travelers.


Several of the commercial shops in the Bush-Asia Center were not yet open for business by the time of the grand opening, but all are expected to be open by the middle of October.


Tours were conducted for guests at both the grand opening as well as the open house the following day. A Chinese lion dance was performed both days to chase away evil spirits.


At the open house. International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) Director Bob Santos recounted the work that went into making the PDA a reality. He said Norris Bacho approached him in 1973 or 1974 with the idea of starting a PDA to help rehabilitate the International District. ""He said to me, 'Uncle Bob, we're going to have a public corporation like they have down in Pioneer Square.'"" At the time, Santos said, he thought Norris was crazy.


But the idea took form as he worked with Susie Chin, the first office manager for Inter*Im, on developing a charter, Santos said. He thanked individuals--including Shigeko Uno, Tomio Moriguchi, Ted Choi, Bruce Chapman, James Mason and Al Kurimura--for their role in the Bush Hotel renovation, and ""last, but not least"" the residents for whom the top four floors have been preserved as housing.


Senator Henry Jackson, who also spoke at the open house, noted that when he was a student at the University of Washington, he enjoyed coming down to the Bush Hotel and Bush Garden Restaurant.


""I'm proud of the International community,"" he said.


Jackson, one of the forces in Washington D.C. who helped push for federal funding for the Bush project, alluded to recent federal cutbacks: ""I hope the federal government will be here in the future. We have some interim problems. Some things got out of line. But that doesn't mean you throw the baby out with the bathwater.""

In 1979, Shobun-sha, a Japanese publishing house, released its translation of John Okada's No-No Boy, a postwar novel about a Nisei's return to Seattle from prison after having refused to serve in the U.S. Army. Yo Nakayama, the translator, visited Seattle last year on his way to a linguistics conference in Toronto. The publishing history of No-No Boy in Japan has not been much different from its history in the U.S.; both editions went into second printings before they made any impact.


No-No Boy was first published by Charles E. Tuttle Books in 1957, and this first edition was translated into Japanese. Not much is known about what happened to this first translation.


What happened to the American printing? Fifteen years after its publication, the first run of 1,500 copies had not sold out. Things began to change when writers Frank Chin, Lawson Inada, Jeff Chan and Shawn Wong rediscovered No-No Boy in the early 1970's and recommended it to whoever would listen. The first edition sold out and became a collector's item. The four writers then formed CARP (Combined Asian American Resources Project) and published No-No Boy themselves. The new edition has since gone through more printings with the University of Washington Press. The popularity of the book is a far cry from its original appeal, as evidenced by a letter from Tuttle Books to CARP: ""At the time we published it, the very people who we thought would be enthusiastic about it, mainly the Japanese American community in the United States, were not only disinterested, but actually rejected the book.""


The CARP edition of No-No Boy eventually found its way to a coffee house library in Kyoto, Japan. Honyarado was built by a collective who got together in the early 1970's. Since its opening. Honyarado has become a major cultural gathering place. Many of its members are writers and educators who make numerous trips abroad and return with books in foreign languages that have interested them. Most of these are left in an informal library in the coffeehouse. It is here that Yo Nakayama chanced to pick up No-No Boy one day: ""Once I started reading it. I couldn't put it down and read late into the night. I thought it was a great book and I wanted to translate it.""


Nakayama had just finished translating. The Collected Lyrics of Bob Dylan with his friend Yuzuru Katagiri for Shobun-sha. It was this publishing house that brought out the second Japanese edition of No-No Boy in 1979. Since then, it has gone into a second printing. Well-known Japanese writers, such as Makoto Oda and Kenzaburo Oe, have praised it both in print and on radio and TV. A 1979 poll of ten major Japanese writers in a well-known literary magazine found No-No Boy listed as one of the favorites with two, an amazing accomplishment considering the sheer number of books published in Japan in any given year.


It is not easy to say exactly why No-No Boy took off in its second printing. The 1970's saw a renewed interest in Japanese abroad. Movies about Japanese living abroad in Brazil and Southeast Asia also gained national attention. One such movie, based on Tonoko Yakazaki's Sandakan #8 Brothel, achieved commercial and critical success. Recently a Japanese film crew came to Seattle to film a TV movie based on the life of Waka Yamada, a former prostitute turned social activist. Noted screenwriter and director Shindo Kaneto wrote a book, well received by critics, about his reunion with a sister who settled in California and was interterned at Manzanar.


After the publication of No-No Boy in Japan, Nakayama formed the Institute for Japanese American Literature. The Institute now has the largest library on Asian America in Japan and publishes a newsletter than lists the latest titles in English and Japanese on the subject of Japanese and other Asians living in the Americas.


With the relative success of No-No Boy. Nakayama now wants to translate Carlos Bulosan's America is in the Heart. His publishers are watching carefully the success of No-No Boy and have told him that, if it continues to sell well, they will consider other Asian American titles for the Japanese market. It has been a long time coming but it looks as though John Okada's book has finally been welcomed back both here and in Japan.

Meetings have been held with Inter*Im the International Drop-In Center, Chinese Information Services Center and the Chinatown/ID Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) to plan the formation of one Congregate Meal Program at the Bush Community Center. The PDA will sponsor the Meal Program which will include the Drop In-Center lunch program the CISC Congregate Meal Program and Inter*Im's Emergency Meal Voucher Program.


This is not a new development since plans to incorporate the nutrition programs were a foregone conclusion when funds were appropriated to build the Community Center in 1973. The Congregate Meal Program funding has the full support of the city through the Department of Human Resources.


As of now there is no date targeted to begin the meal program because of the uncertainty of the Community Center Kitchen completing construction and becoming fully equipped. The PDA hopes to complete the kitchen by August 1981, but delays in construction may delay this date so in the meantime everything will remain operational.


So until further notice, all meal programs including the Emergency Meal Voucher Program will be continued.


Many of the elderly are concerned that they might be losing their nutrition programs but realistically combining the programs will enable us to operate with the same amount of dollar allocations and expand the basic meal program because of the elimination of overhead costs.


An advisory board is being formed with representation from Inter*Im, CISC, ID Drop In Center, the CIDPDA and individual participants of the programs.


In order for this consolidation to be a success, the support of all the residents and interested community persons is important.

What can we expect from Ronald Reagan's administration? And what is Reaganism as it translates into domestic and foreign policy?


Reagan's election came as a surprise to many of us. But as with Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and now Carter, the finicky electorate has rallied behind or decisively discharged presidents at the social, economic and political whims of the times. But Reagan's victory wasn't inevitable. Even during midsummer 1980, the big business barometer. The Wall Street Journal, noted that between Reagan, Carter and Anderson, it was still ""none of the above.""


But most significant is Reagan's explicit aim of reversing the Democratic liberalism ushered in by Franklin Roosevelt nearly half a century ago. And despite the Executive Office's limitations (inability to control private oil or auto prices, a powerful Senate, and interest rates set by the Federal Reserve), Reagan is powerful enough to usher in changes coined as Reaganism.


He said it clearest on January 20. ""Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.""


He continues: ""We hear much of special interest groups. Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries, or ethnic and racial divisions; it crosses no political party lines. They are, in short, 'we the people,' this breed called Americans ..."" and ""Let's put America back to work.""


How does he plan to do this? First, by significantly reducing taxes to induce people to spend more and private industry to hire more, thus reviving the slipping economy. He also plans to roll back regulations on oil and gas begun under Carter, hold the line on hiring, and cut back on social spending.


Defense budget increases are promised, to no one's surprise. Carter was headed that way, but conservatives were frustrated with his not-swiftenough emphasis on reversing America's perceived image of vacillation and defeat in the Vietnam War, and in Angola, Nicaragua and Afghanistan. It's just more decisive now. Reaganism in foreign policy may aptly be described as ""The Empire Strikes Back.""


An example of Reagan's philosophy is his proposed tax cuts to private industry if they create jobs in areas of poverty and unemployment, called ""enterprise zones,"" and he may even offer industry sub-minimum wages for youth. This is in contrast to directing funds into more social and public programs.


Reagan's transition teams have been busy developing proposals ranging from getting government out of regulating industry (such as workers' safety protection laws) to backing off on social spending, but still favoring corporate industry (more federal dollars to aid the energy monopolies and continued support for nuclear power).


The effect of Reaganism on state and local government is yet to be felt. It will be quite a challenge for Seattle's traditionally liberal government to deal with. And the loss of United States Senator Warren Magnuson could also have an impact, especially in health care and assistance to the state's economy.


For local I.D. businesses, Reagan's proposed range of tax cuts could be beneficial. If they invest in equipment and expansion, tax cuts could be advantageous, according to a prominent I.D. businessperson. He felt that I.D. businesses should think long-term and invest in such things as computerized seating and accounting and such investments would be tax write-offs. However, as many I.D. businesses are small and family-operated, they tend towards traditional ""day-to-day"" operations.


Any way you cut it, Reagan has the job of closing the gap on growing unemployment and runaway inflation. Liberals and right-wing conservatives have different interpretations of what brought on such problems and what should be done about it. Clearly, the various hues of the Right lament that inflation is caused by idle industries, too much government intervention for the poor, and not enough emphasis on strengthening the U.S.'s strategic capacities and image abroad. Some (the New Right) go further to take up the mantel of stopping society's social and moral disintegration (anti-Equal Rights Amendment, anti-abortion, etc.).


It is beyond the scope of this article to adequately comment on the Right except to say that Carter stood somewhere in between. It was probably such ""indecisiveness"" that cost him the presidency, because the poor were getting poorer, the big industry was not rich enough (at least to receive enough incentive to provide more jobs) and the ""Middle class"" was feeling inflation too close to home.


It's no secret as to who Reagan thinks should sacrifice most, whether in the short run or long run of things. Either way, residents, small businesses, and social service agencies in the I.D. must all come to grips with the forecast ahead, some of us sooner and more painfully than later.

The act of giving is part of the holiday spirit, but giving occurs year-round at the Asian Resettlement Center, located in Bellevue. The Center operates clothing and furniture banks and collects food to aid Indochinese refugees who are trying to get settled in the U.S.


""Most of the donations for the banks,"" said Esther Ho, one of the Center's founders, ""come from the community such as churches and private donations and the Center itself survives by donations only."" Ho said she, along with Joanne Jones and Kathy Roll, started the Center a year ago because ""service agencies are usually in Seattle but there are hardly any on the eastside.""


Ten unpaid volunteers operate the Center located in the Hillaire School in Bellevue. Approximately 100 Indochinese refugees arrive daily to use the services and to receive job counseling and aid with filling out forms. Although very few of the volunteers are bilingual, refugees who have used the Center return to help as translators.


Others, such as the Brownie troops of Arbemore Elementary School, also have been affected with the spirit of giving. Ho explained that she was asked to suggest ways the Brownie troops could help the refugees and according to Ho, ""There was a tremendous response."" What started as a canned food drive extended into other projects initiated by the Brownies themselves such as collecting toys for the refugee children.


Making food baskets for Christmas is presently one of the main projects of the Center. Nutritionally balanced food baskets containing vegetables, rice, meat, canned foods and fruit juice from private donations and the King County Emergency Food Bank will be distributed to the homes of needy refugee families on the eastside which includes the Bellevue, Mercer Island, Kirkland and Issaquah areas.


""I've seen a lot of growth,"" said Ho. ""When some of the refugees first came here, they had nothing. But now they're settled and working and they're happy. To see that and to know you're involved with their progress is just so rewarding.""


Rewards came in yet another form for the Center. Earlier this year, when the Center was undergoing some financial difficulties, some of the refugees who had used the Center decided to pool their money and were able to pay for the Center's rent and telephone bill for two months.


If you would like to make donations to the Center, contact Esther Ho at 643-3558 or write. Asian Resettlement Center, 15749 NE 4th, Bellevue 98008.

""Pro racing is a hungry sport -- competitive,"" said Haruhisa Chiba, 29, a World Pro skiier from Japan.


Along with teammate Manabu Sawaguchi, 25, who recently turned pro, he participated in the Rainier Bank Cup at Crystal Mountain last month.


The Rainier Bank Cup is the 8th of 12 stops on a worldwide tour, where pro skiiers compete for top prize monies and points toward the World Pro Ski title.


Chiba said he finds World Pro ski competition tougher than his past experience, finishing 19th last season.


""If I win, I get more power,"" Chiba explains. ""If I lose, then maybe there's better opportunity in the next race (to win). It's kind of ecstasy when I'm down (lost a race) -- then I try harder (to win next time).""


In World Pro Ski competition, skiiers race in a head-to-head format, racing against each other and the clock. Racers are eliminated in a tennis-ladder style with the losers of each round dropping out and the winner advancing until there is a final championship race between the two remaining contenders.


""In the pros everyone has a chance,"" Chiba said. ""But in professional races there are 10 runs a day, so it's much harder than amateur (only two runs).""


Last year Chiba fell from a jump in Vail, Colorado, separating his shoulder, ""Sometimes it's very cold and painful,"" he said.


For Japanese skiiers who want to turn pro, it's hard to get ranked high enough to be recognized said Chiba.


""Japanese skiiers have to spend a lot of money compared to Americans, Canadians and Europeans,"" he said. ""They have to travel (further) because Japan doesn't have those races (needed to get World Pro Ski points).""


Chiba notices a distinct difference between American and Japanese skiiers.


""The style is much different but the technique is the same,"" he said. ""To the Japanese, style is always important. Americans don't care (about style) that much.""


Pro skiiers do a lot of travelling. Before coming to the U.S. this year, Chiba and Sawaguchi raced in Austria and Switzerland. Their next stop on the tour will be at the John Denver Celebrity ProAm in Heavenly, California.


Chiba and Sawaguchi ski nine months out of the year. In the summer they ski in South America and Australia. They train for two months, six days a week for about seven hours daily.


Self-taught skiiers, Chiba and Sawaguchi both started at three or four years of age. Chiba grew up in Sapporo, in northern Japan, where skiing is very popular.


Chiba said this will be his last year on the World Pro Ski Tour. ""Because next year I'll be 30,"" he said laughing. He said professional skiiers usually ski for about four to five years.


In the meantime his teammate Sawaguchi will try ""to make a name for himself,"" such as Chiba has for Japanese professional skiiers.


""I'm pretty famous in Japan, at least when you ask who the best Japanese skiier is,"" he said with a half-smile.


Chiba will spend more time with his company, ""Frontier,"" which specializes in ski promotion and development of ski equipment. The Tokyo company is three years old.


As far as results go at the Rainier Bank Cup, both Sawaguchi and Chiba were eliminated in early rounds of the giant slalom and slalom competitions. The winner of both events was Francisco ""Paco"" Ochoa of Spain.

The United States is assuaging its guit for involvement in the Vietnam war by bending over backwards to assist Asian refugees, and Leslie Yanover, a Vietnam-era veteran.


Yanover and other Vietnam-era veterans attended a city block grant preliminary meeting to support funding for the Seattle Veterans Action Center (SEA-VAC).


The City's Office of Policy and Evaluation (OPE) held an all-day meeting on July 7, 1981, at the Federal Building. The meeting was held to inform the community about the 1982 preliminary recommendations for block grant funding; and it was also an opportunity for the community to comment on those recommendations and to request funding. Over 40 participants, representing different interests and service agencies, attended.


SEA-VAC requested $125,000 and OPE recommended $40,000 funding. SEA-VAC provides employment services, counseling, discharge paper changes, and support advocacy for veterans. Not currently funded by city block grant money, SEA-VAC has been funded by the Veteran's Administration (VA) in previous years. But because of the cutbacks of the Reagan administration, the VA will end its support next year.


When the lower funding level for SEA-VAC was announced, irate supporters spoke up and a heated discussion ensued. Veterans claimed they were being discriminated against, citing how agencies serving mainly Asian refugees were getting more money than SEA-VAC which serves American citizens. They said it was no way to show appreciation to veterans who had served the United States. Referring to the Employment Opportunity Center (EOC) which serves many Asian refugees, one veteran said the could not understand how a refugee program could be funded at $130,000 and SEA-VAC only funded at $40,000. He said he did not know of any unemployed or unassisted refugee, but that he knew a lot of unemployed veterans.


Jackie Lum, OPE program coordinator, stated: ""The meeting was not for answering any societal wrongs or to change funding levels. The purpose of block money is to help specific areas of Seattle, specific kinds of services, and specific kinds of people. In particular, the purpose of city block grant money is for physical improvement, such as sidewalks and tree plantings for concentrated areas of the city. It can be used to fund social services that complement neighborhood improvement such as building up an area's employment, income and physical neighborhood. In this particular case, some of the persons served by SEA-VAC are not residents of Seattle.""


The Examiner spoke with two veterans who had attended the meeting to see if this was a case of racial prejudice against Asian refugees. But Leslie Yanover, interviewed two months later, reflected, ""We merely seized on the meeting as an outlet for our frustrations and anger."" Refugees are ""driving new cars, getting new homes, and have government assistance while veterans are not given such ""exceptional treatment,"" he said.


Asked whether SEA-VAC's priority service is counseling, Yanover said ""Personally, I feel that Vietnam veterans cannot get too much counseling."" He said a lot of veterans needed counseling before they went into the military and a lot more needed it after they got out. ""SEA-VAC,"" he said, ""deals with small groups of people and thus deals more effectively."" Besides counseling services, Yanover said SEA-VAC has job listings and placement services, can change discharge papers if they are faulty, and offers peer support.


""We are people just like others,"" said Steve Early, who spent three years in the Marine Corps, eight months of which were spent in South Vietnam. ""We did what we were told. At the time, we believed we were doing what our government felt was right, and that it was something that would benefit the people of South Vietnam.""


During his first 48 hours as a civilian. Early encountered his first experience with prejudice. Boarding an airplane to his hometown, he asked a passenger sitting in his seat to move. The passenger looked his uniform over, refused to sit by him, and left -- calling him a ""baby"" killer and spitting on him.


""We came back and expected to be accepted, but we weren't,"" he said. ""I was 22 years old and this was the first time I had ever experienced prejudice. It really shocked me. (When I returned home) I was treated as some sort of despicable animal.


""War is hell, but you can't change what's already happened.


Refugees from Asian countries have been given assistance that ""I have been denied,"" said Early. He emphasized that his feelings of resentment are not racially motivated, but stem from the fact that ""some people are treated with greater deference than others.""


Both Early and Yanover have experienced the prejudice of people who are anti-Vietnam-era-veterans, and have felt the hurt and bewilderment of returning home from doing what they believed to be their duty for their country. They feel their experienced and feelings are typical of Vietnam-era veterans. They represent the lucky few who have managed to cope and adjust.

Employment Security's decision to recommend closure of a Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) station in Southeast Seattle will reduce CETA's service to the Asian community opponents of the decision have charged.


Congressional cuts have reduced the CETA budget for this region from $2.7 million to approximately $1.2 million for this coming year. The reduction in funds has prompted Employment Security to recommend elimination of eight of 12 CETA ""intake stations"" in King County, including the only one in Southeast Seattle. Counselors at those stations certify prospective employees as CETA-eligible and direct those clients into jobs with CETA-funded agencies.


The Consortium, the funding source and prime sponsor of CETA, is expected to decide later this month whether to accept Employment Security's recommendations on eliminating certain intake stations. Employment Security recommended retention of the intake station currently at Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center as the central station; clients formerly served by the Southeast station would be directed there.


The reduction in funds could also possibly result in the termination of all six Asian bilingual CETA counselors currently serving clients out of the Southeast station. Asian community advocates point out that the Indochinese counselors in particular have very low seniority and that, if firings are done strictly according to seniority many Asian bilingual counselors will be among the first to go.


Asian community advocates argue that the Southeast Seattle station should remain open because:


-- the immediate area it serves provides a more equitable racial mix. According to the latest Census figures, Southeast Seattle has the most diverse mix of minorities.


-- the station has historically provided more service and more referrals than any other station in the County including the greatest number of minority referrals.


-- the station is easily reachable by bus and would provide accessibility to CETA clients, many of whom travel by bus.


Steve McCallister regional director of Employment Security, said the recommendation to eliminate the Southeast station was based on an Employment Security demographic study which evaluated the various stations according to operational costs, transportation accessibility and ""the pockets of those in need who are served.""


McCallister said staff reductions will proceed on the basis of seniority. But he added, ""We are making up plans which will deal with the issue of how we can provide the same percentage of bilingual staff, both in the various Asian and Spanish tongues, within the requirements of the law.""


Lee Pasquarella, director of the Consortium, said a decision whether to eliminate the Southeast station would come later this month. It could be either a board or administrative decision. he said. The decision, he said, will be based on factors such as the population surrounding the stations, accessibility and use.

Employment Security retains Southeast CETA station


Following protests from representatives of Asian social service agencies, Employment Security will retain a Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) station in Southeast Seattle.


Employment Security had earlier recommended elimination of eight of 12 CETA ""intake"" stations for King County, including the station in Southeast Seattle which provided comprehensive bilingual services to CETA-eligible residents of Asian/Pacific ancestry.


Counselors at CETA intake stations direct CETA-eligible clients into jobs with CETA-funded agencies.


Social service proponents in the Asian community, protesting the possible elimination of the Southeast station, said the station had provided significantly greater service to CETA-eligible residents than any other station in King County and is practically the sole referral source for the Asian English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program.


Seattle Mayor Charles Royer, in a meeting with Employment Security in late August, directed Employment Security to look at alternatives which would allow for retention of five rather than four intake stations, in order to continue one station in the Southeast.


Congressional cuts had reduced by over half the CETA budget for King County, prompting the cutback in the number of stations.


According to Linda Cannon, of the City's Office of Intergovernmental Relations, the plan will now be to retain five intake stations -- each staffed by five persons.

The dust has settled once again as the political circus left town after its annual November run. Election Year 1981 is over, with the winners licking their chops and the losers licking their wounds. This year, the script did not run true to form -- favorites were beaten and surprising upsets took place.


King County Executive: Ron Dunlap, the incumbent raised more than three times the political campaign funds raised by his opponent, former City Council-person Randy Revelle. Pre-election polls showed Dunlap ahead by an overwhelming edge. Dunlap, himself, boasted that he would get twice as many votes as his opponent. But on Election Night, Ron Dunlap got a ""revelle-ation."" Almost immedaitely after declaring himself the winner, Dunlap watched his early lead drop until he was behind. Ron's problem was that he watched too many Seahawks games. Borrowing a campaign strategy from Seahawk Coach Jack Patera, Dunlap couldn't score when it counted . . . in the fourth quarter. In short, he pulled the ""Big Choke."" That's two years in a row for Dunlap. In Election Year 1980, Dunlap, running against Representative Mike Lowry, carried a lead into the night, then lost it. That makes Dunlap 0-2 in the standings for the last year. As for Randy Revelle, he claims that he has not lost an election since high school. He beat the favorite, the polls, and the odds.


Initiative 394 -- ""The WPPSS Measure"": Initiative 394 was a measure to require voter approval on spending limits for energy projects. Anti-394 forces, including Big Labor; nuclear power advocates, labor contractors, and corporations, raised more than 10 times the campaign funds raised by the pro-394 forces. Some commentators noted that to be pro-394 meant ""anti-nuke,"" and anti-394 meant ""pro-nuke."" Others called it the WPPSS (Washington Public Power Supply System) bill. The anti-394 forces hired a Beverly Hills ad agency which had never lost a political election -- until now. WPPSS went ""whoops."" Washington voters are a friendly sort -- they just couldn't say no. The pro-394 forces prevailed and the Initiative passed. But this contest isn't over -- Washington voters who voted yes could still be ""nuked."" The anti-394 forces are planning to go to court to test the constitutionality of Initiative 394.


Mayor of Seattle: The Charley and Sam Traveling Salvation Show went from neighborhood to neighborhood in search of a listening audience. It wasn't much of a surprise that Charles Royer received almost three times as many votes as Sam Smith. Royer said afterwards that he was surprised at the winning margin, figuring that Smith would be the beneficiary of anti-Royer votes. Getting almost 75 percent of the vote as the incumbent mayor running against an established City Council member could be interpreted in two ways: either 75 percent of the people who voted were pro-mayor and liked what he was doing, or 75 percent of the people who voted were anti-City Council and didn't like what the City Council was doing.


Galle v. Moffett -- City Council: This race should have been billed as the ""mom and apple pie"" contest -- Bob Moffett, the cop, against Virginia Galle, the girl scout leader. Bob Moffett made a crucial error. He called a press conference, presented a proposed budget, and then, when questioned, proceeded to fall flat on his face when he could not answer specifics about the eight-page budget which he distributed to the press. Galle, on the other hand, chose not to say anything about the City Budget. Galle remembered a key political truth which Moffett forgot -- sometimes the wisest thing to say when you don't know is not to say anything. So, it's back on the beat for Constable Bob. And yes, Virginia, there is a City Council.


Chow v. Fletcher -- King County Council: It was often hard to determine the favorite in this particular campaign -- incumbent Ruby Chow or her main opponent, the anti-Ruby Chow forces. In both the primary and the final election, both major newspapers supported her opponents -- Ron Sims in the primary, Paul Fletcher in the final. Fletcher's showing in the final (8,000 votes) more than doubled his showing in the primary (3,500 votes). Nevertheless, his surprising showing may be attributed not so much to the strength of his candidacy, but to the ""anybody but Ruby"" campaign waged by Ms. Chow's opponents. Ms. Chow survived the challenge and will serve another term. Fletcher, on the other hand, has yet to prove that black Republicans are a major political force in this area.


Friedlander v. McManus -- Port Commissioner: With a name like Captain as his real first name, McManus certainly had the most colorful name on the ballot. A Captain as your Port Commissioner. But that was all he had. Friedlander won rather easily. Port Commissioner, however, is not a high visibility political race. Besides, it only pays $1 a year.


School Board Races: Congratulations to Rasmussen, Michael Preston, and T.J. Vasser. It really takes some type of person who willingly wants to deal with cutbacks in school funding, hassles in school desegregation, public criticism over school closures, endless meetings, reductions in force, and school discipline problems. On second thought, maybe someone should congratulate their opponents for losing because they can avoid these conflicts. One thing is for certain, nobody will criticize Rasmussen, Preston, or Vassar as high-paid bureaucrats for winning this election. This office pays $1 a year less than Port Commissioner.


Doug Jewett v. Doug Jewett -- City Attorney: I bet a lot of people forgot that Doug Jewett, City Attorney, was running for re-election. So did a lot of his opponents -- no one filed against him. With such an opportunity for over-confidence, the only person who could have beat Jewett was himself. Needless to say, Jewett ran a low-key campaign. Along with the judges, his name was probably the least mentioned on Election Night. Of course it was a foregone conclusion: he won the minute the time for filing ended. He was one candidate who did not have to wait for the polls to close -- or open for that matter.

Play apparatus, trees and benches are part of the new International Children's Park in the International District Construction of the Park began in late October and will be completed in May.


The park consists of the following play apparatus: a straight slide, a spiral slide, a miracle whirl and a bridge over a rock mountain which sways when walked upon. There is also a covered umbrella-shaped pavillion with neon tube lightning in the roof.


A bronze sand dragon created by Gerry Tsutakawa sits in the park. The architect for the project was Joey Ing and Associates with Tom Berger, and landscaping was done by William Yurozu.


Buddy Brown, project manager of the Parks Department said, ""It's a lovely park ... well landscaped and it has passive seating space too.""


Cost for the Park was $186,000. The con struction was funded by City Block Gran money with a matching grant from the Inter agency of Outdoor Recreation.


Al Kurimura, Dept of Community Devel opment. Project Manager for the Inter national District commented about the Park ""It is very important to the District, particularly at the (south end of the District). It pushes the residential character further south and helps to tie in some of the residential housing by Maynard and Weller . . . I'm really excited by it.""


However one ID resident observed that ""the number of kids in the District has decreased dramatically from when the idea for the park was first probosed 8 or 9 years ago especially since there's no housing for families.


A dedication ceremony is scheduled for late May or early June.

International District agencies which receive funding under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) have been informed that federal funding cuts will force an end to CETA public service jobs, effective the middle of this month.


The CETA program, which provides funding for staff positions in many key. International District social service agencies, had been slated for elimination at the end of September. However the Reagan administration has hastened the shutdown of CETA by reducing the program funds by 40 per cent retroactive to October 1, 1980.


The Reagan administration's conservative economic program calls for a major diversion of funds from social need programs to programs for the military. The scrapping of the 200,000 CETA public service jobs is coupled with a Reagan proposal to replace major categorical federal programs with locally-administered block grants. According to the administration proposal, the federal programs would be lumped into four consolidated block grants -- preventative health services, health services, social services, and energy and emergency assistance -- to be administered by the states and funded at 75 per cent of the 1981 service level.


The International District Improvement Association (Inter*Im) and -- to a lesser extent -- the Chinese Information and Service Center (CISC) rely on funding from the Community Services Administration (CSA), which the Reagan administration is seeking to abolish. The Economic Opportunity Act, which provides a federal mandate for the existence of the Community Services. Administration, expires at the end of September.


CISC, which is a United Way agency, also recently lost four CETA positions. Other agencies stricken by CETA cuts include: the Denise Louie Childcare Center, International Drop-In Center, Asian Counseling and Referral Service, and International District Community Health Clinic.


There is almost no prospect that the U.S. Congress will restore CETA funds; and the announcement that the funds would cease in May was greeted as an inevitability, although the cuts leave the Childcare Center and the Drop-In Center the most short-handed.


Reagan's consolidated block grant proposal has become the centerpiece of the battle over reduced spending levels for community social service agencies.


Like Inter*Im and CISC, the Health Clinic relies on federal money which, under Reagan's proposal, would be replaced with the block grant for health services, to be administered by the State.


Bill Hobson, director of the Central Seattle Community Health Centers, said that the states -- including Washington -- have had a poor track record in providing primary health care programs for the urban poor. ""The states may decide to fund local and state health departments rather than these primary health services,"" Hobson said. ""We can't expect anything good to happen at the state level."" He added that the State Department of Social and Health Services, which would be charged with administering the health services block grant under the Reagan proposal, is only ""in the beginning stages"" of formulating a mechanism for allocating the health services funds.


Curiously, although Reagan has released a draft of the proposal for the consolidated block grants, no legislation has yet been introduced in either house of Congress providing for implementation of the program.


Meanwhile, a House committee earlier this month, by a surprising vote of 24 to 8, reported out of committee a bill to reauthorize the Economic Opportunity Act for another three years. The full House is not expected to vote on the reauthorization until sometime this summer, according to one committee aide.


In another surprising move, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill to fund the Legal Services Corporation for $260 million. The Reagan administration has called for the abolishment of Legal Services. According to a House aide, who asked not to be identified, the bill was a compromise measure receiving bipartisan support. The Senate Judiciary Committee had earlier voted approval for a bill to reauthorize and provide Legal Services with $100 million.


According to the House source, the House version ""adds language to enable the board of Legal Services to interpret guidelines on the bringing of class action suits initiated by Legal Services."" Opponents of Legal Services have criticized the agency for initiating class action lawsuits. The board, which would be comprised of 11 members appointed by Reagan, would presumably set the guidelines for Legal Services, according to the House source.


Inter*Im Director Bob Santos had earlier told The Examiner that if Legal Services were abolished, his agency would lose access to three attorneys who provide assistance with economic development, housing and land use planning. ""The District would be losing a great deal of assistance that can't be duplicated by any public or private agency,"" he said.


Inter*Im, which receives all its operational funds from CSA, will be asking for pledges from community businesses as a match for possible foundation money. ""If the community feels we're needed, then we hope they will want to contribute to keep this going."" he said.

The experiences of Chinese men and women detained at the Angel Island Immigration Station from 1910 to 1940 will be documented by the Angel Island Film Project, sponsored by the Chinese Historical Society in San Francisco.


Project Director Felicia Lowe, a San Francisco filmmaker and former television journalist, has begun research for the film. Lowe produced the award winning film, China: Land of My Father.


The Island, located in San Francisco Bay, was used for the detention of nearly 200,000 Chinese who awaited clearance of immigration papers from 1910 to 1940. The Chinese were subjected to racially disciminatory immigration regulations beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.


""Everyone has heard of Ellis Island, but Angel Island remains virtually unknown to the vast majority of the population,"" said Lowe. ""With this film, we intend to expose the history of the Angel Island Immigration Station and the racially discriminatory laws which affected the treatment of the Chinese immigrants whose papers were processed there. Perhaps people will begin to understand how these first experiences on American soil by our fathers, mothers and forebearers influenced our communities.""


Immigration authorities began to use Angel Island to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country. Many Chinese jumped off ships at ports, crossed borders of neighboring countries and entered with false papers is ""paper sons"" Chinese American citizens returning from a visit to China, would report the birth of children. Slots would then be created for those wishing to pay to emigrate to the United States, and they would enter as paper sons. After arriving, immigrants would be kept from parents, relatives and friends while being subjected to long detailed interrogation sessions in an effort to detect those immigrating illegally. The average stay on Angel Island was several months. Some stayed two to three years.


During their stay on Angel Island the detainees suffered crowded living conditions, lack of privacy and feelings of isolation and abandonment.


As a result of the immigration laws, the population of Chinese in the United States decreased from 105,745 in 1880 to a low of 61,639 in 1920. Few Chinese were allowed to enter; those still in this country either passed away or returned to China.


The Angel Island Film Project is looking for persons with information about the Island and people who may have stayed or worked there. Visual materials such as still photographs and 8mm 16mm or 35mm film footage are also needed to help audiences better understand the physical setup of the Immigration station.

Tony Baruso, President of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 37, was arrested and subsequently released in connection with the slayings of two union officials.


Baruso was arrested on the afternoon of July 13 on suspicion of homicide and suspicion of conspiracy to commit homicide in connection with the June 1 slayings of Gene Viernes, the union dispatcher, and Silme Domingo, the union's secretary-treasurer, according to Seattle Police homicide detective Sgt. Don Cameron.


A gun, believed to be the murder weapon, was held as evidence.


Lt. Robert Holter of the Seattle Police Department said, ""We had more than sufficient evidence to arrest Baruso. We felt that the physical evidence as well as the evidence surrounding that physical evidence more than strongly supported the arrest."" He said Baruso's release doesn't mean that he would not later be charged in connection with the murders of Domingo and Viernes.


Sgt. Cameron also confirmed that the police is continuing its investigation: ""It's possible that other arrests would be made and it's possible that they are union members.""


At a July 15 press conference held in the Local 37 union hall, Tem Mast, a member of the union's executive council and Domingo's widow, read a prepared statement: ""We consider the arrest and evidence brought by the prosecutor's office against Tony Baruso quite serious with widespread implications for our union. Presently, the Executive Council is continuing to make assessment of the impact of this arrest on the ongoing work of the union."" Mast said an internal investigation will proceed on ""possible offenses which may bring harm or discredit to Local 37 or its members. Tony Baruso's activities will be investigated based upon specific charges stemming from his possible involvement in the slayings of brothers Domingo and Viernes.


Viernes and Domingo, both 29, were gunned down June 1 inside the union office at 2nd Ave. S. and S. Main St. Pompeyo Benito Guloy, Jr. and Jimmy Bulosan Ramil have been charged with aggravated first degree murder in both deaths.


Domingo and Viernes, at the time of their deaths, held key positions in the Local 37 and were in the forefront of a movement to reform the 1,200 member union.


The deaths of Domingo and Viernes have provoked grief and outrage within the Filipino and Asian communities in which the two men were deeply involved. Over 150 people turned out June 22 at the Local 37 union hall to launch the work of the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes. Members from the Filipino Community, Asian community, labor unions and solidarity movements pledged to support and actively participate in the committee, which has urged all ""concerned for decency and justice to come forth with any more information on the suspects or others, no matter how insignificant ... We need the collective and individual acts of courage if we are to stop this violence and seek full justice for the murders ...""


""Only through an organized effort and strong community support for a full investigation can our community fight intimidation and violence by criminal elements,"" said a committee spokes person. Anyone with any information concerning the slayings are encouraged to contact the King County Prosecutor.


At Local 37, reform efforts continue. The union recently sent two investigation teams to check on working conditions and enforce contract agreements in the unionized canneries. Mike Withey, the union's attorney, was part of the first investigating team which went to five different canneries. ""The industry was not real happy to see us,"" Withey said, ""but the membership wanted to hear what was going on surrounding the shootings, and we received a lot of support for our efforts to strengthen the union.""


At the union hall, dispatching for the salmon season was completed last week, said recently designated dispatcher John Foz. ""We're now pulling together some of the grievances we have related to dispatches and terminations by the companies,"" he said. The union recently filed a grievance over the firing of two union members at the Peter Pan Fish Cannery in Dillingham, Alaska. The union's grievance stated that ""both men had good work records and no just cause exists for their terminations. The foreman initiated and recommended the termination for reasons of personal bias.""


Also, in a reform effort which has paid off, said Withey, Local 37 won an important decision against the Alaska Packers Association (APA) which will have a significant impact on the contractual rights of Local 37 members. Last year, according to Withey, the APA, which has its cannery at South Naknek, Bristol Bay, violated its collective bargaining agreement with the union when it had decided not to hire Local 37 members who had first preference status (i.e. who had worked the previous season at the company's cannery) and, instead, hired inexperienced Alaska residents.


""It frames some important questions,"" Withey said. ""Are they (the industry) going to let the ruling stand -- a ruling which implies that the entire Alaska fish canning industry must employ all Local 37 members who have first preference status before hiring any Alaskan residents and are they going to try to throw out the Local 37 dispatch system in future contract negotiations?""


Meanwhile, Guloy and Ramil will go on trial August 6 on charges of aggravated first-degree murder. At the July 7 pre-trial hearing before presiding King County Superior Court Judge Terrence Carroll. King County Deputy Prosecutor Joanne Maida said the state's position is that the shootings were a single act rather than part of a conspiracy, she added, however, that evidence of ""a common scheme or plan is still being developed. The state, she contended, filed aggravated murder charges because there was more than one victim in the crime. The state has asked for life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Judge Carroll has set a pretrial hearing date of July 28 to establish the groundrules for the trial. A decision will be made at that time on a motion to move the trial to another county because of defense lawyers claim of adverse publicity for their clients.


The Federal Bureau of investigation, meanwhile has officially entered the case and is looking into possible civil rights and labor violations, according to assistant Special Agent George Fisher.


In another development, a proposal to rename the first three floors of the Bush Community Center in the International District the ""Domingo/Viernes Community Center"" was voted down by the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) Council at its last regular monthly meeting.

The president of Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU), charged by union members with manipulating votes in recent elections held by the Seattle-based cannery union, will stand trial August 15 before a court of his peers.


President Constantine ""Tony"" Baruso has been charged with fraud in regard to his role in the recent elections for the International Executive Board of the ILWU. The ILWU-International is represented by the locals on the West Coast from Alaska to California and in Hawaii.


Terri Mast, a member of the ILWU Local 37's policy-making executive council, brought the charges against Baruso when she was informed by the ILWU International that Baruso had received 420 Local 37 ""votes,"" the total votes allocated to the union; however, an election, scheduled at all ILWU locals between June 15 and 19 to vote for representatives to the ILWU International, was ""never held"" at Local 37, according to Mast. ""None of us had voted,"" she continued, ""so we assumed no election had taken place but Tony said that the election had been held when I asked him about it."" Mast then checked with the International and was told that it has received the 420 ballots, all of them with Baruso's name on them in the same handwriting.


The Examiner was unable to contact Baruso for comment on the charges of fraud at press time.


Baruso was recently arrested and subsequently released by Seattle police in connection with the slayings of two Local 37 officials. Silme Domingo, the Union's secretary-treasurer, and Gene Viernes, the union's dispatcher, were gunned down June 1 inside the union office at 2nd Ave. S. and S. Main St. Pompeyo Benito Guloy, Jr. and Jimmy Bulosan Ramil have been charged with aggravated first degree murder in both deaths and are awaiting trial, now scheduled for August 10 at 9:30 a.m. in the King County Courthouse. Baruso was arrested because a gun registered in his name was determined to be the murder weapon. The prosecutor's office, however, determined that at present, there was not enough evidence to charge Baruso with any crimes.


The charges of fraud against Baruso in the ILWU-International elections will be heard before a committee of five union members selected through a name drawing mechanism. Mast will prosecute the case. ""After listening to both sides,"" Mast said, ""the committee will caucus, determine a verdict"" and if Baruso is found guilty would recommend the type of punishment. That recommendation would be brought before the entire membership for a vote. Punishment would be a monetary fine suspension or ouster. Should he lose, however, Baruso could appeal the decision ""all the way to the next International ILWU convention"" scheduled for April, 1983, Mast said.


The union trial, which ""won't take more than a day,"" Mast said, would be the first in 25 years. ""We are now holding people accountable to union principles."" Mast said. ""And this means anyone would be prosecuted all the way if they violate this union's constitution. We are just reinstituting the democratic process of the union.""


After the August 15 trial, Baruso may also have to stand trial for involvement in the deaths of Domingo and Viernes. ""We are investigating his involvement in the matter,"" Mast said, ""to determine if he had withheld any information to the police and prosecutor's office."" According to Mast, the union's executive council had voted to fully cooperate with the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes in bringing forth any information or evidence that might aid the prosecution's investigation.

Third of a three-part series


Elder members of the Chinese family associations say that younger Chinese Americans, reared in a different time and setting, hesitate to join the associations. The older generation is concerned about the survival of the associations.


The associations, which join families sharing the same surname, provide assistance and social activities for their members. Historically, the associations helped Chinese immigrants upon arrival in this country.


Hing Chinn, president of the Gee How Oak Tin Association, said a major problem is lack of communication between different generations of Chinese Americans. ""It's difficult for the second generation to communicate with the older people because of the younger people don't understand or aren't fluent in Chinese,"" Chinn said.


Fay Wong, advisor in the Wong Association, said younger people have their own ideas. ""It's difficult to get them to join,"" said Wong. ""I don't question that but you need to give them time. If you bring them when they're young, they'll get used to the associations. After they get a little older and more serious, they'll know the association is important.""


Wong cited himself as an example. Although Wong joined at the age of 30, he didn't find time to get involved with the association at that time. I didn't do anything except pay dues and vote,"" he said. He went on to serve as president of the local chapter for a total of four years.


Another member of the Wong association, Rodney Wong, is an example of a second generation American-born Chinese that the associations want to recruit. Three years ago, Wong became involved with the association because ""a lot of my uncles are involved,"" said Wong.


Wong, who is from Hawaii, has established a law practice in the International District. He says the Wong Association has helped him meet people and get started in business. He sees the Association fulfilling a traditional role: ""As an outsider coming into town, that person would be able to contact his chapter, who would take him in as a brother."" He added that his involvement in the Association is ""also a way to learn how to speak Chinese.""


Wong said the difficulty that the associations have had recruiting members of the younger generation is, ""symptomatic of all organizations,"" not just family associations. ""Whether it's Chinese or Japanese or anything else,"" said Wong, the interests of parents and their kids are not the same. There is a generation gap, Wong said.


Jesse Eng, member of the Eng Association, echoed this sentiment: ""The younger generation keeps away from the family associations. In any society, not just Chinese, the young people go away from the mainstream of family structure. I'd like to see the generations together, but that's a dream.""


The younger generation, said Eng, ""always goes forward, they never look back.""


Danny Woo, an elder in the Gee How Oak Tin Association, says the family associations are less vital than in the past.


""Not very many native-born join,"" Woo said. ""They feel they don't need any help -- they can help themselves. People are more independent than in the old days.


""I've tried to encourage the native-born Chinese to join, but it's an awful time to get new members in. The future doesn't look too good to me.""


For the elderly, the family associations continue to serve a social function. The associations are also a place where elderly, because of Chinese tradition, are given great respect. Fay Wong recalled an instance in which the assocation cared for one of its older members:


""The association helped this old member who was in his 80's and lived alone in Chinatown,"" Wong said. ""Many times he was hungry and another member would help feed him or bring him food. When he died, the association buried him because he didn't have a family. The association sticks together.""


Chinn remembered a time when the association was asked to serve as a go-between in a dispute between a father and son. Chinn admits that some internal problems can't be solved by the Association but it ""tries to help out with family problems.""


One Association member, however, commented on the lack of involvement by the associations in community issues, including issues that affect the elderly. ""I don't see any involvement in community activities like housing in the International District,"" the member said. ""There are a lot of property owners in Chinatown. They should fix up the property.""


Difficulties in school or other problems faced by kids and teenagers haven't been brought to the association. ""We don't have that kind of problem come to us,"" said Fay Wong, ""but if it did, we would try to figure out something.""


Taking a different approach to attract younger people into the association. Chinn asked teenagers at the graduation tea what improvements could be made. ""Some said maybe the association could throw a dance or something,"" said Chinn. ""Times change and you've got to change ideas. Like any organization, you need to get something interesting for them to join.""


To some, the family associations are a place to learn about one's culture. ""I want to have the family associations so that you can know your ties and roots,"" said Woo. This interest in one's culture, Chinn says, is responsible for the increasing interest in the Association.

As the Washington State Legislature winds down its regular 1981 session, the budgetary ax continues to hang precariously over the state's commissions on minority affairs. The Commission on Asian American Affairs, which speaks for Asian concerns in Olympia, along with the Commission on Mexican American Affairs and Office of Indian Affairs, will get, at the most, $350,000 for the three commissions combined for the 1981-83 biennium, says Elizabeth Dunbar, Director of the Commission on Asian American Affairs. The state house, however, may trim that senate-approved amount to $250,000, which would be ""unacceptable,"" Dunbar said. ""That would be a signal to us that they don't really want to give us any money at all."" Dunbar expects a final decision at the end of April.


According to Dunbar, the $350,000 is already far below the $600,000 requested by the three commissions and well below the 1979-81 operating budget of $450,000. The $350,000, if approved, would be ""the bare minimum,"" Dunbar said. ""We're certain to have to curtail a lot of our activities. It would be enough to allow us to operate while we look for other sources of funding. The indication I've got is that the senate will prevail.""


The major effect of the cutback would be the loss of the Commission's coordinator for Indochinese refugee affairs in the state. She hopes to get other fundings to continue the position.


Also, the 24-member commission will be cut in half, Dunbar continued. ""That would mean less contact in terms of statewide representation.""


Dunbar says the commission's branch office located in the International District will close. Under the new budget, the three minority commissions would share office space in Olympla. Dunbar, however, stressed that it's important ""to be accessible to the Asian community, which to a great extent means King County.""


On the question of effectiveness, Dunbar said, ""It depends on what people expect of us. There are certain things we are effective at."" Dunbar said that as a state agency, the commission has to tackle issues on a statewide basis. ""That is the useful role we can serve,"" she said. ""We can't address individual problems. We have to work on a larger scale and on a more indirect basis."" Dunbar sees the commission's role as a go-between between state government and local Asian communities, which includes working with the governor's office, the legislature and other state agencies. ""All these groups need to hear that there are issues, such as bilingual education and busing, that are of concern to the Asian American community, and that is a very difficult and long and slow process."" Dunbar stresses that the grassroots Asian American community has to be better organized and be visible to get the recognition from the state legislature. The legislature ""doesn't see us as important. We are insignificant in [the legislature's] eyes. We have to do something to change that image. This legislature has just been brutal to the poor and to the people of color.""

""We have earned this victory, we have earned this justice."" says Elaine Ko, co-chairperson of the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes, a group which played a key role in helping convict two men of the murders of two local cannery union officials.


Six men and six women jurors, on September 24, found Jimmy Bulosan Ramil and Pompeyo Benito Guloy, Jr. guilty of aggravated first degree murder in the June 1 shooting deaths of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, reform-minded officials of Local 37, International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, the Seattle based union.


The seven-week trial, which the prosecution called just the ""the tip of the iceberg,"" was a complicated, sometimes bizarre case which established the existence of high stake gambling in Alaska's salmon canneries and in Seattle's International District, included the arrest of an alleged gang leader and the implication of the union president in a murder conspiracy. Defense attorneys produced a surprise witness who admitted, upon cross-examination, that at one time he had delivered Howard Hughes' ""Mormon will"" to a former gas station attendant, a will later declared a fake.


The jury deliberated 14 1/2 hours before bringing in a guilty verdict the evening of September 24. Guloy's mother, in the hallway outside the courtroom when the verdict was read, broke into tears. Ade Domingo, mother of Silme Domingo, reached down to touch Mrs. Guloy's hand. ""I was really deeply touched by her."" Mrs. Domingo recalled later, ""by her love for her son. I could not help but try to communicate with her. I too had lost a son.""


Attorneys for Ramil and Guloy said they would appeal the decision. Both men face life in prison without the possibility of parole. No sentencing date was set.


During an exhaustive 10 hours of closing arguments by both the prosecution and defense, King County prosecuting attorney Joanne Maida reviewed the testimony of an estimated 80 witnesses and stressed that Domingo's identification of Ramil and Guloy as the assailants, given to firemen who jotted the names on a piece of scrap paper, was not to be taken lightly. It is upon his strength, his integrity that the case is built on, Maida said.


The prosecution concluded that Domingo and Viernes were killed because their efforts to reform the backward and corrupt system of dispatching workers to jobs in Alaska's seafood processing canneries were hampering the gambling activities of a Filipino gang known as the Tulisan, which emerged during the trial as the force behind a scheme to control gambling in Seattle's International District and the Alaska canneries.


The killings, which happened in broad daylight, were intended to be a power statement to the Chinatown community, the prosecution contended. Ramil and Guloy, Maida said, were the hitmen acting on the orders of others. She linked them to Fortunado (Tony) Dictado, the alleged leader of the Tulisan. Dictado was arrested and subsequently charged with aggravated first degree murder in the deaths of Domingo and Viernes. His trial is scheduled for October 26.


The defense attorneys, meanwhile, had called 17 alibi witnesses to establish that Ramil and Guloy were nowhere near the murder scene. Ramil and Guloy also testified in their own defense. In closing arguments, the defense attempted to cast doubts on Domingo's ability to identify his assailants because he was severely wounded and argued that 17 defense witnesses could not all be wrong or lying about Ramil's and Guloy's whereabouts during the shootings.


Maida; who was the last to speak to jurors, argued that based on all the testimony, there was no question Guloy and Ramil committed the murders and that Domingo knew what he was saying when he named them as his assailants.


Maida also attacked the credibility of defense witness LeVane M. Forsythe, who had come forward during the last week of the trial to testify that neither Ramil or Guloy were the men he saw running from the murder scene. The 58-year old construction project manager's testimony contradicted the state's witnesses who testified that the victims knew their attackers and that Domingo told a medic and fireman the defendants were the ones who shot him. Forsythe, who said he talked to the wounded Domingo outside the union hall before firemen and medics arrived, testified that Domingo told him he didn't know who shot him.


In cross-examination, however. Forsythe admitted that he once testified under oath that he was a courier for Howard Hughes and delivered the fraudulent ""Mormon will"" to a man called Melvin Dummar. The will purportedly Hughes design for disbursing estimated assets of between $169 million and $2 billion, was found at the Mormon church headquarters in Salt Lake City shortly after Hughes' death in 1976. The will named Dummar as recipient of one-sixteenth of the assets. Dummar later said it was delivered to him by a mysterious courier from Hughes. A jury ruled in June, 1978 that the will was fraudulent.


In closing arguments, Maida attacked Forsythe as a Martian, a chronic publicity-seeker and phony. He may have even been a ""contracted professional witness."" said the Committee for Justice.


The conviction of Ramil and Guloy by no means ends the case, both the Committee for Justice and the prosecution agreed. The upcoming trial of Dictado according to Committee for Justice spokesperson Elaine Ko, may lead to other arrests, particularly of Tulisan gang members.


The committee, formed to aid the prosecution in bringing forth witnesses in the case, had developed and worked with the prosecution on the ""criminal enterprise"" theory to explain the murder motive. The theory is that three interlocking interests worked in coordination to ensure smooth gambling operations in Alaska's canneries. The three components, which Maida explained in her closing arguments, were the complicity of corrupt union officials security and protection from gangster elements and profits from 'gambling itself Gene Viernes, by instituting a fair dispatch system in Local 37 threatened the smooth operation of this criminal enterprise, Maida said.


While one trial has ended and another scheduled to begin shortly, a federal grand jury in Seattle has been investigating alleged gambling and racketeering in Alaska canneries. Lynn Domingo. Silme's sister, last week testified about gambling and other union activities. Tony Baruso, Local 37 president, was also called to testify, but he reportedly pleaded the Fifth Amendment. Baruso had earlier invoked the Fifth Amendment in the trial of Ramil and Guloy. In July, he was arrested, but not charged because a gun registered to him was determined to be the murder weapon. Both Baruso and Abe Cruz, a long-time Local 37 union member will be tried by their peers for alleged vote tampering in an election of the ILWU International. ""Our union will not tolerate these corrupt elements in our ranks,"" says Terri Mast member of Local 37's executive board.

The Mayor's Task Force on Asian Community-Police Relations held a day-long forum Saturday. October 17, to discuss ways of improving relations between Seattle's Asian communities and the Seattle Police Department.


For the past three and one-half years, the task force has met regularly to discuss police community relations so that the community could be served better and so that the Seattle Police could enforce the law more effectively. The first community forum was held in June, 1978. The recommendations from that forum dealt with five key issues: bilingual services, recruitment, promotions and assignments of Asian officers, training, development of better Asian/police community relations, and Police Chief selection.


Some of the accomplishments from the first community forum are.


--development of a police services brochure translated into eight different Asian languages.


--increased numbers of Asians in the Police Department.


--increased number of officers with bilingual skills.


--and improved police training which includes culturally sensitive material.


The task force is composed of representatives from Seattle's diverse communities, the Seattle Police Department, Community Relations Services of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Southeast and Mt. Baker Youth Service Bureaus, the Mayor's Office for Senior Citizens, the Asian Counseling and Referral Service, the Employment Opportunities Center, Seattle Rape Relief, and Seattle Public Schools.


Mark B. Della, chair of the task force, states. ""The task force has been very instrumental in helping to bridge the communication gap which exists between Asians and the officers of the Seattle Police Department. The accomplishments of the task force during the last three and one-half years tell us that there are individuals in the community and in the Police Department who are willing to bridge the communication gap and work towards improving the rapport of the two groups.""


The keynote speaker for the forum, held at the Jefferson Recreation Center, was Waynette Chan of the Multnomah County Prosecutor's Office, who spoke on police services to the Asian communities in other cities. During the lunch hour, Municipal Court Judge Ron Mamiya presented personal perspectives on judicial procedures and the Asian community.


During the morning session, community panelists talked about various aspects of police relationships with the community. Representatives of the Asian elderly, the youth, newcomers and the Samoans expressed various concerns. The afternoon session consisted of a Police Department panel which addressed aspects of the Police Department, including the Crime Prevention/Witness Advocacy programs, recruiting, training, and patrol.


The final part of the forum was the small group discussions. In these groups, community people and police officers talked openly about individual concerns. Those concerns were listed and will be used as key issues for a new set of recommendations to be given to the Mayor's Office and the Chief of Police.

International District residents, merchants, property owners and those who have a strong interest in the area participated in three community meetings held in September and October, 1980 to discuss their ideas and concerns about the development in the International Special Review District. The Special Review District is administered by a seven-member board established by the City of Seattle. The Board is responsible for guiding and controlling physical growth and preservation according to a set of development regulations.


The development regulations must be revised to respond to the changing needs of the ID. The Board, along with the City, held several community meetings to obtain the opinions of the people in the ID to help the Board as it moves forward on revising the regulations. As a result of the meetings (one for each group: residents, merchants and property owners and community participants), a report ""Community Viewpoints"" was produced, presenting the ideas and concerns each group had about development in the ID as it affects certain areas and structures.


The development of the Union Station which is located on the western fringe of the ID, was one of the several issues discussed and examined by the groups. All groups agreed that the development of the Union Station should be compatible with the character of the ID. The Union Station has been in the news as a possible site for a transportation terminal serving the regional as well as local pedestrian and auto traffic coming into downtown Seattle. All groups favored a combination of uses that would meet the needs of the community: parking, housing, retail/commercial. Nearly all participants were opposed to manufacturing uses at the Union Station site, although some residents did not object to the concept. There was considerable disagreement within groups about the proposal to use the Union Station as a transportation terminal. Some felt that the terminal would stimulate economic activity, while others felt that it would cause increased congestion. Other participants felt that this use would alleviate certain parking and traffic pressures on the district and pre-empt the possibility of less desirable private development over which ID constituents might have less control.


Housing was seen as the most desirable development of the hillside area, on the ID's northern fringe. There was near consensus in all groups that some of the housing should be developed for middle income individuals, although there was high disagreement about development of low and high income housing. Residents were more likely to favor the development of low income housing, while merchants and property owners were more likely to favor high income housing on the hillside. Other hillside developments proposed included office development and a parking structure.


The Metro site at 8th and Dearborn was also examined for possible development. However, all groups agreed that the Metro site seemed to be the toughest to develop at the present time due to its location some distance from the active core of the district, the heavy volume of traffic and noise around the area and its proximity to industrial properties. Many participants felt that development of the 8th and Dearborn site should proceed slowly, allowing time for other district development to progress and for later development needs to emerge.


And finally, the groups discussed the future development of the International Special Review District. Within each group there was consensus about future directions for the District. However, there was little overlap in the focus or tone of discussion between groups. Community participants were more likely to specify potential development goals for the ID, while merchants and property owners discussed the need for further commercial development and parking. Residents were more likely to emphasize their social and service needs. All groups however, were concerned about traffic and parking congestion.


In January, the Board will begin discussions to revise the development guidelines. In additiona to the report, the Board will hold public meetings to hear further comments from the community. There will be a schedule of these meetings in the upcoming issue of the International Examiner.

The following is an analysis by the Anti-Martial Law Coalition in the Philippines, a situation which has been in effect since 1973. The coalition is composed of individuals and organizations including the Union of Democratic Filipinos, the International Association of Filipino Patriots and the Philippine Solidarity Network, who have all worked toward ending martial law and educating people about the Marcos' dictatorship and its impact on the Philippines' people.


On January 17, 1981, Philippines' President Ferdinand Marcos announced that he was lifting martial law after eight years of military rule. Although martial law has ended, Marcos' dictatorial powers remain intact. Marcos, while transferring his legislative powers to the Interim National Assembly at the same time warned this body that he is still the boss.


The majority of the body's 184 members are pro Marcos'. Of its 184 members, 169 belong to Marcos' Kilusang Bagong Lipunan Party (KLB) or the New Society Party. Not more than five are consistent opponents and the rest goes along with the majority.


The retention of Marcos' absolute power is legally ensured by the 1973 constitution he constructed. Article 17 (Section 3) of this constitution provides that: ""All proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President shall be part of the law of the land and shall remain valid, legal, binding and effective even after the lifting of martial law.""


This means that the more than 3,000 one man presidential decrees, general orders and letter of instructions which incorporate his absolute rule remain in force. Therefore, even without martial law,


Freedom of speech is still denied.


Freedom to protest, organize, demonstrate is still denied.


All communications media remain under government control and supervision.


Strikes are still prohibited, labor unions closely controlled by the government.


- Political prisoners can still be imprisoned indefinitely ""until otherwise ordered released by Marcos"".


- The courts cannot rule on the constitutionality of any of Marcos acts or those of his ""duly designated representatives"".


Only Marcos and the regular National Assembly he promised to hold election for 1984 can repeal or change these laws.


But, it is almost certain Marcos' KBL party will again control the 1984 National Assembly.


And to assure Marcos' continued rule after 1984, Article 8, Section 20 of Marcos' 1973 constitution empowers the prime minister to veto acts of the Assembly. The prime minister can also make laws by himself ""whenever the National Assembly is unable to act adequately"" on anything that ""in his judgment requires immediate action.""


Behind these legal dressings remains the fact that Marcos is in full control of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Through high salaries, business opportunities and promotions, Marcos has ensured the loyalty of its high-ranking officers, many of whom are his provincemates. This military machine, which Marcos as its commander-in-chief, retains powers of arrest.


Marcos is lifting martial law to retain the support of the U.S. The continued existence of Marcos' dictatorial regime depends upon U.S. aid. In exchange for acting as a security guard for huge U.S. investments and military bases in the Philippines, Marcos is kept afloat by U.S. aid and loans from U.S.-dominated banks and institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.


In 1980, foreign investments (U.S. and Japan) in the Philippines exceeded the annual average for the 1970s by 500%. The U.S. military bases in the Philippines, Clark Air Force Base and Subic Naval Base, have acquired tremendous importance lately as staging points for U.S. forays in the Middle East. Acting as a security guard aids Marcos' ambition for absolute power through which he can amass wealth.

The political process works in strange ways. In a time of severe budget slashing and government program cutback. Seattle's voters gave overwhelming support to an elderly housing bond issue which could very well serve as a model solution to the growing national problem.


But the bond issue, approved by a remarkable 80 percent of the voters in the September primary, was not enacted due to insufficient voter turnout. However, the voters have one last chance. In a special session held the day after the September primary, the City Council voted to place the issue on the November 3 general election ballot.


Though there may be some question about voter turnout in November, there is no debating the desperate need for housing assistance for low-income, elderly in Seattle.


The numbers are staggering. Currently, over 4,000 elderly households in Seattle at paying more than 50 percent of their incomes in rent. There are presently 1700 elderly households on the Seattle Housing Authority's (SHA) waiting list, and unless more housing is built, and built soon, the list promises to grow longer.


In the face of this housing crisis, the federal government has dramatically reduced funds for low-income housing. Last year, Seattle received 12 units of federally subsidized housing. Next year, the city expects none.


In May, 1981, Seattle's Housing Finance Task Force recommended that the City construct 1000 new units of low-income housing, 90 percent of which would be reserved for elderly citizens and 10 percent for the handicapped.


And according to Mark Stensager, director of People for Senior Housing, the low cost of the program helps explain the strong support from the voters in September. ""If the bond issue is passed, it will mean a very small addition in property tax -- roughly $17 per year on a $60,000 house,"" he said. Moreover, once construction is completed no new funds will be required because rents will cover all operating expenses.


Stensager adds that once private contractors, have completed construction, management will be turned over to the Seattle Housing Authority. ""The Seattle Housing Authority has a good track record."" Stensager says. ""As opposed to housing authorites in some other cities, the SHA's reputation remains untarnished by charges of mismanagement, insensitivity to neighborhoods and the lot. The SHA represents government at its best, and the people of Seattle know that.""


Housing construction would be primarily low-rise buildings with 20 to 40 one-bedroom units because these would be less costly than high-rises. There are also options for rehabilitation or building conversions. The program would not be restricted to any particular neighborhoods. Buildings would be distributed throughout Seattle.


As a provision of the bond issue, the basic rental charge would be set at 30 percent of the tenant's income. There would also be a minimum and a maximum rent, adjusted to reflect rising operating costs.


Though the bond issue is no panacea for elderly citizens besieged by record rates of inflation, a broad-based constituency believes that it is a sensible start in dealing with the housing problem. The long list of supporters of the bond issue includes several groups that are normally poised on opposite sides of the political fence. The Seattle Tenants Union, Seattle/King County Board of Realtors, League of Women Voters, Boeing Co., Rainier Bank Corp. and Community Home Health Care are a few of the organizations that have endorsed the senior housing bond issue.

""I do get satisfaction [being a fireman] . . . like when you save someone's life and they do become rehabilitated and recuperated,"" said Randy Foy, a firefighter paramedic with the Seattle Fire Department.


In 1970, Foy became Seattle's first Chinese American fireman. Explaining how he chose his profession, Foy said, ""A friend brought me in."" He said he thought it would be an exciting occupation.


He was able to pass the 5'8"" height requirement which was a handicap to many other Asians, who are, Foy said, ""characterized by their small-stature."" Since the civil rights movement, Foy said, the height requirement has been dropped and more minorities have been able to become firemen. Also, he said, certain rigorous requirements have been dropped so that women can try out.


Even though he was tall enough and in good physical shape. Foy said that recruit training was very arduous for him. ""[We had to] practice with the fire hoses ... making hitch-ups and practice using all the equipment ... ladders and chainsaws [used to cut holes in the roofs]."" said Fov. For firefighting practice, old vacant houses were set on fire and the recruits faced ""live"" firefighting conditions. Recruit training involved much heavy work and fatigue, and, of course, danger.


Foy wanted to become a fireman for many reasons. He said passing recruit training gave him tremendous personal satisfaction. His biggest motivator was the ""challenge of getting the job"" -- the physical challenge, knowing most of the competition was bigger than him, and knowing he was the first Chinese fireman in Seattle. Also, he said, the job offered ""good benefits, good job security, and pretty good pay.""


After completing recruit training, Foy was assigned to a fire station and served a one-year probationary period before becoming a full-fledged fireman with the Seattle Fire Department.


""Fighting the fire seemed like fun,"" said Foy, explaining his initial view of the job. ""You work hard fighting fire ... physically and mentally. [Physically] you feel the adrenalin going and you feel good that you stopped the fire. [Mentally] you have to pay constant attention and safety is a first thing."" He said he has to think about the safety of the citizen, his fellow firemen, and himself. Reflecting on his present view of firefighting, Foy said, ""It's scary. You can get trapped or fall through a floor."" He said there is always danger of burns and it is often hard to get rid of the smoke in your lungs.


In 1978, he earned a paramedic certificate issued through the University of Washington School of Medicine. Logging over 2000 hours of classroom work (lectures, studying, tests) at Harborview Hospital, Foy also had on-the-job training. He rode the Medic I units with a senior paramedic who supervised and advised him on how to treat patients. Also, before his paramedic training, Foy, as a fireman, went out in the first aid cars and treated patients. However, he said, firemen manning first aid cars can only do advanced first aid -- they cannot administer drugs.


Paramedics rotate their job locations every two days and work 45.7 hours a week. This way, Foy said, all the paramedics get an equal opportunity to get more medical training at Harborview Hospital. There are three shifts of paramedics, he said. The night shift works from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. and the day shift works from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The third shift is off. So, said Foy, he will usually work four days, take two days off, and work four nights.


Foy, 38, is married and has two boys. He said, ""[The boys] think it's exciting ... riding the fire engine, the noise..."" His family has become used to his working hours. ""But it's not easy,"" said Foy. ""Like when I'm on night shift, I'm away a lot."" Asked if the night shift is quiet and slack, he responded, ""It's more busy than it isn't.""


Explaining emergency runs, Foy said that the Medic I units can speed up to 10 miles over the legal speed limit. They must stop at all stop lights and stop signals, and they must be kept under control. If there is a jam-up on the freeway, the Medic I unit gets through by riding the shoulder, he said. ""A lot of people are very ignorant about what to do when an emergency vehicle is behind them,"" stated Foy. ""They should always go to the right.""


Being a paramedic is a hectic and rigorous occupation because a paramedic is always on the go, said Foy. There has been an increase in paramedic training, he said, ""because some men want to get out; they get burnt out.""


Death is a common sight on the job. Foy said that death is more often the case on his runs than saving a life. ""You see a lot of the sad part of life,"" said Foy, citing as examples -- a person shot and victims of heart attack, burns, car wrecks, and drug overdoses. ""You have to get used to it,"" he said, ""and I've learned not to let it bother me. [But] if you see children hurt, then the fireman really feels it. It strikes home. But it's part of living, part of the job ... people do die.""


He sees a lot of the elderly die, but, he said, he knows that they've lived a long, full life so it's not as heartbreaking as seeing a child die. One of the ""hardest to cope with [cases]"" is the sudden infant death syndrome. Foy said that there's nothing that can be done and so, in a sense, parents become the patients. Paramedies try to explain that nothing could be done and try to absolve the parents' feelings of helplessness and/or guilt. ""[In all the cases involving death] you talk to the immediate family and try to comfort them ... We go to their homes and inform them [about the death] and talk to them about it,"" Foy said.


Although he had to work hard to get the job, often encountering death, Foy said the job is worthwhile and gives him much personal satisfaction. ""If there are any young Asian kids getting out of high school [interested in fire-fighter paramedic work], contact me and I can give them some insight into how to become a fireman,"" said Foy, who can be reached by calling the International District Emergency Center at 623-3321.

Hito Hata was conceived, written, directed and produced by Visual Communications (VC), a Los Angeles-based production company whose core staff is made up of nine Asian Americans. Founded in 1970, VC has produced a wealth of resource materials on the history and experiences of Asians and Pacific Islanders in America through films, videotapes and printed materials.


Among VC's more widely acclaimed films is Wataridori: Birds of Passage, about the lives of three elderly Japanese Americans, which was chosen by the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. for a special showing during the Bicentennial Celebration. VC also produced Cruisin' J-Town, a film about the Asian American group, Hiroshima, who perform the original soundtrack for Hito Hata.


Through Hito Hata Robert Nakamura, the film's writer and co-director, and VC's other staff members hope to dispel false notions and stereotypes of Japanese Americans and portray their story faithfully and realistically. Nakamura states that he grew up with all the WWII films and a steady diet of anti-Japanese portrayals. ""One of the most interesting things -- it's distressing really -- is to think we've made progress. Then you go see The Deerhunter and you realize there hasn't been a change in Hollywood's perception of Asians since the war. As a film maker, I see its good points technically, but as an Asian American I feel it's racist."" The VC production attempts to ""show a people who are neither saints nor sinners, who were exploited and often exploited each other, who rebelled as well as acquiesced to oppression.""


Visual Communications funded the Hito Hata project partly through a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Office of Education received in 1978. However, the scope of the project and the inflationary costs of the film industry pushed production $100,000 over budget.


To help defray the costs, VC launched a fund-raising campaign in May 1980. Benefit premieres have been held in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Toronto. Plans are to carry the film to New York, Washington D.C., and other major cities before it is broadcast on prime time national television (PBS) this spring as part of a series entitled ""The Nation Builders."" VC has also made plans to release the film in Japan.


The Seattle premiere will be on Thursday, February 19, at 7:30 p.m., at the Toyo Cinema, 5608 Rainier Avenue South. Tickets for the premiere are $10.00 each. Follow-up showings will be held Sunday, February 22 at 2:00 p.m., and Monday, February 23, at 7:30 p.m. Tickets for the Sunday and Monday showings are $5.00 general admission; $3.00 for senior citizens and children 12 and under. Proceeds will benefit Visual Communications and Friends of VC Seattle/King Street Media Works. Donations are tax deductible. For ticket information, call 624-3925.

Being a musician is much more than getting on stage and performing, says Bob Antolin.


Antolin, 26, is interested in the different cultural roots of music. He is studying for his master's degree in enthnomusicology at the University of Washington. Ethnomusicology is the study of other cultures' music, excluding the traditional and classical forms.


He's played with several groups, including Deems Tsutakawa's jazz band and Alan Lau, a poet and writer. While accompanying poetry, Antolin plays, ""a whole different aspect of music not constrained to melodic highs and lows, but playing to another medium.""


Antolin, who grew up in Tacoma, hopes to have a career in music either teaching and/or performing; Antolin says working for his master's in ethnomusicology, ""you get to see similarities in music, the whole art form.""


""Through the ""music's eye"" you get to see the culture and being there would probably just enhance it.""


Antolin's music philosophy is best stated in a Christmas card he received from Lau, which said ""Music is a healing force of the universe.""


Antolin comes from a family with musical background and has been involved in music since he was 11. His father plays the violin, mandolin and guitar. His younger brother just started the piano.


Besides playing the sax and the flute, Antolin also plays the bamboo flute, percussion and the Filipino drum. He is also taking tenor and soprano sax lessons from Carter Jefferson, a musician from the east coast and is also learning the sitar and Thal flute, called an Ichaen, through a visiting Indian artist at the University.


Antolin says he ""possibly may go for his Ph. D. in ethnomusicology after getting his masters degree right now, he's ""just taking each quarter at a time.""


""Right now I'm just trying to survive,"" Antolin said, who is performing, composing, transcribing, learning instruments, working and going to school at the same time.

""Economics"" will determine whether or not the International Branch of the U.S. Postal Service remains in the International District, according to Ernie Swanson, U.S. Postal Service public information officer.


The Postal Service is leasing the building located on the Corner of Sixth Ave S and S King St. The new owner of the building (as of March 6) is the United Savings and Loan Association, which has its main office adjacent to the post office. The United Savings purchased the property for $668,250 from the William Chappell Estate Trust (doing business as the Rainier Heat and Power Company), which owned several buildings in the I.D.


Both parties, at this writing, plan to negotiate new lease terms when the current lease expires July 31, 1981.


""We bought the property in case of future expansion,"" said Derek Chinn Vice President of the United Savings & Loan Association. ""We don't need to expand immediately. Right now I would expect the post office to continue renting (the building) from us.""


However, according to Chinn, some years ""down the line we may feel this place (the current United Savings building) is too small"" and possibly building another structure or use the property ""for parking.""


""The dollar figure will determine whether or not we can economically (continue at the current location),"" Swanson said. ""Our real estate people will determine how much we can spend per square feet. If the negotiations are unsuccessful, we will have to find an interim facility.


""Although it's important to stay down here,"" Swanson continued, ""there isn't a great deal of property in the I.D. area (that could be purchased or rented). In fact, we are finding that, in Seattle, it's difficult to find a site we like.""


The Postal Service has been at the current I.D. location since 1956, according to Swanson. ""In terms of serving customers, it's an ideal location because it is in the heart of the I.D. and close to the businesses whom we serve. We will have to consider the impact (of the post office moving) on the community.""


The United Savings and Loan Association is a Washington State chartered bank with four branches, all located within the Seattle city limits according to Chinn.

Last January, a University of Washington committee announced a new admissions policy for disadvantaged and minority students trying to enter the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP). Group I students, those with a grade point average of 2.5 and above, and considered able to meet regular UW admissions standards, would be admitted without heavy paperwork. Students in Groups II and III, with grade points of 2.0 - 2.5, and below 2.0, respectively, would be evaluated by a committee consisting of three EOP staffers, two from the student's ethnic background, and two UW faculty members.


The new policy was the result of more than a year of turmoil surrounding the EOP. In the fall of 1979, Dr. Herman Lujan, EOP director, proposed a stricter admissions policy designed to raise the retention rate of EOP students, which he felt was too low. Local activists denounced the plan as elitist and unfair to academically needy students. They launched a campaign to stop it, climaxing in a series of sit-ins at EOP offices in May of 1980. At the height of the controversy, UW President Dr. William Gerberding stepped in and appointed the commission that recommended the new revised policy.


This spring, an enrollment ceiling of 1,157 (an increase of 84 from last fall) was placed on EOP enrollment for the fall 1981 quarter, a result of University budget restrictions. At the same time, an evaluation of the EOP led some University officials to state that the number of Group I students in the Asian division, who they contend do not really need the EOP, is too high. Assistant vice-president for minority affairs William Baker said that budget restrictions would force the UW to concentrate on the most academically needy students, those in Groups II and III. UW provost George M. Beckmann said many Asians do not really need EOP because they are ""highly motivated"" and ""come from intelligent families who emphasize education.""


""That is beside the point,"" countered Asian division director Jerry Shigaki. ""The Asian division is the largest in EOP, but historically, an Asian has never bumped another minority student off. Blacks, Chicanos, they all have the same opportunities.""


Shigaki feels that recent articles in the Seattle Times and Post Intelligencer about the Group I situation have unfairly focused on his division. ""These articles have looked at Asian Group I's only,"" he said: ""It is a complex issue, because this is the first year EOP is facing a ceiling, but you can't just concentrate on one division. You need to look at all Group I's cross culturally.""


""It is good for some Group I's to be in EOP,"" he continued, ""because they serve as role models for the others. Also, just because a student is Group I doesn't mean he doesn't need our services.""


Shigaki said that Asian division recruitment for the fall of 1981 is running ""about the same as last year"" 561 students, two thirds of whom fall into Groups II and III. This level of enrollment may not last, however. Assistant Vice President Baker has told the Seattle Times that ""we're moving toward a policy of limiting the number of higher achievers and that probably will hit Asians hard, because they've had a large number of high achievers.""

As the music drifts out of the storefront, the tempo, beat, instruments and mood seem familiar but the vocalist is singing in Chinese.


Chinese entertainment in the form of music, books and magazines and newspapers can be found at Far Eastern Imports, a book and record store located in the International District. Two years ago, Eddie Hui and his wife Maxine, started Far Eastern Imports, the second of the four Chinese bookstores in Seattle, because he felt ""there wasn't much entertainment available for Chinese people, especially for the non-English speaking.""


According to Hui's observations, the recently immigrated Chinese and Vietnamese teenagers and young adults enjoy the contemporary music the best. The most popular singers of contemporary music in Hong Kong and Seattle are Teresa Teng for the female vocalists and Sam Hul for the males. Both sing in Mandarin. On the other hand, the elderly Chinese like the classic Chinese opera music with the clanging cymbals and heart throbbing drum rolls. The tapes cost an average of $5 each.


For those who have just immigrated to the states, the Hong Kong contemporary music is important. Hui explained the enjoyment of the music by commenting, ""Before the transition period, they (Chinese immigrants) still hang on to things that are Chinese...the Chinese contemporary music is almost like American -- you mix Chinese words with contemporary music.""


One of the most popular items sold is the 25 cent Chinese newspaper. The seven different Chinese newspapers Hui sells are from Hong Kong originally but are printed in San Francisco. By the time the papers reach the stands in Seattle, the news is three days delayed. But this doesn't seem to bother the older people who are the key buyers of the newspapers.


""The older people from the old country buy the newspapers because it's part of their daily routine and also because they're interested in news of things back home,"" said Hui.


Some magazines also cover news but are usually more in depth. In addition to news magazines. Far Eastern Imports stocks a wide assortment of magazines which cover moviestars, singers, sports (especially soccer and kung fu) and travel. Most of the 35 different magazines are from Hong Kong and reflect the culture of Hong Kong.


Books and novels in Chinese are for everybody. The teenagers in particular, like the love stories. Regular frequenters are from the International District and Beacon Hill areas. Recently, Hui supplied books to a small town in Idaho which doesn't normally have access to Chinese reading material and then bought back the used books.


Hui commented that the summertime brings tourists from small towns around Seattle like Mount Vernon that don't have Chinese bookshops.


Like the bookshops in Hong Kong, customers are allowed to come in and hear free previews of the tapes before purchasing.

It's quite amazing to see how the history of this country seems to go in circles -- a swing to the left, a swing to the right. To observe the direction this country takes in its overall political philosophies is like watching a drunken driver trying to stay on the road.


Over three hundred years ago, the pilgrims (you know the folks that came to dinner with the Indians and didn't leave) left Europe to escape religious persecution. No one was going to tell how to worship God. Today, some of their descendants are rank and file followers of the so-called Moral Majority -- a group that preaches its own special political brand of religious persecution. You know it's ironic that a man named Church (the Idaho senator) was defeated because his political stand wasn't ""moral enough.""


Ten years ago, we had the new left. New political observers speak of the new right. So what is new about the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party, or even the John Birch society. American Nazi leaders made statements about North Carolina and South Carolina seceding from the U.S. (shades of civil war) to form all-white states. Hey, it may not be a bad idea to put all those bigots, race baiters, White Separatists, and other unmentionables in one place.


Ten years ago people were talking about the need to get out of Vietnam. Today, people talk about the need to get into Iran. Ten years ago, people burned Nixon in effigy. Today, people burn crosses on other people's lawns. Ten years ago, people worked hard to get civil rights laws passed. Today, people are working hard to get civil rights laws repealed. Ten years ago, hippies were the proponents of the counter-culture. Today, they are wearing polyester suits. Many who were anti-establishment back then are the establishment today.


Who would have thought that Eldridge Cleaver, the old Black Panther leader, Eugene McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society would endorse the same candidate (Reagan, of course for President? But then again, who would have thought, ten years ago, that Ronald Reagan would be elected. And it seems inconceivable that Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson is considered too ""liberal."" But he is one of the candidates singled out by the Moral Majority to defeat in 1982.


Fifty years ago, there was the great Depression. The private sector went belly up. The bread lines formed. As a consequence, the Roosevelt Administration made great strides in passing social welfare legislation. The government created jobs because the private sector could not provide jobs for everyone. Wow, today, the cycle is complete. The new president is advocating that the government get out of social welfare and job creation and have the private sector pick it up. The solution to this problem is like answering the question, ""What came first, the chicken or the egg?""


Over a hundred years ago the civil war was fought. Beside the issue of slavery, the war was fought over the question of state's rights. Then, we had a President (Lincoln) who talked about a union of states rights. Today, we have the same argument about states rights. But we have a President (Reagan) who is advocating for states rights.


It has been said that the difference between a liberal and conservative is that a liberal looks to the future and thinks in terms of what it could be and that a conservative looks to the past and thinks in terms of what it was. Well, if history does evolve in cycles, the past is our future and the future is our past.

Once a small, little-known French town, Bruyeres, became, as a result of World War II, a historical site some Japanese Americans never forgot. For Nisei (second generation Japanese) veterans from Seattle revisiting European battlegrounds, an October reunion at Bruyeres stirred bittersweet memories.


The 14 veterans, members of the 442nd Regimental Combat Unit, were accompanied on a 23-day European tour by wives and widows of veterans killed in the war. The 62 persons retraced the ground the 442nd covered in 20 months during 1944-45.


To get overseas in 1944, most Nisei crossed barbed wire fences surrounding internment camps where Japanese Americans were confined.


""They asked for volunteers,"" said Yoshito Mizuta, one of many who responded. ""We wanted to prove that we were American citizens.""


When the Selective Service in 1944 declared Japanese Americans eligible for military service, 19,000 men, volunteered. Officials had expected 1,500.


Mizuta left his family in an internment camp to join the ranks of the 442's 2nd battalion.


In October, 1944, the 442 answered a call to liberate a battalion of Texans, trapped behind German lines for seven days.


After heavy fighting and casualties, the battalion was freed, and Bruyeres, on the outskirts of the Vosges woods, was rid of German occupation.


In freeing 275 members of the lost battalion, more than 200 Japanese Americans were killed and more than 600 were wounded.


The 442, honored for bravery, became the most highly decorated unit in U.S. military history.


As word of the 442's heroism spread, a symbolic liberation occurred overseas. The 442 helped Japanese Americans in internment camps ""prove themselves"" loyal.


Wounded during the 442's ""Battle for the Lost Battalion"" at Bruyeres, Mizuta did not accompany the unit on later campaigns.


His first return to Europe, 36 years later, Mizuta said, ""made the whole European trip worthwhile.""


On a ""cold, dark night almost like it was 36 years ago when we first crept into the Vosges woods,"" Mizuta said, the veterans visited a 442 monument constructed by the Bruyeres townspeople and funded by the Japanese American Citizens' League.


During a ceremony at the monument, ""no one moved -- not a sound was uttered -- until the last flare burned out.""


""And I doubt that there were any dry eyes during the tribute,"" Mizuta said.


Mizuta recalled an excerpt from an account of the battle in the Bruyeres Town Hall:


""After the fierce Vosges action, the remnants of the 442nd stood at attention in formation. The general asked the 442's commanding officer. 'Where is your regiment?'


""The commanding officer replied, 'Sir, this is the regiment.""

""Sometimes I feel like dying"" and ""This place seemed more like home to me"" -- are feelings the Bush Hotel residents have about living at the Hotel and in the International District. Empathizing with their tenants, the hotel management staff operates under these guidelines: the Bush Hotel is the resident's home and everyone is an important person.


The Bush Hotel, on Maynard and Jackson streets, is being remodeled. Part of the Hotel will become a community center, and the top floors of the Hotel will still remain low-income housing.


The general make-up of the tenants -- their age, sex, and income -- is described by Assistant Manager Sharon Pierce, an employee for two years and a resident since August, 1980. She said the ages of the clientele ranges from six to 98 years. There are about 10 women living at the Hotel. The transient population is comprised mainly of single young men who stop off at the Bush before going on to the Alaskan canneries or who are between jobs. Some, finding jobs in Seattle or in the Hotel, stay on to become regular tenants. Most of the regular tenants are elderly, retired or disabled men, and represent many races: White, Asian, Native American, and Black. Most have no family or family ties. The average income of a regular tenant is $200-$300 a month. Ms. Pierce gave an example of the stringent income some tenants must live on. One tenant has his rent paid through the mail by one check and receives another $45 check which he must live on for the rest of the month.


Screen out troublemakers


Hotel Manager Eddie Allianic can relate to the tenants because he knows what it is like to be poor. A Filipino Chinese from Hawaii, he remarked: ""I myself came from a poor family of seven. Being plantation people, we were very poor -- but we were very happy people. I always got along without the luxuries of life.""


He has been the hotel manager for two years. ""I like the challenge of providing housing for the elderly -- it's personally satisfying,"" said Allianic.


When he first became the manager, he sensed the tenants' distrust and reluctance to accept a stranger. His first priority was to make friends with them. He also told his staff to develop a strong rapport with the tenants and to treat them well -- ""especially the older tenants."" He emphasized to his staff: ""We are all on the same level.""


Besides formal hotel duties, the staff takes checks to the bank, handles simple business transactions, provides weekly maid service and 24-hour desk service, and supplies a daily desk newspaper. Future plans, said Ms. Pierce, include sending out fire drill notices. ""We have tenants who can't walk or get around easy, and the staff should know who to get out first.""


The staff also screens out trouble-makers. Julia Larangang, Public Authority office manager, stated: ""The Bush used to have a reputation -- for whatever you want, you can get it at the Bush. But now we do our best to keep pushers and junkies out of the building. If someone is identified, we don't have to renew their rent."" Ms. Pierce said the staff basically knows who the street people are or the tenants do and will let them know.


Jose Delacruz, 98, the Bush's oldest resident, receives special care. Because he often forgets to take his required medication, the staff sets an alarm clock at the front desk to ring. When he is supposed to take it, they make sure he takes his pill.


Also, if the staff is worried about a tenant -- someone who might be ill or has not been seen that day -- they go to the room to check on him.


""Everyone is a VIP""


""This is his home,"" said Allianic. ""To make them feel good and loved, we give them Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners."" Ms. Pierce said: ""We save pop cans and newspapers to make money so we'll be able to fix them a hot meal on holidays. It's fun because most of the tenants don't have families, and it shows that someone cares and they're not forgotten."" The staff usually prepares the food at home and brings it to the hotel. A buffet is set up in the lobby for all to share.


Birthdays do not go unnoticed -- the staff gives regular tenants a fruit basket on their birthdays. At the Hilton, VIPs were given fruit baskets, explained Allianic, ""but here, everyone is a VIP so we give them fruit baskets on their birthdays. I make it up myself.""


A recipient of a fruit basket in March, Vi, 50, said: ""Eddie drops everything to see you. It's not easy to have access to a leading authority."" Vi likes living at the Bush. ""Everyone helps you if you need help and they leave you alone here are nice and don't bother me. There's no riff-raff.""


Allianic said, ""The people in the ID are not the bad kind of people (criminals, murders) and they are not rich."" The tenants feel comfortable among their own kind and the people who come here know that ""they share the same lifestyle."" He reflected, ""Most people come to live here because it is the Chinatown area and they (being of ethnic origin) are so well acclimated to this area.""


""No one cares""


""This place seemed more like home to me and my friends are here,"" explained Ms. Sambrano, who recently got married in the Bush Hotel lobby.


""I like living at the Bush because of the atmosphere -- the people are friendly and they help each other out. Her husband does not like some of the people he sees at the Bush -- drugusers, alcoholics, stragglers. But, he said, the good people are the majority. Sambrano said, ""I like living in China-town because I get along with old people and my experiences are similar."" If the neighborhood people are too rich or too different, ""they don't feel you should be there."" On the other hand, he said, ""If the people are too trashy -- you get clobbered.""


After leaving the Philipines in 1970 Sambrano lived in Hawaii. Because of language and social adjustment problems, he quit school after the ninth grade. He described his adolescence: ""In the Philippines, I was a good boy. I became a bad boy when I came here and learned no-no ways -- I got into trouble.""


After his Army discharge in 1980, he planned to work in the Alaskan canneries. ""Ten of us came here (the Bush) after we got out of the Army,"" said Sambrano, ""and I'm the only one that stayed here because I had a wisdom tooth problem."" Broke and suffering from a leg injury received in the Army, he ""didn't eat at first and then went on welfare for three months."" Sambrano held odd-jobs and played pool for a living. On a good day, he could earn $100 and on a bad day, he could lose it.


He met Ms. Sambrano at the Pike Place Market during his ""drifting days."" He said she has made him more steady, now he plans for the future: ""But right now, I feel like no one cares about me,"" he said, because he is tied up in bureaucratic red tape, trying to get military and government assistance. ""You have to have money so people know you -- money speaks,"" continued Sambrano. ""I want to go to school to get a job and I want my leg fixed. But if I go to school, I don't think we'll be living here -- we'll want a better place.""


""Reverse discrimination""


Experiencing ""reverse discrimination"", Mark Rowan, 35, a painter, stated: ""I was crossing the street and an oriental driver yelled, 'Hey White man, get out of the street.'"" He saw an Asian thief in an Asian store, and said it was difficult to communicate with the ""old lady and little kid"" who operated the store. By the time they understood him, he was further thwarted because ""they wouldn't believe me -- I was White and the thief was Asian.""


Originally from Maple Valley, Rowan worked in Alaska and came to Seattle to get medical treatment for his diabetes. He also has ""racing thoughts"" -- a mental problem causing him to think and react too fast to situations.


He came to Seattle and was placed at the Bush by welfare officials. ""This was the cheapest place to live on $280 a month plus food stamps and medical coupons,"" he explained. ""I ate a lot of sandwiches the last two weeks of every month, in order to make it. But since I only eat peanut butter sandwiches, it really threw my diet off because of the sugar.""


Living in the ID has been ""different"" said Rowan. ""Things that happen to me, you wouldn't think could happen to people. ""While handing a match to a guy, I accidentally dropped it -- he took a razor to me and the police had to come in.""


""Gambled and drank""


""I gambled and drank away all my money -- I used to drink all night and all afternoon, but not everyday,"" recalled Eddie Chow, 68, a former card dealer at gambling clubs in the ID and in Nevada.


Living on and off at the Bush since 1933, Chow now receives $350 a month from Supplemental Security income (SSI) and $80 ""cash food money"" -- money for people ""who can't cook.""


In the 1920s, he quit school after the third grade and became a shoe-shine boy. Throughout his teen years, he held various odd-jobs, eventually becoming a card dealer at gambling clubs in the ID and in Nevada. Chow came to Washington to get married because ""it was the only state in the 1930s that allowed mixed marriages and my wife was White."" Here, he met a big-time gambler who convinced him to stay and teach people how to gamble. He lived ""high"" -- expensive food, drink, clothes -- until finally, when he was 62, sick and broke, he settled down. Actually, he was forced to. Drinking aggravated his high blood pressure and arthritis and the police ""closed up the town to gambling.""


Chow commented on his present life: ""I don't like it but I got to take it. I'm not going to lie there I fight the arthritis. But sometimes I feel like dying. I got no enjoyment from living. You know you can't get well -- you suffer. I'm not afraid of dying. Old people don't have anything to do or to live for."" They just have a room -- no money, no work, no family.


Reflecting on a return to better days, Chow ruefully joked, ""If I got to feeling good like the old days, I might go crazy again and start drinking.""


Although Chow is no longer dependent upon alcohol, many other tenants are. Allianic said alcoholism is the largest problem among his tenants. Many have been thrown out of their families, rejected by society, and made to feel worthless. ""They come here and make friends,"" he said, ""because there is nowhere else to go. Here -- they are accepted.


""At one time, these alcoholics were very skilled workers -- plumbers and painters. We had an Alaskan Indian, in his 40's. He worked part-time in house-keeping. I noticed his alcohol problem. He worked hard but he'd go on binges. When he was sober and when he was drunk -- what a different person. I talked to him. The majority of alcoholics do not have the courage to take themselves to a treatment place, but this man did."" After his treatment he told Allianic that he was cured and promised to check in periodically with the treatment place, and asked to come back to the hotel. He is currently working at the hotel.


""Daddy, you're drunk""


""I don't know what it is but something tells me I have to go out to get my drink,"" soft-spoken Ajabido D. Adialin, 67, said.


He drinks two glasses of straight bourbon before every meal. He cooks his meal in his room, goes out for his drinks, returns and eats his meal, and goes to sleep. He does this at 6 a.m., 11 a.m., and 7 p.m. By pre-cooking his meal, Adialin said he does not have to worry about being too drunk to cook. He does not buy a bottle, even though it would be cheaper, because he knows he will drink it up. Buying his drinks by the glass, he knows he can control his intake. He gets around in the ID, using a cane and sometimes a walker. ""With the walker, if I get drunk, I don't have to worry about falling or walking,"" he said.


""I don't know how it started,"" said Adialin bewildered, a small and frail man with a quiet dignity. ""Maybe it started in Guam, during my middle years, when I was widowed during World War II."" He started to drink, ""not a lot, just steady."" After the war, he came home and sent his two children back to the Philippines. He knew he could not take care of them, and remembers his two-year-old girl telling him, ""Daddy, you're drunk.""


In 1956, he had his first epileptic seizure. He was told it was heredity and that he could never get rid of the disease, only ""hope to control it."" This caused him to drink more heavily: ""I like to forget it because I'm scared. I don't know where or when it will happen. I feel helpless.""


A former seaman, Adialin is retired and disabled, living on SSI. The 10-year resident intends to continue his drinking pattern, despite his doctor's warnings, because, he said: ""I'm old already. This is part of my life now. It's like I'm married to the drink. But when I go, it will go with me.""


""Totally broke""


""The people are friendly, they're not out to rip you off,"" commented Lynn Adams, 35, a transient resident from California. ""There's a different feeling here in Seattle and the ID. It's a large city but it still has a small-town feeling."" She said she and her boyfriend. Chris Mattioli, 29, hope to become regular tenants, not only because the rent will be cheaper, but also because they like the Bush Hotel and the ID.


Transients often come to the hotels and stay on, becoming regular tenants Allianic said the staff helps out needy transients.


Describing their first day here Ms. Adams stated: ""We didn't even have 15 cents for a telephone call. We were totally broke. We had enough to pay one week's rent. I've never been in that position before. It really bothered me -- being in a new area and not knowing anybody.""


On their way to Alaska from California, they were forced to stop in Seattle last month because of car trouble. Since Mattioli had lived and worked in the ID about three or four years ago, he knew the Bush was a clean and cheap place to stay.


The staff helped out the young couple as it has helped out many others at the Hotel. If someone cannot pay their rent or has an accident, Allianic said. ""Management tries to help them out."" Given jobs in the Hotel, Mattioli helps do construction work and gardening and Ms. Adams preps the floors and lays tiles.

Self-directed job search training programs are providing individuals with information and training to assist them in finding employment.


Michael Flor, program management specialist for the Private Industry Council (PIC), explained that many former employees under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) are effectively utilizing the self-directed job search method to find jobs in the private sector. PIC -- which utilizes the energies of prominent business persons, community leaders, educators and organized labor -- seryes as a link between the business community, the local CETA system and organized labor.


PIC has been utilizing the self-directed job search method to increase private sector employment opportunities for the economically disadvantaged, sponsoring a four-week program that ""teaches the art of finding a job,"" according to Flor. ""The philosophy behind the self-directed method,"" Flor said, ""is that in meeting an employer, the image you first project is the longest lasting impression. So prospective employees need to be trained in their approach, basics such as resume preparation and interview skills. The self-directed method will teach you the skills you need in acquiring a job.""


Flor explained that the program has had great success in assisting persons in finding jobs. He added that, in the CETA system, the self-directed job search is one of the least expensive programs as far as cost per placement.


The self-directed method is essentially, a self-help activity in which participants assume primary responsibility for their employment status. Participants initiate their own job search, aided by appropriate information, encouragement, discipline and support from a trained staff.


Flor pointed out that the four-week program consists of two weeks in the classroom, and two weeks of actual job search. During the job search, Flor said. the job seeker spends time in a room with phone banks, utilizing a script, with the goal of acquiring an interview with an employer. ""A support mechanism develops among the people in the room,"" Flor said. ""There's a lot of sharing in the phone rooms and a lot of give and take; with positive criticism going around.""


The goal behind the self-directed method is to develop an attitude which creates opportunity for sustained, productive employment. It is also said that, on the average, members of a self-directed job search program will find an unsubsidized job in less time than persons who employ more traditional means of locating employment.

Several International District agencies, attempting to prevent the ouster of long term residents from the American Hotel, have appealed a City department's ruling which clears the way for conversion of the building into an emergency shelter for women and children.


The Department of Construction and Land Use (DCLU), which decides the classification of building uses under the Zoning Code, says the intended use of the building by the new owners, the Union Gospel Mission, is that of a hotel.


As a result of this decision, the Mission's plans do not constitute a change of use under the Zoning Code. The recorded use of the building before being purchased by the Mission was also that of a hotel.


Most single room occupancy buildings are classified as ""hotels"" by DCLU. William Justen, Director of DCLU, told the International District groups ""hotels are not residential.""


ID advocates say the American Hotel could lose residential units because DCLU is not looking at the actual use of the building. Eighty-five to 90 percent of the building's tenants are permanent residents; many have lived there between 10 to 20 years. The building has not been used as a transient facility for years.


The DCLU interpretation would affect other buildings in the International District and downtown neighborhoods. ""Much of the affordable rental housing in the city is now located in older downtown buildings,"" stated John V. Fox of the Seattle Displacement Coalition in a letter to DCLU, ""Some of those buildings are called hotels, but in reality, they have provided permanent residency for long term elderly residents."" Large developers attempt to replace existing low cost housing with office, parking and/or condominiums, proving buildings provide temporary rather than permanent residencies. They are then able to avoid relocation requirements and fee payments, he stated.


If a change of use was ruled, the Mission would have been required to pay expensive relocation fees for displaced residents under the Housing Preservation Ordinance (HPO).


""The American Hotel has been used as a primary residence of its occupants,"" said Katy Chaney, Director for Housing and Zoning Enforcement with DCLU, in a letter to the Mission, ""We would define its use under the HPO as ""residential"".


The groups involved in the appeal, the International District Economic Association. International District Housing Alliance, Inter*Im, and some American Hotel residents, agree that emergency housing is necessary, but the Union Gospel Mission should look at vacant or non-residential buildings.


Efforts have been made to find other possible sites for their shelter. Uwajimaya has made three different purchase and exchange offers for other buildings with Reverend Steve Burger, Director of the Mission. All were turned down.


In June 1981, the most recent offer was made by Uwajimaya: $420,000 cash for the property. No response has yet been made.


A final ruling by the Hearing Examiner to determine if a change of use has occurred is expected by the end of the month. The losing party will then have a chance to appeal in a higher court.

The Republican controlled House Committee on Redistricting of the Washington State Legislature passed a bill to redistrict the state's congressional districts.


The bill, called Plan No. 9, would change the seventh Congressional District to encompass the southern half of Seattle, Mercer Island, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Bothell and Woodinville. The plan would also place Tacoma in a district that stretches south to include Vancouver. Wash. The bill died during the special session of the Legislature, but may be acted upon when the Legislature convenes for its regular session.


The Seventh District presently encompasses the southern half of Seattle and parts of Capitol Hill and the central area and Burien, Renton, Mercer Island, and part of Bellevue. The Seventh District is presently represented by Democrat Mike Lowry. Plan No. 9 would strongly favor Republican candidates. Voters in the suburban areas of the proposed district voted overwhelmingly for Ronald Reagan and Slade Gorton in the 1980 elections.


Plan No. 9 and Plans 1 and 10 were the subject of a public hearing in Olympia in early November. Republicans unveiled the three plans only minutes before the beginning of the hearing. The Republicans chose the three from over a dozen plans secretly prepared by the Republican staff. Democratic legislators on the committee complained about the lack of an opportunity to study the plans to have any role in the formation of the plans. The maps unveiled for public testimony were so small that it was not precisely clear which parts of the Puget Sound area were included in which district.


Under Plan No. 10, the Seventh District would include all of Seattle, except the very northern end, Tukwila, and parts of Renton and Burien. Mercer Island, where Lowry lives, would be placed into the Eighth Congressional District, comprised of strong Republican suburban and rural areas.


Among the persons testifying at the hearing was Gary Locke, attorney and president of Asian Americans for Political Action (AAPA). Locke testified in favor of Plan 10 as being the best of the three plans for preserving the voting interests of Asians and minorities. Locke said that under constitutional requirements, communities of interest must be preserved in any redistricting plan. The interests of inner-city Asians and minorities may not be diluted by placing those voters in a district of predominately suburban and lrural voters.


Locke said Plans No. 1 and 9 would dilute the voting interests of Asians and minorities. He told the committee that Asians and minorities live predominately in Seattle. Their concerns and socio-economic interests differ from those of the typical suburban and rural voter, he said. Locke said Asians and minorities do not want to compete among suburban and rural voters for the attention of their congressional representative.


Asked how he felt that Lowry would be living outside the Seventh District under Plan 10, Locke said whether Lowry remained the representative from the Seventh District was not the issue because AAPA is non-partisan. The issue, he said, was whether inner-city Asians and minorities are in a district comprised of voters with similar interests and concerns.


Also testifying in favor of plan 10 were Constance Rice for the King County Democrats and Lem Howell for Congressman Mike Lowry.

Recently, Seattle witnessed a rare performance of shakuhachi music at the Nippon Kan Theatre by Takeo Yamashiro. A young player at 38, Takeo demonstrated an impressive musicianship and a spirit and presence seldom seen in any musician.


Takeo has played Shakuhachi for 20 years. After ten years of traditional study in Japan, he dropped out to pursue a secular lifestyle that included a family and career, while continuing shakuhachi practice and sitting on his own. The roles and responsibilities of his life seem incongruous with his independent, free-thinking philosophy. Yet, there is no doubt that he has reached a high artistic and spiritual level; his performance was one of the best I have seen of any kind.


""When I lived in the temple, I would often attend Buddhist ceremonies with my teacher, and we would play a kind of background music. My teacher played a long bass shakuhachi, and I would play high, flowing melodies on top. The atmosphere of the ceremony was there; we played along with that. It required control of breath, mind and body.""


Takeo studied shakuhachi in the Tozan school for seven years in Japan, then switched to the Kikusui dojo for three. The last two of these he served as uchi deshi, which is a live-in apprentice, in the temple, assisting the master 24 hours a day and teaching students. He then left Japan with a one year leave of absence and didn't return.


After ten years of studying within the traditional system, Takeo became disenchanted with the rigid, often abused structure. Shakuhachi students must progress in steps, studying initially with an uchi deshi, then later with a master. Along the way, the student must pay each teacher a certain fee, regardless of the student's financial situation. Because of this and other arbitrary practices, Takeo considers this educational system to be unfair and unrecognizant of students' abilities and talents.


""I don't request a fee from students who cannot pay. The door is open for those who can't afford but who have great patience and a desire to play.


""Also, I wouldn't call these formal lessons. In Japan, the student must bow to the teacher and sit sanzen; this is very difficult for some people. There are many rules that are merely arbitrary and have nothing to do with learning. The teacher should be one who is there to give advice and help when it is needed, but not just to tell the student what to do.""


Although Takeo has no formal training Buddhism, he has been sitting on his own for many years. To Takeo, sitting, blowing and playing are all the same.


""It all depends on your state of mind. My mind is in the same state whether I am sitting or playing shakuhachi. It is the same with performance. Each performance is different, depending on how the audience feels, what I feel from them, and my own state of mind.""


As a performer, Takeo also does not distinguish between performing solo shakuhachi music or with samisen and koto.


""The structure of the music is different. When playing the music with samisen and koto, the structure is set: the phrases are all the same, and you play within them. But with shokyoku (solo shakuhachi music), the important thing is the breath. You can make your own phrases, depending on your state of mind and the breath. When my mind is there, playing to the shape of the phrases, I just do it. It doesn't matter if there are accompanists.""


Takeo is married and has three children. He has been a community worker serving Issei senior citizens in Vancouver, B.C., for 7 1/2 years. Although he does not perform extensively with other musicians or record, he performs a solo concert once or twice a year, ""to which I put all my energy. If I can do this. I am satisfied.


""Sometimes work and family life are frustrating and tough, but when I think of what else I could be doing, it is not so bad.""

The winner of the primary election in the County's Fifth District. Ruby Chow, will no doubt continue her winning streak in the general election Nov. 3.


Should we assume that she can now adopt a passive role on issues affecting us here in the International District, or should we demand proper attention?


Those of you who voted her in should certainly be able to influence some of her decisions. Maybe I can offer some hints for you followers and Ms. Chow to consider.


Ms. Chow is a member of the Metro Council, with voting privileges and the opportunity to provide input on important decisions affecting the future of her district, especially the I.D.


An example of an extremely important issue in which the I.D. needed a vocal advocate on the Metro Council was the planning by the Port of Seattle to convert Union Station into a Multi Model Transportation Center. This Center, if constructed, would have housed Greyhound. Continental, Trailways, Western Tours, Grey Line Tours. Amtrak and Metro! The environmental impacts of this Regional Transportation Center would have spelled the end of the I.D. as a residential neighborhood and it is doubtful whether the existing commercial shops, stores and restaurants could have survived.


Our representative on the Metro Council did not alert our community of the impending danger of this development when it was first planned by the Port in 1974 and again in 1978. But that's all water under the bridge, or is it?


Even now, Metro is studying Union Station as part of a plan for Metro Transition. This planning started over two years ago and we still get absolutely no word from our Metro Council representative on the positive or negative aspects of such development. I agree that the issues may be confusing, but the I.D. does have representation on the citizens committee for the downtown plan; they include Ben Woo, Glenn Chinn and myself, and I'm sure any or all of us would be happy to share our knowledge and expertise with our Council representative.


Another important issue that could dictate the future of the I.D. is the impending Downtown Plan for Seattle. Several years ago Ms. Chow also organized her supporters to oppose the I.D. Special Review District Board.


The I.D. Special Review District was established to protect the District from development that would be contrary to the goals and desires of the I.D. community. The I.D. Special Review District Board allows this community to make decisions about changes of use, new development, and aesthetic design. The I.D. community has established small business and residential uses as priorities. The Board is one way to insure that these priorities are carried through. We must be on our guard against speculators, who are concerned about large profits to be made from large-scale commercial ventures.


The community must encourage the City, County via Ms. Chow and other policy makers to allow the I.D. Special Review Board to continue to function as the I.D. community-based land use decision-making body. We must do this for the future of the District. I believe Ms. Chow should work with I.D. - Chinatown representatives in a positive way and now just involve herself at ribboncutting ceremonies, taking credit for things she has had little to do with.

After more than two years of research and preparation, the Chinese Cultural Foundation (CCF) of San Francisco opened the Chinese of America 1785-1980 exhibition. Using pictures and artifacts, the exhibit chronicles the history, of Chinese in American society, a story that spans two centuries but is rarely, if ever, told in our history books.


Since the exhibit first opened in October, some 12,000 visitors have come through its doors according to a CCF spokesperson. From San Francisco, it will travel to St. Louis, Minneapolis, Chicago, Boston and Honolulu. To date, no commitment has been made to bring the exhibit to Seattle.


The exhibit opens with the quotation. ""These states are . . . not a nation but a teeming nation of nations,"" recognizing that America's history is built upon the contribution of its immigrant population. But the walk through the Chinese people's history in America shows that their contribution has been colored by hardship, racism and discrimination.


A number of Chinese were first lured to the West by the discovery of gold. But it was the great need for labor abroad and the economic problems at home that caused 2.5 million people to leave China between 1840 and 1900. Some 322,000 came to the U.S. between 1850 and 1882.


This emigration period to the U.S. also saw increasing racism and paranoia over Chinese competition for jobs. Racism became institutionalized through immigration laws and segregation policies to restrict Chinese participation and profit in American society.


Emigration of Chinese merchants and political refugees to the U.S. began prior to 1785. The difference was that now the bulk of emigrants were peasants who could not pay for their trip abroad. This opened the way for the ""coolie trade,"" a middleman system which helped facilitate the immigrants' passage to the new land. Passage money was advanced to the emigrant who repaid the debt after arrival in the new country, or the emigrant signed term contracts of service in the foreign land in return for the trip over.


This system promoted abuses. Some were tricked or forced into going abroad. Cantonese called it ""maaijeutzai,"" which meant ""the selling of pigs."" Brutal treatment and unsanitary conditions aboard the passage ships frequently led to illness and death.


Once in the U.S., many of the early emigrants established themselves in the mining regions of California. During this period, racist and nativistic feelings were common among American miners. Many felt that foreigners, especially nonwhites, had no right to the gold. Even before the Chinese arrived in large numbers, American miners tried to force Mexican, South American, Hawaiian and American Indians out of the mining field.


When the Chinese became more visible, it was their turn to be the target for the miners' hostility. There were organized moves to expel them from a number of camps. In others, the Chinese were limited to working lean or abandoned claims.


In 1882, American miners forced the California state legislature to levy a Foreign Miner's Tax aimed primarily at the Chinese. From 1852-1870 this tax brought in $5 million, representing half of the state's revenue during this period.


By the 1860s the West, especially California, was ripe for development and the large scale exploitation of the country's natural resources. The need for a cheap, reliable labor supply was necessary for progress. The source of labor -- the Chinese immigrants.


As almost all the Chinese immigrants were male, they represented more than 20 percent of the total physical labor force even though they represented about 10 percent of California's population. Chinese labor was demanded in those jobs requiring physical labor and in work requiring skills that could be learned in a very short time. As long as California needed a large labor pool, opposition to the Chinese immigrants was relatively low.


Chinese labor was used to cut into the hills and fill in the bay for wharves and depots on San Francisco's waterfront. Their labor was also used in the canneries, farms, lumber camps, mines, fisheries, and for excavating wine storage tunnels in California's wine country, and building and maintaining roads.


However, the most notable contribution of the Chinese was in building the railroads which linked the Eastern states with the developing West. Chinese labor was recruited from the mining camps and later directly from China.


The Chinese built the Central Pacific line which started in California and ended in Omaha, Nebraska. At the same time, Irish laborers were laying track in the East that would eventually meet the Chinese-constructed railroad in Omaha. When the last spike was driven in, a celebration took place. However, a photograph of the celebration shows no Chinese participants. A CCF spokesperson states, ""One theory for this is that railroad companies and white laborers did not want to recognize the contribution of the Chinese; thus, they were purposely excluded from the celebration and official photographs.""


The building of the railroads led to the dispersion of Chinese throughout the West. Many settled in towns along the railroad routes after construction was completed. Others went east to begin Chinatowns in the Midwest and East. The railroad also facilitated the movement of Chinese laborers to plantations along the lower Mississippi River to replace liberated black slaves. However, in spite of their migration, the West, particularly California, still remained the stronghold for Chinese labor activities.


Chinese labor played an important role in the development of the West. However, in the 1870s when the stock market crashed and economic hard times hit, the Chinese were accused of taking the jobs of white laborers. The Chinese at the time were a small, voteless minority who became easily identifiable scapegoats and were blamed for the country's economic problems.


Labor union leaders, local newspapers, opportunistic politicians and an angry public directed their frustrations at the Chinese. Anti-Chinese feelings intensified until in 1882. Congress passed legislation barring further immigration of Chinese laborers. Only officials, teachers, students, merchants and travelers were allowed entry.


Passage of the Exclusion Act of 1882 and subsequent amendments barred the immigration of Chinese laborers for the next 60 years.


The passage of the 1882 Act actually agitated anti-Chinese sentiment. Outbreaks of violence occurred in many areas of the West. The most serious of these occurred at Rock Springs, Wyoming (1885) where 28 Chinese were killed and 15 were wounded when a mob invaded its Chinatown. Chinese were expelled from some areas (including Tacoma, Washington), tormented and harassed in others. As a result, many Chinese left the rural areas for the safety of the cities where Chinatowns granted them a degree of protection. Others migrated to the Midwest and East or left for Hawaii, but anti-Chinese sentiments existed almost everywhere they went.


Exclusion laws barred alien Chinese from becoming American citizens, but even Chinese American citizens were not better off. Discrimination existed everywhere: in schools, theatres, barbershops, housing, etc. Undoubtedly, these conditions further alienated Chinese from the mainstream society.


The Chinese did not accept the exclusion laws without protest, even though they had very few means with which to defend themselves. Their homeland was too weak to intercede effectively on their behalf. Along with their few supporters, they resorted to the courts and succeeded in winning a number of cases that would help stem the adverse tide.


Chinatown leaders approached authorities for more equitable treatment. The Chinese in America requested their countrymen in the homeland to force the U.S. to improve treatment of Chinese immigrants. In 1905, Chinese in China and in some overseas countries staged boycotts of American goods. These protests brought some improvement in the treatment of Chinese arrivals, but the exclusion laws remained in effect.


Despite the hostile treatment in America, some Chinese still preferred emigration to staying in China which was still beset with economic and political unrest. Many tried illegal means of entry. Some jumped ships at seaports or were smuggled in via Mexico, Canada and the West Indies. Others entered as ""paper sons"" claiming falsely that they were off-springs of U.S. citizens.


Attempting to halt these illegal entries, immigration officials and entry ports held Chinese immigrants for long, detailed interrogations. From 1910 to 1940 over 175,000 Chinese immigrants were processed at Angel Island in San Francisco Bay.


The stringent enforcement of the immigration laws sometimes put the U.S. in a compromising position. When the U.S. Navy fought in the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898, several dozen Chinese were recruited to fight. However, these same men were later denied entry into this country.


The economic status of Chinese Americans during the 61 years of exclusion was characterized by slow advances in the face of persistent discrimination. For many Chinese Americans, this period was one of very restricted opportunities. Even as late as 1930, two-thirds of all Chinese workers were still in service occupations such as domestic, laundry or restaurant workers.


As a more educated generation developed, a few Chinese broke out of the confines of the service trades. However, they still found it difficult to find meaningful work commensurate with their education.


When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. was brought into World War II as an ally of China and Western Europe. The second world war was a pivotal point for the Chinese in their participation in American society. The wartime manpower shortage opened doors to job opportunities which, up to this time, had been closed to Chinese. An estimated 12,000 served in the U.S. armed forces and thousands more men and women worked in the nation's war industries.


The war was also a major factor in eliminating the Chinese exclusion acts. In 1943, President Roosevelt signed the Magnuson Bill repealing the exclusion laws. This lifted the 61 years of restrictive immigration and permitted Chinese to become naturalized citizens. These events did not end discrimination or segregationist attitudes toward the Chinese but did help open up arenas of participation in American society. As the CCF spokesperson summed up. ""It is important to be an American in American society, but it is just as important to be Chinese and to remember our heritage and how our history in America has shaped our present.""

The testimony of a mystery witness, who said he saw Jimmy Bulosan Ramil and Pompeyo Benito Guloy, Jr. leave the scene of the shooting deaths of two local cannery union officials, closed the prosecution's case in a trial which has exposed an illegal gambling network and established a murder conspiracy.


Ramil and Guloy are charged with the June 1 shooting deaths of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, officials of Local 37, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, the Seattle-based cannery union.


Over 40 witnesses have testified for the prosecution as the trial heads into its fifth week.


Jaime Malabo, an 18-year-old high school student, was the only prosecution witness to testify that he actually saw both Ramil and Guloy at the murder scene. Malabo said he knew the two men through the union and other places in the community and that there was no question about the identity of the two persons he saw.


In her opening statements, King County Prosecuting Attorney Joanne Maida said that Ramil and Guloy did not act alone, but on the orders of others in killing Domingo and Viernes.


In the first weeks of testimony, the prosecution established the existence of an illegal high stakes gambling operation in Alaska's canneries and in Seattle's International District, charging that some of the active participants were union officials, gangsters and cannery foremen. The prosecution also established through testimony that there was a conspiracy to murder Domingo and Viernes because they had posed a threat to the survival of the gambling operation, implicating an alleged gang leader, Tony Dictado and ILWU Local 37 president Tony Baruso. The prosecution closed its case with Malabo's positive identification of Ramil and Guloy and testimony that Silme Domingo named his assailants three different times immediately after the shootings.


Robert San Pablo, the foreman at the Dillingham cannery in Alaska, was a key prosecution witness who told of illegal gambling in Alaska and the involvement of a gang known as the Tulisan, a Filipino word for bandits, in the gambling and the murders.


High stake gambling in Alaska, San Pablo testified, occurs during the salmon canning season with stakes as high as $1,000. These games were conducted in Seattle's International District during the off-seasons at the 514 Club and the ""609"", both located on S. King St. The Tulisan, with Tony Dictado alleged to be the leader, are the gambling operators, dealers, ""runners,"" enforcers, and collectors. They represent the ""muscle"" and security behind the gambling operations, the prosecution charged. and the gambling interests are represented by the cannery foremen or those close to them.


The foremen traditionally operate the gambling houses and a certain percentage of the ""cut"" automatically goes to them. The foremen's direct or indirect involvement in the gambling is crucial, the prosecution alleged, because they determine the composition of the cannery crews.


On May 26, five days before the shootings, San Pablo testified, Dictado had an argument with Viernes, the Union's dispatcher, over the new dispatching procedures which prevented Dictado's gang members from going to Alaska. Dictado had threatened Viernes in San Pablo's presence, swearing, ""Mother, I'm going to get rid of you,"" in Illocano, a Filipino dialect Viernes did not understand.


Union reformers Terri Mast, Angel Doniago, John Foz, Lynn Domingo and Glenn Suson had earlier testified that the reform movement, spearheaded by Domingo and Viernes, was a threat to the gambling operations in Alaska.


Recent dispatching reforms, instituted by Viernes, meant that workers who had been to the same cannery the year before were given first preference, those who had been to another cannery the year before were second preference, and anyone else fell in the third preference category. Dictado and his members fell into the third preference category and were not likely to be dispatched this year, union reform witnesses testified.


The day before the killings, San Pablo continued, Ramil told him in front of the Hong Kong Restaurant in the International District that Dictado ""is going to kill Gene tomorrow."" San Pablo left for Alaska on the day of the shootings, While in Alaska. San Pablo continued, he received a letter from Dictado demanding ""his share of the gambling money. San Pablo explained that, in the Alaska gambling operations, the foremen usually get 10 percent of the pot. Dictado wanted half of that from him, he said, although San Pablo testified that he was not involved in gambling this year.


Dictado called to the stand by the prosecution admitted he was a Tulisan member since 1978 and named three others as part of the gang: Danny Lorencio. Boy Peli Boyse Campo. Dictado said the Tulisan members were ""just close friends."" He denied that Ramil and Guloy were members and also denied that the Tulisan is involved in any illegal gambling operations Dictado however, was arrested shortly afterward and charged with the murder of Domingo and Viernes. He will be tried separately later.


San Pablo also testified that he received a letter from Local 37 President Tony Baruso after the shootings, requesting the rest of the ""gift"" from San Pablo for his assistance in getting San Pablo his present foreman job in Dillingham, Alaska, Baruso, who was earlier arrested (but not charged) because a gun registered in his name was determined to be the murder weapon took the stand and invoked the Fifth Amendment to most of the questions asked by prosecution and defense attorneys.


The prosecution also called police detectives and passers-by during the shooting to establish the scene of the crime. Several witnesses identified a black Trans Am with an eagle on the front hood during the day of the shootings. Dictado had such a car.


Maida then called upon firemen who testified about statements made by Domingo after he was shot. They testified that, while Domingo was suffering serious internal bleeding, he was alert and oriented, The firemen testified that Domingo named his assailants three times. After the third time, one fireman wrote the names phonetically on a scrap of paper spelling them ""Ben Galloy"" and ""Jimmy Ramml.""


Defense attorneys are expected to begin presentation of their case when Malabo leaves the witness stand. The trial is expected to continue one more week before the jury begins deliberation.

Warabi linked to cancer


With the fern season approaching in the mountains of the United States and with multitudes of people about to commune with nature after winter, warning should be made available against eating bracken fern or Warabi, as it is known to the Japanese. The warning should be directed at counteracting the encouragement to eat bracken fern that appears in such publications as the Time-Life books as well as several nature cookbooks, which identify the fern as the culinary fern in many recipes.


According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the bracken fern's carcinogenicity for man and animals has been debated since 1952 in some 50 articles in the scientific journals of seven countries. Cooking and eating the fiddlehead-shaped fronds has been suggested as partly responsible for the high incidence of stomach cancer in Japan. Experiments with rats, who were fed the fern, developed intestinal and urinary bladder cancer. Fresh as well as cooked and canned bracken are all implicated in cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and the bladder of man and of animals foraging on the fern.


Private funding conference scheduled


All International District agencies are qualified to attend a funding conference, ""Private Sector Funding For Programs Serving Women and Girls,"" on March 21, at the Bellevue Community College Theatre.


Representatives from Rainier National Bank, Pacific National Bank of Washington, Safeco Insurance, Weyerhaeuser Company Foundation, Wyman Youth Trust Fund, Medina Foundation, Bullitt Foundation, The Seattle Foundation, Washington Commission for the Humanities and others will be participating in panel discussions.


Mini-workshops will cover proposal writing, budgeting, finding and researching funding sources, and planning projects.


For information and registration, call Maryann at the Women's Center, Bellevue Community College, 641-2279.


Cultural and community center being established


You can help to ""Keep the Japanese American Experience Alive for Generations to Come"" by becoming a founding member of the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center in Los Angeles, CA. Of the three-building complex that will form the JACCC, the Center Building has been completed and is already the hub of activities to keep the Japanese heritage alive. Katsuma Mukaeda, JACCC chairman of the Board, and George J. Doizaki, JACCC president, stated in a letter. ""We (JACCC) are on the way to realizing the 'impossible dream' of our Issei pioneers by establishing this magnificent cultural center in Southern California.""


JACCC says the effort has begun and the first challenge to the community is to retire the $2 million mortgage on the Center Building. The community Redevelopment Agency has challenged JACCC to raise $1.5 million by proposing to grant $500,000 toward retiring the debt.


For anyone who is interested, checks can be made payable to JACCC and gifts are tax deductible. The address is Japanese American Cultural & Community Center, 244 S. San Pedro St., Los Angeles, CA 90012. The phone number is (213) 62-JACCC. You might request information on contributing as JACCC has an info package and a form which asks if you wish to be billed annually or twice a year, how you want your name to appear in the Founders' Booklet, etc. It may be something to look into.

This column has been developed as an ongoing project of the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus which meets the second Tuesday of every month at 6:30 p.m. in the Bush Community Center. All interested persons are invited to attend. For more information please call Sally Kazama (evenings) 722-4361.


A couple of years ago I suggested to Karen Denard who was then host of a weekly radio show on KING, that she make the refugee issue the focus of one of her programs. She did and I was one of the guests.


We talked about the cultural barrier facing refugees and the difficulties of obtaining a job in a totally new culture. We talked about the adaptability of refugees and their eager interest in learning English so that they could become self-sufficient. We discussed how the welfare system makes them feel shame, but that they had to rely on it to survive and feed their families. After our refugee discussion, we waited for calls and questions.


A burst of angry and spiteful people called to air their views about the mass of foreigners coming taking their jobs, and getting handouts. And they were quite articulate about their rage -- a rage born of misconceptions and misplaced frustrations.


High unemployment rates account for much of the resentment aimed at refugees. The frustration turns into anger. Anger directed toward a group with no real political clout, no actual power.


Never mind that the refugees take mostly blue collar jobs, primarily in the restaurant business and food processing industry. Never mind that; under the Refugee Act of 1980, the American government promised three years of support for them. With each editorial on refugees in the Seattle Post Intelligencer or the Seattle Times, with every article about the federal government threatening to cut off aid to refugees and citing the U.S.'s moral responsibility, the hate mail surfaces and the outpouring of anger increases.


The Reagan Administration, reneging on its commitment to provide refugees three years of welfare support, claims that its action will result in greater cost efficiency and put the refugees on an equal footing with the rest of the poor in this country.


However, as an editorial in the Seattle Post Intelligencer on March 18, 1982 stated. The catch here is that the biggest category of welfare. Aid to Families with Dependent Children, is limited to single-parent families. If Dad's around as he is in most refugee households -- the government won't pay.


Washington State has the third largest refugee population in the nation. There are 31,000 Southeast Asians here. What, will the refugees do without these funds? The unemployment rate here is over 12 percent. When thousands of English-speaking, trained and educated workers can't find jobs, there's little chance that untrained Indochinese hampered by language and cultural barriers can.


It should be noted that not everyone who called vented anti-refugee opinions. A few callers indicated sympathy toward a group of people whose culture and country had been ravaged; a few were aware that, to survive, many Indochinese had to leave their own countries.

""Hiroshima,"" the ""atomic kids,"" got together as a band about 10 years ago in Los Angeles during the days of protests, social consciousness, long hair, and Gidra newspaper. They ""paid their dues"" back then, playing community functions for free, then performing at college campuses and clubs for pay. Five years ago, they played every Tuesday and Thursday night at the ""Baby Lion;"" a small nightspot on Vermont and Washington -- the worst area in L.A. -- doing Top 40 for people's dancing pleasure.


Then the long-awaited prize -- their first album -- was released at the end of 1979. The Asian American ""fusion"" group's initial recording, incorporating traditional Japanese instruments and sounds, climbed the pop, rhythm & blues, and jazz charts simultaneously. In Seattle around that time, there weren't too many Asian Americans running around without either the record spinning on stereos, or a cassette version pumping out ""Taiko Song"" or ""Holiday"" in their cars.


The word went out this summer: Hiroshima would make their second appear . . . in Seattle as the last act in the Bumbershoot Festival. A Hiroshima concert in the Coliseum on Labor Day night was ""where it's at.""


Photographer Dean Wong and I sat in the Seattle Center press office the evening of the Hiroshima concert. Calls went back and forth between a Center PR person and the management of Hiroshima at 8:00. They were on at 9:20. We were granted 20 minutes for an interview with the band. The PR lady hustled us over to a backstage entrance at the Coliseum. Most of the Asian kids we saw milling about the grounds of the Center were probably there to catch Hiroshima.


A stage hand brought us to a stark concrete dressing room. The band was gone for a sound check on the Coliseum stage. Japanese hopi coats and white jump suits hung on the walls and wood folding tables were covered with open instrument cases and styrofoam boxes containing half-eaten dinners. After a few minutes, the male members of the group walked in. The sound check hadn't gone well; there were still audio problems that had to be ""winged"" while the concert was in progress.


But Hiroshima had bigger problems to contend with.


Larkin Arnold, executive vice-president of Arista Records in 1979, originally signed Hiroshima to that label. He was recognized by the recording industry as a genius at creating new directions for black music. Arnold has recently been succeeded by Clive Davis, a former president of Columbia Records. Davis personally tried to manage Hiroshima's career, hoping to turn them into a group that produced hit R&B singles.


""All music that is neither pop or rock is generally considered black music,"" Dan Kuramoto, leader and reedman for the band, said. ""It's inescapable that we're considered a black music act, and our audience is predominantly a black audience, and they've been good to us.


""But we don't want to be labeled anything except music,"" he continued. ""Clive Davis just didn't envision us the way we envisioned ourselves. So, rather than sound like Rick James, we and Arista Records had a parting of ways.""


Hiroshima is currently hoping to sign with CBS records, but is technically still under contract with Arista and their selling price is too high.


""To say that we are in-between labels right now is the politest way to put it,"" Kuramoto added.


Meanwhile, material Hiroshima worked on a year ago for a third album is still stuck in studio tapes.


The members of Hiroshima feel that what finally gets recorded on an album is sometimes not exactly the way they would like it. ""We lose something in the studio because we're not experienced studio musicians and writers and/or arrangers,"" Kuramoto said. ""We don't know how to translate our music that well into the studio yet, but we're learning.""


The drummer for the group Danny Yamamoto, expanded on how difficult studio musicianship is. ""You're doing it a part at a time,"" he said, ""and not always with the other nine members. You're isolated, and everything is put under a microscope and scrutinized, and that puts you in another frame of mind, instead of just going out one shot and doing it.


""Making a record is a compromise,"" Yamamoto continued. ""The company producer, and the band all have a feeling of what they want. You either compromise, or the record never gets out.""


But Hiroshima refuses to shed the Japanese-influenced sound that makes them unique. Their music is well received in large cities with sizable ethnic populations, and the members of the group say Washington D.C. is the city that has given them the best reception so far.


""People identify with ethnicity and culture,"" Kuramoto said, ""and the fact that we're trying to do it in a musical way.""


Despite a first album and a second, ""Odori,"" that together have sold about 500,000 copies worldwide, and although they have played to packed houses on the concert circuit, the band agrees that their work has only made them ""poorer."" Money is not made from selling records because they owe the record company for production costs, and a profit is not registered from touring because overhead on travel expenses is so high that it's a break even proposition at best.


""Unless you're a big platinum act, you don't make any money,"" Kuramoto summarized.


Johnny Mori, the taiko drummer, explained it simply: ""The harder in debt the more you bet, so more in the hole you go.""


""The record companies don't realize that there is an Asian American market out there that buys out of the middle-class,"" John Kuramoto, manager of Hiroshima, adds. ""But it's bad right now for the music industry all the way around. People are just spending less on music. Kids who used to buy four albums a month now only buy one.""


What's in the future for Hiroshima? What will they do to survive?


""Go into plumbing,"" Mori jokes.


Dan Kuramoto explains. ""If we were going into a career to make money music wouldn't be one of the alternatives. You can't say 'I'll do this because it'll sell' -- that's bullshit. It's a matter of doing our music the best way we know how. Hopefully we could make a reasonable living at it. There's no other reality.""


But having gone from playing for free to selling half a million records in the last 10 years has brought the members of Hiroshima notoriety. They have their faces on thousands of album covers. More people know who they are. Sansei guys in Seattle say they are going to sit in the front row and bring their binoculars to check out Teri Kusamoto, Hiroshima's female lead singer.


""Fame is kind of challenging, it's a responsibility,"" Jesse Acuna, the male lead vocalist for the group, said. ""But on the other hand, I don't really think about it that much. I still play clubs, I still hang with people, so I don't think it's really affected me that much.""


""It's easier to get in contact with people,"" Kuramoto said, ""and it's harder to get to know people because people assume you're something that you're not.""


Ten years ago, Kuramoto didn't envision that Hiroshima would be like this now. ""It's not happening financially, and we don't have a label,"" he said. ""So because of those two things, we can't play enough, and that's really frustrating. But we ain't givin up.""


Hiroshima started getting ready for the gig. Derek Nakamura, the keyboardist, smoked a cigarette and paced around the room. Danny Yamamoto has wandered off to use a chair seat as a practice pad. Peter Hata played his unamplified guitar to himself in a corner.


Seattle's Asian community arrived at the Coliseum early to find good seats. At 9:10, the house lights faded out and spotlights covered the stage with glaring white. Hiroshima punched out their musical representation of Asian Americanism for an hour-and-a-half, performing familiar numbers like ""Kokoro,"" ""Henke No Gari,"" ""Da-Da,"" and ""Lion Dance,"" and tunes leaning toward rock and New Wave that most likely would have been included on a new album.


Johnny Mori's flashy, choreographed taiko drumming, and June Okida Kuramoto's intricate koto solos provided the highlights. The encore brought the Blacks, whites, and Asians to their feet, stomping and clapping along with ""Cruisin J-Town.""


A small crowd gathered outside the Coliseum's glass doors, waiting to see the band members after the concert. A representative of Arista's Seattle branch stood with us and expressed hope that Hiroshima could resolve their differences with his company. John Kuramoto lets in a few people at a time.


""Handling the groupies?"" I asked him.


""No,"" he answered. ""they're good friends.""


Jesse Acuna wiped the sweat off his face with a towel backstage in the dressing room. ""Seattle has been so nice to us,"" he said. ""They brought us up here and put us up at the Park Hilton.""


Dan Kuramoto, leaning against the hallway wall, said, ""See, folks didn't come to hear a bunch of hit songs. They came to hear Hiroshima.""


The post-performance party began, and Hiroshima celebrated because Seattle thought they were all right.

The first biennial convention of the National Network of Asian and Pacific women will be held on June 25, 26 and 27 in San Diego, California. The theme for this convention is ""Linking Leadership for Unity.""


The convention will join Asian and Pacific women leaders from Asian and Pacific women's organizations throughout the country. In 1980, a national conference in Washington, D.C. to discuss ""Women's Educational Equity"" brought together 500 women. It was resolved that a national network be formed with a founding convention in 1982. A national ad hoc committee was elected to develop by-laws for the national network.


In early 1981, our local Asian Pacific Women's Caucus became involved in the ad hoc committee, sponsoring one of the seven regional Department of Labor conferences on the status of Asian and Pacific women in employment.


With the cutback in government funding to address our communities' needs, the de-regulation of affirmative action, and the increased attack on minority and women's communities, the need for a strong network of Asian and Pacific women is apparent and critical.


Among the goals of the Network are to:


-- advance the national visibility of Asian and Pacific women;


-- identify and address the issues of Asian and Pacific women;


-- develop leadership among Asian and Pacific women;


-- strengthen the cause of Asian and Pacific women.


If the Network had been in existence in 1981, it could have played a valuable role in seeking funding for the recommendations from the seven regional employment conferences on the status of Asian and Pacific women's employment. To date, we have documentation of the problems, but lack the political ability to obtain funding for solutions.


It is refreshing to see how carefully the Network has balanced the proposed composition of the Network's Board of Directors. The Board will consist of seven locally-elected regional representatives, three Asian representatives and three Pacific Islanders. No more than one representative from each sub-group within the Asian and Pacific Islander category may serve on the board. The co-chairs will be an Asian and a Pacific Islander. Clearly, the Network wants to include all sectors of the Asian and Pacific community. Washington State is designated within Region 5, along with Alaska, Oregon and Nevada.


The agenda for the three-day conference in San Diego includes a keynote address on ""Building Unity"" by Odetta Fujimori, a member of the Hawaii National Education Association executive board. Jo Uehara, Washington representative for the national YWCA and past president of the Organization of Pan Asian Women in Washington, D.C., will speak on ""National Issues for Asian and Pacific Women.""


Some local Asian Pacific women will attend the conference. If anyone else is interested in attending, please contact me at 447-5859.


The other day I received membership materials from the National Institute for Women of Color. The Institute, incorporated in January of 1981, is primarily concerned with the economic and educational status of women. Onward and upward.

The membership of Cannery Union Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union has elected the first women president in the Union's history with a vote which overwhelmingly went to reform slate candidates, Union officials announced last Friday.


Each of the reform candidates who ran on the Rank and File Committee platform coasted to easy victory, including Terri Mast, who defeated Emma Lawsin 391 votes to 135 for the President/Business Agent post. Mast, widow of slain Local 37 reformer Silme Domingo, was one of the founding members of the Rank and File Committee, which for the past several years has pushed for greater accountability by Union officials to the membership and elimination of long-standing corrupt practices such as bribery in the dispatch procedures.


The Seattle-based union represents 1200 to 1500 workers at 16 Alaska can-. . .


Domingo and Gene Viernes were murdered at the Union hall June 1, 1981. The turmoil that followed included a membership vote to oust Union President Constantine ""Tony"" Baruso after it was revealed that Baruso was the owner of the gun-used as the murder weapon and other allegations surfaced that Baruso was involved in voting fraud and embezzlement of union funds. To date, Baruso has not yet been charged with any crime.


The other newly-elected officers are: Vice-President Leo Lorenzo; Secretary-Treasurer, David Della; Dispatcher Glenn Suson; Trustees, Nemesio Domingo, Sr., Emma Catague and Bernardo Taclay; and Members At Large, Lynn Domingo, Angel Doniego and Myrna Bumlag.


Della, who defeated former Secretary/Treasurer Ponce Torres, pointed out that every single reform slate candidate won election. ""This is a clear mandate from the membership to continue the reform work of the last five years of which Silme and Gene were an important part,"" Della said.


Mast, elated over the margin of victory by Rank and File candidates, however, said that next year's contract negotiations will be critical, as the industry looks at possibly doing away with the seasonal guarantee in wages, a component of all previous contracts negotiated since the inception of Local 37. ""It's going to take competent leadership not to become sold out,"" she said. ""We have to move off the petty squabbles and internal bickering and pull the membership behind us and take on the industry.""


Both Mast and Della said they will make efforts to organize . . . and expand the membership. The union is supported by membership dues.


The union, Mast said will also look at providing year-round employment and attempting to organize workers in the bottomfish and seafood processing areas Della also pointed out that many canneries are moving to provide fresh, frozen fish which is packaged whole much of which is shipped to Japan.


Della said efforts will be made to educate the membership about the purposes of a union and ""clearly define our membership as part of a broad . . . on a national level.

Since May is ethnic heritage month and May 5 is Children's Day in Japan, it is appropriate to look at the teaching of ethnic culture and awareness to young children from two to five years old.


Ethnic differences pervade our daily lives as minorities in America. But several places in Seattle celebrate ethnic diversity and try to instill its value in young children.


Perhaps the largest institution dedicated to a multi-ethnic curriculum for kids is the Early Childcare and Education Program at Seattle Central Community College (SCCC). There, student teachers, learning to become preschool instructors, guide infants and preschoolers who populate beautifully designed and spacious ""labs."" The children are mostly the offspring of students and staff members and reflect wide ethnic diversity.


Gloria Myre, long-time faculty member and promoter of the multi-ethnic curriculum, maintains that just teaching children about a particular ethnic holiday or about geography doesn't work. The entire approach -- including teaching materials, food and staff -- must reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children. She insists that the school ""aggressively teach acceptance of differences"" at an age when children are ""cognitively very cautious of difference."" Of course, Myre adds, it helps when the SCCC day care student teachers themselves reflect such a diverse population.


Judy Suto, director of the Seattle Buddhist Day Nursery, states that the children at the Nursery, now ironically mostly Chinese, get along well, with a minimum of racial name-calling. ""It's no big issue, we just explain everyone is the same,"" she says. The focus is on Japanese phrases, songs and teaching such as counting. The children learn about festivals such as Hana-matsuri (Girls' Day), Bon Odori and Chinese New Year by making paper lanterns or dressing in kimono to learn dances.


All the staff at Buddhist Nursery is Japanese, some second generation. And the children, whose homes are as far away as Bellevue, Redmond and Bainbridge Island, are Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Koreans, Filipinos, Caucasians and Blacks.


Japanese language is also emphasized at Nihongo Preschool, recently opened in the South End by teacher Hiroko Evans. Her students -- mainly Japanese/Caucasian, Japanese American or Caucasian -- learn Japanese customs and speech.


Although English is the native language of the young students, learning a second language at their age is not necessarily confusing. ""The young children are like sponges -- they can learn a lot of things,"" Evans states.


Evans even feels that teaching kanji (Chinese word characters) is easier than teaching kana (syllabary) since the characters are derived from pictures of the objects. ""Very young children can recognize a McDonald's or Mercedes-Benz sign by its shape,"" she points out, so why not kanji, too.


At Denise Louie Childcare Center in the International District, ethnic differences cause some friction, admits director Kathy Wong. Some of the Center's Chinese immigrant families seem to take a dim view of mixing with other races with which they have little familiarity. But Wong takes time to explain to the parents, in their own language, that ethnic differences should be appreciated, not spurned.


In fact, parent education is as important as the bilingual teaching of numbers, words, songs and games at Denise Louie, Despite the difficulties, the Center is one of the few to offer bilingual preschool teaching in more than one language (Chinese, Japanese and Spanish). ""It's very important when they're this young,"" Wong says, ""to make them feel comfortable in easing into another language before they go to public schools.""


SCCC offers a Seattle Childcare Resource Center which is often called on to make presentations far from Seattle's inner city. Classes for parents stress the acceptance of different cultures. Gloria Myre feels, though; that income and age create a greater barrier between parents than race.


Teaching respect and appreciation of ethnic differences can take many forms. For example, at SCCC, says faculty member Shiz Iida, ""We take pictures of the kids and cut pictures from magazines and hang them on the wall."" The pictures, reflecting the children's ethnic diversity comprise an important step toward recognizing and respecting each child's special contribution to Seattle's ethnic richness.

By now, the phrase ""unique blend"" has long been a cliche, but artist Wattana Wattanapun's own unique synthesis of cultural influences brings the dead words irresistably back to mind and reincarnates their vitality. Wattana is a contemporary artist but he brings to his art a sensitive and thorough knowledge of Southeast Asian art, history and religion, which he combines in the cauldron of his imagination with a realistic view of the world and a grounding in modern art.


Wattana, a native of Thailand married to an American, moved to Seattle one year ago. He first came to the United States in 1974 as visiting professor at Oberlin College. Since then he has completed a master's degree at Rhode Island School of Design taught three years at Chiang Mai University in northern Thailand, and returned to the United States to teach at Haverford College, Pennsylvania.


""My work is influenced by mural painting in Thailand and classical Thai painting,"" he says. ""Just like everybody else in Thailand,"" he grew up with the rituals of a traditional Buddhist way of life, but today Buddhism is a ""philosophy of life and a way of living"" which he takes as an inspiration. Buddhism gives him not only images and motifs to be incorporated into his paintings, but also the methods for working to produce them.


In Wattana's painting, the Buddhist concept of impermanence is portrayed through opposing forces which may be translated from recognizable images into abstractions like stillness and motion. His art symbolically embodies the processes he believes are operating in the world today as they have throughout history. Rather than resisting change or labelling it good or bad, he accepts impermanence, the cycles of death and rebirth, as an inevitable part of life. His work reflects ""the reality of the situation, both in art and in society. While some may think what is being expressed is pessimistic, I would say rather it is realistic, for the drastic changes occurring in Thai traditional art and in society are undeniable.""


The names of his works reflect not only their visual content but also the traditions behind them. For example, his latest series is called ""Transformations,"" suggesting the changes in Thai culture as well as the decay of traditional art forms. One painting in the series, ""Moving Stillness,"" evokes in abstract the atmosphere of Buddhist oppositions. Other titles include ""Circumambulation,"" taken from a Buddhist ritual, and ""Two Kinds of Music,"" which juxtaposes traditional Thai musicians and the modern computer.


Widely used in design and ornamentation, the traditional Buddhist motifs of the lotus and the flame, complementary forms like the Chinese yin and yang or, taken as a whole, like the single embodiment of opposites in the Indian Shiva, carry the symbolic connotations of cold and hot, growing and burning, creation and destruction. Another important image is, of course, the sitting Buddha, related to the lotus image because sitting we make ourselves into the lotus shape. Any of these visual symbols may suggest at a glance a whole range of philosophical associations for the viewer familiar with Buddhism.


Besides contributing images and echoes for his painting, Buddhism has also given Wattana the self-discipline to be productive. Ritual is the preparation for a certain moment of action, and art is meditation, Wattana believes. Through disciplined work, he translates these beliefs into paintings completed with skill, care and sophistication.


In spite of his emphasis on tradition, Wattana's paintings will not allow his viewers to forget that he is a contemporary artist. He sees his involvement in modern art as cross-cultural. Not only does he have both Eastern and Western training, he has also taught both Thai and American students.


This summer, students at The Factory School of Visual Art will be able to tap Wattana's knowledge to create their own cultural blends. In one course called ""Dry Pigments,"" he will help students ""explore ways of using pastels, powder pigments, compressed charcoal, charcoal powder, graphite, and other dry mediums."" He will teach them ""how to get the desired effect"" in figurative non-representational or mixed media compositions, all of which he works with himself.


His ""Asian Design and Painting"" class will survey symbols, concepts, patterns and motifs in traditional Southeast Asian art. It will allow students to design their own projects to experiment with techniques of Asian design design, like tempura, gold leaf, lacquerware and rice paper.


Wattana's paintings have been included in exhibits in Thailand and the United States for over a decade. Six of these have been one-man shows. He has also lectured extensively and published 10 articles on art and education in various Thai publications as well as a book on the folk arts of northern Thailand. In addition to his Rhode Island M.A., he holds a B.F.A. in painting from the University of Fine Arts (Silapakorn University) in Bangkok.

NEW YORK, N.Y. -- Chinese restaurant workers, who had organized a two-and-a-half month strike for better work conditions against a midtown restaurant announced last month that their union has signed a contract with the restaurant owners.


The Hawaii Kal Dining Room Union (HKDRU), an independent union organized by Chinese waiters, signed its first contract with China United Restaurant, Inc., owner of the Hawaii Kai Restaurant.


Union members had gone out on strike against the Hawaii Kai Restaurant on March 26 to protest what they called unfair employer labor practices; they were all fired on March 30 because of their unionizing activities.


The management of the Hawaii Kai Restaurant, supported by other Chinese restaurant owners, waged an extensive publicity campaign in the Chinese press to discredit the HKDRU's demands. During the strike, the HKDRU conducted a boycott of the restaurant, with support from groups such as the Chinese Staff and Workers Association and the Asian American Law Students Association. The management temporarily closed the restaurant and even threatened to sell the business to resist the unionization drive.


According to the Union's attorneys, the collective bargaining agreement announced on July 15, contains the best job security provisions in the restaurant industry, including:


-- a successor clause that requires a new owner not only to recognized the HKDRU, but also to assume all the terms of the union contract;


-- a maintenance of benefits provisions that requires management to give employees stand-by pay and medical coverage if the restaurant temporarily closes for up to six months;


-- a restricted discharge clause, which provides that the employer cannot immediately fire an employee for insubordination;


-- a clause permitting employees to strike if the management fails to make contributions to the employee health insurance plan or refuses to turn over authorized dues deductions to the union.


The management also agreed to abide by federal and state minimum wage laws.


One waiter, who worked at the Hawaii Kai for 10 years, commented: ""For the first time, we waiters will have real job security paid holidays, health insurance benefits and decent wages.

An issue which as been ignored in Washington State for nearly 40 years is one which calls for remedying a wrong done to certain State employees just after the beginning of World War II. In 1942 more than 110,000 Americans were uprooted from their homes on the West Coast, simply because of their lapanese ancestry and were herded into American-style concentration camps for the duration of the war under Executive Order, 9066.


Not only did they suffer untold losses in property and businesses, but many Japanese American employees were forced to resign or were dismissed from their jobs under suspicion of disloyalty, or were terminated because they had to leave the area under the evacuation orders. Such orders were sanctioned at that time by Washington's Governor and urged by the State's top legal official the Attorney General According to a recent check of the State records, it appears that approximately 38 employees of the State were probably affected by such involuntary terminations.


On August 17, 1982, Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. of California signed into law Assembly Bill 2710, which entitles compensation of $5,000 to appresimately 314 Japanese American State employees of California who were fired from their jobs in 1942. Assemblyman Patrick Johnston who authored the California compersation bill stated that. ""The Legislature can annually pass resolutions saying how sorry we are for what happened. But if we mean what we say, we will pay back all our loyal former State employees who were victims of the most outrageous campaign of racial discrimination in the history of California."" Johnston added that many of the Senators . . . the era and felt that the governments of the U.S. and California made a terrible mistake and that ""it is time to rectify that error.""


It is time to rectify that error here in Washington State also.


Impact Whenever racial discrimination becomes a factor in whether an employee loses his or her job, that danger threatens the basic civil rights of all minorites. Although a nominal compensation to redress these employees will never atone for the humiliation and the pain of the false accusation of disloyalty, such a gesture will at least show good faith on the part of the State to make amends and to admit that, indeed, a grievous wrong was done to loyal Americans. Such admission would, we hope, help to prevent a recurrence of such racist actions in the future.


Recommendations: It is anticipated that legislation will be introduced at the 48th Legislative session of the Washington State Legislature to compensate any Japanese American state employee who was terminated or forced to resign. We are acutely aware of the tight fiscal problems that the State faces and of the many other priority needs that must because solved, but the ugly existence of racism involved in this situation must also be . . . for the benefit of all minorities. The bill which will be introduced will request a flat $5,000 figure for each employee affected, a token amount considering the three year salary loss and the inflationary erosion. Even if all 38 were to be eligible, over a two-year payout period the amount would approximate $95,000 per year, and over a four-year payout period, only $47,500 a year -- a small price when justice has been so long overdue.

Amy Etsuko Kelley is union steward in the machinist shop at the Boeing Auburn plant. She has worked as a Machinist almost 10 years, starting right out of high school. Before she got the opportunity to join an apprenticeship program, she was a trainee on a milling machine for two years. Kelley graduated from the program in 1977, after four years of learning to operate all the different machines in a machine shop. During that period, she took classes on the theory behind her work.


""The job's not glamorous. It's hard, it's dirty and you're required to have your own tools, which is expensive,"" she says. But Kelley enjoys her work, and knows that a machinist's salary - $10-$13 per hour - makes the job attractive.


Kelley entered the trade at a good time in the early 70's, when, because of the women's movement, unions were looking for women and minorities to enter their apprenticeship programs. Even though she was one of the first women in the program, she had few problems with the men she had to work with. ""It's really surprising,"" she explained. ""I think it's mainly because I'm really outgoing, and I don't let things bother me. I just became one of the guys. They saw I could do the work, so they accepted me.""


Last fall, Kelley was elected by over 100 union members to represent them as shop steward. Kelley also is on the union's Human Rights Commission.


According to Kelley, because of the current economic situation, apprenticeships are not available, ""but that shouldn't stop anybody from taking the training."" Kelley suggests the training program at Renton Vocational School for those interested in becoming machinists.


She said girls in high school interested in becoming machinists should take courses in math and science, especially chemistry and physics, and metal shop. ""It's a good time to see it you like this kind of work before committing yourself,"" she says. ""And it doesn't hurt a woman to learn how to use some of the tools just for survival.""

There does ""not appear to be a pressing public need"" for continuing the State Commission on Asian American Affairs, according to a report issued by a legislative auditor last month.


The Commission, charged with making recommendations on program and law changes pertaining to Asian Americans, operates out of an office in Seattle's International District.


The Commission is currently involved in: the Asian Pacific American Affirmative Action Network, serving as resource agency for the Governor's affirmative action policy committee, various refugee task forces and the King County Indochinese farm project.


The auditor's report states that the Commission should be allowed to terminate as scheduled on June 30, 1983, the date the statute which created the Commission expires.


According to the auditor, the services provided by the Commission ""have been of some value"" to the Asian community, but ""there is no body of evidence to indicate that those services are in fact needed.""


The auditor points out that no other state has an Asian American Affairs Commission on the state level and that no corresponding commission exists for Blacks in this state. The Commission provides few direct services, the auditor's report adds.


However, Vivian Luna, director of the Commission, differs with the auditor's report on whether the Commission is truly needed. ""With the growing number of Asian Pacific Americans -- including the many new arrivals to this country -- we need a liaison agency at the state level with access to both community groups and state bureaucracy,"" she said.


One important and unique function of the Commission is to coordinate joint lobbying efforts by Asian community groups, she said. The auditor's report also does not take into account many intangibles, Luna said, which are key in evaluating the question of whether the Commission should continue.


The Commission often plays an active role in informing community groups about various types of racist legislation such as the Simpson/Mazzoli immigration bill currently in the U.S. Congress, Luna said. ""The Commission helps to educate people about these types of laws before they are passed and helps coordinate efforts to oppose them,"" she added.


Luna said she views the negative audit of the Commission as part of the State Legislature's lack of commitment to social and health programs serving minority and low-income groups.


The Commission will hold its next meeting June 19 in Tacoma, at which time there will be discussion about mobilizing current and past Commissioners to lobby for continuation of the Commission. A group such as ""Friends of the Commission"" might be created out of a network of supporters state-wide, Luna said, from contacts in Seattle, Snohomish, and Pierce Counties, the Yakima Valley, and other areas.


Luna said, however, that the Governor's office has expressed support for continuation of the Commission. And she's hopeful community groups will also come forth to write letters and make phone calls on behalf of the Commission. For more information, call the Commission at 464-5820

As I sat in my third grade class, I stared out the window. I was looking forward to recess. I was anxious to get out onto the playground for kickball Finally. the bell rang and I ran wildly down the stairs to the playground. It was a great feeling, running free with a warm wind gently stroking my face.


The kickball game started right away. My team was up. Judy kicked the ball over second base into centerfield and ran all the way to third base. She yelled back to me, ""Kick me home!"" Just as the pitcher rolled the ball toward me, three kids started to chant, ""Ching Chong Chinaman. I told them to shut up, but they kept badgering me. On the third pitch. I kicked a flyball to the first baseman. Darn! I wished those kids would leave me alone.


The bell sounded again and it was time to go back to class. On the way into the building. I heard a child say, ""Hey slant eyes! Can't you kick a decent ball?"" My face turned red from anger and frustration.


It has been over 23 years since that incident took place. I'm sure thousands of other Asian children have experienced similar indignities. It is not an uncommon occurrence though it should be.


I have often wondered how the present generation of Asian American children feel about themselves. There have been civil rights advancement and an increased awareness of racial discrimination, but people's attitudes don't change quickly.


This question led me to a graduate research project. In 1980, I got 29 Japanese American children from grades 4 to 6 to answer a set of 89 questions. The questionnaire was designed to find out how the children felt about themselves. I compared their answers with the answers of 47 Caucasian kids. All the children live in the greater Seattle area.


The questionnaire asked the children about six major areas in their lives intelligence, popularity, behavior, anxiety, happiness and physical characteristics. The only significant difference between the Japanese and Caucasian groups was in the area of physical characteristics. The Japanese children did not like their appearance as much as the white children. Many of the Japanese American children weren't as happy with the shape of their eyes and nose. They also showed an uneasiness about their height. Overall, though the total self-concept of the two groups wasn't significantly different.


I wasn't surprised at the results, Asian American children still seem to be battling the same problem of ethnic stereotypes that I did when I was their age. Negative stereotypes of Asians abound in newspapers, magazines, trade publications and television.


Parents should be aware of the importance of talking about ethnic membership and racial physical characteristics. They should reinforce in their children a positive attitude about ethnicity. This reinforcement should start at infancy and continue through adolescence.


Parent's are usually very excited about their, infants' physical features Sometimes parents will say, ""What beautiful brown eyes the baby has, Or ""I love the baby's soft skin Parents should continue to verbalize those positive feelings to children as they grow. For exampleparents can repeatedly tell their three-year-old at various times what great looking hair he has and what great color his hair is. And when children are interested in drawing self-portraits, parents can have them carefully look at themselves in a full-length mirror. Explain to the children that they should try to use many crayon colors. Ask them to look at their face and have them use black to color in their hair and brown for their eyes. They should be encouraged to use colors to accurately create self-portraits Parents then could continually praise their children's work no matter how small the accomplishment may seem. For. example, parents may say. I really like the way you colored your hair black You look great. The picture looks just like you. ""Children can also be encouraged to color in a skin cone on their pictures. addition. children may be directed to carefully observe what they are wearing so the colors of those items can be added to their portraits.


We live in a very busy world. Children are bombarded with many images both good and bad. It is the responsibility of parents to help guide their children through the maze of life, One way we can help children grow is to instill in them at an early age a strong, and positive sense of ethnic heritage. A healthy identity will help children cope successfully with the negative images and derogatory remarks which they will encounter through life.

Renowned photographer Johsel Namkung is an artist whose life has taken many turns. Namkung was born in Korea in 1919. His father was a theologian who graduated from Princeton and taught Greek and Hebrew at a seminary. Namkung grew up in a ""culturally endowed"" home, filled with music and art, ""although according to Oriental custom, boys were not encouraged to follow in the ways of art,"" he said.


""I've been attracted both by the visual arts and the performing arts since my early teens,"" Namkung explained. At an early age he considered becoming a painter, but by age 13, ""the pulling from music was stronger than the pulling from painting,"" he said.


In 1936, at the age of 17, Namkung went to the Tokyo Conservatory of Music, where he studied European music, especially voice. In Japan, he met his wife Mineko, an artist who does mostly abstract paintings.


During most of World War II, the Namkungs were in Shanghai, which was under Japanese military control. Namkung taught music, and, with his wife, assisted in the organization of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra. During the early 1940's, Namkung began to experiment with photography.


At the end of the War, the Namkung family lived in a missionary compound connected with the theological seminary where Namkung's father taught. At the compound, the Namkungs received extensive exposure to Western culture.


In 1947, at the age of 27, Namkung moved his family to Seattle, where he was admitted to University of Washington's Music Department.


Namkung's major interest in music is German lieder, ""a very specialized field,"" Namkung explained. ""I resisted the University's attempts to recruit me as an opera singer and performed in only one opera, The Magic Flute, at the old Meany Hall,"" he said.


""I never liked to do anything but German lieder, which is quite esoteric in this country.""


While doing his graduate work in music, he organized the Asian material in the Music Department's archives and taught Japanese language in the Far East Department.


After completing his graduate work, in 1952. Namkung accepted a position with Northwest Orient Airlines as a language specialist. ""During that time I was not able to perform or work on my musical career so I picked up photography as a means of expression,"" he explained.


Five years later, Namkung decided to become a professional photographer and left the Airline. He apprenticed himself to Chao-Chen Yang, an expert in color photography, and then took a position with one of the leading photographic laboratories in Seattle to learn his new art.


Namkung specializes in three types of photography. He is best known for his nature photographs. Since the publication of his first book. The Olympic Rainforest, in 1966, he has been recognized as one of Seattle's foremost artists.


Namkung said when he photographs nature he tries to photograph what other people overlook, ""like the flowers on the roadside other people would trample over, I find great beauty in.""


Namkung is also a medical photographer at the University of Washington, specializing in electron microscopy, the study of micro-organisms and tissues. He took up medical photography because, I thought I had to do something for humanity.""


His third area of specialty is photographing illustrations for art books. Namkung prefers natural light for his photographs, but said he uses tungston lights for photographing sculptures.


Namkung has a laboratory near the University campus where he does all his own printing, and says he uses all format sizes of cameras from 35 millimeter to 8 x 10 view cameras. ""I use 35 millimeter very casually, for different purposes, when I lecture, and for slide shows,"" he explained. Most of his work is done with view cameras, however.

King County Executive Randy Revelle, echoing the words of Seattle Mayor Charles Royer, has asked that he be given ""a bit more of a chance"" to hire Asians to top level administrative positions. Are we to believe that he will be different from other elected officials heavily supported by Asians and actually fulfill his campaign promise to affirmatively hire Asians?


Randy Revelle ran as a liberal Democrat and defeated conservative Ron Dunlap by the narrowest of margins. In Southeast Seattle, where there is a high concentration of Asians, Revelle picked up 62 per cent of the vote. Charles Royer, the first time he ran, gathered about the same percentage of votes in that district. In his bid for re-election, the Mayor was able to pack the halls of the Nippon Kan Theatre with Asians for a campaign fundraiser.


There is no question that most Asian voters supported Revelle and Royer. Revelle and Royer got substantially more money from Asians than did their opponents, both in terms of total dollars and number of contributors. They also had many active and reliable Asian campaign workers.


Yet, despite this support, both do not have any Asian department heads. Royer did, however, appoint James Kamihachi as director of the Office of Policy and Evaluation, an office which was later abolished by the City Council and with it the director's position.


Both Revelle and Royer have said that they could not find highly qualified Asian candidates; that argument is difficult, at best to swallow.


By his own admission, Revelle appointed Shelly Yapp as director of the Budget Office and Lauraine Brekke as director of County administration without going through an elaborate search becasue he wanted them for those positions. Why didn't he do the same for an Asian? While Yapp and Brekke have credentials, they do not have exceptional qualifications for their respective positions.


Revelle's appointment of Holly Miller as director of Planning and Community Development over an Asian candidate who didn't make it as a finalist raises some real doubts about his commitment to Asians. A review of Miller's resume shows that she worked mostly as assistant to a top administrator at the U.S. Department of Interior and as an assistant to the Commissioner of Natural Resources for the State of Georgia. She had minimal management experience running a large department and in community planning and zoning at the local level, which are two of the main functions of the Planning and Community Development Department.


One of the other finalists for the position was the former Budget Director for the County who had even less experience in community planning, zoning and development than Miller.


The Asian candidate had three years of management experience in community development at the local level, including one year's experience running a department, and 14 years of urban planning experience. The Asian candidate's qualifications were at least equal to the others, if not superior.


For the Mayor's part, he has appointed such notables as Don Dudley, the businessman who operated a failing radio station and who had no experience in the public sector; Bob Murray energy consultant with little management experience who even the Mayor got disillusioned with; and Darel Grothaus, who had plenty of ideas, but little administrative experience.


Being highly qualified is obviously not a prerequisite for a department directorship. Surely there are lots of Asians, even locals, who have enough experience and leadership to be good directors. After all, other cities with a relatively significant Asian population such as San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles do not seem to have a difficult time finding Asians to head major departments.


Could it be that Revelle and Royer think that Asians are inconsequential?"" That they can get Asians to support them -- when Revelle runs for re-election and Royer for Governor -- without naming an Asian department head? ""Well, you know that Asians are rational and patient people. Remind them about 'delayed gratification,' tell them that they are not ready for directorships, that they are not as qualified. At least there are no local Asians that can fit the bill; but we will make a national search and find an Asian -- who rejects being Asian, who will be reluctant to meet or do favors for the community, who will think of what is best for every citizen, and who, above all, knows his or her 'place.'""


Revelle and Royer know the political implications of not hiring Asians to top level administrative positions. Whether Asians will continue to support them will, in part, depend on their future performance.


The recent re-organization being proposed for the City's Department of Community Development will result in the elimination of a top administrative position currently held by an Asian. The City and community can ill afford to lose another Asian administrator. If the Mayor chooses to reorganize that department as proposed, he can still find that Asian another job in the City. That would demonstrate he acknowledges that person's management abilities and his commitment to affirmative action.


Revelle has been in office for eight months and has filled five department directorships. He will have the opportunity to fill four or five key administrative positions over the next few months.


We want to believe that our votes meant something. We should give Royer and Revelle time to produce. At least until election time comes around.

Within the next four to six weeks, Metro will decide which three or four sites it will study for constructing a south transit terminal, project officials told a gathering of about 30 International District and Pioneer Square representatives earlier this month at the Wing Luke Memorial Museum.


International District organizations, in the past, have expressed concern over potential congestion, pollution, traffic and parking problems such a terminal might impose on the District.


Metro, which last spring adopted a Transit 1990 plan for King County, expects to double its level of transit service. To relieve transit congestion in the Central Business District, Metro will construct a pedestrian mall downtown, with transit terminals at the north and south ends of the mall. Commuters, coming into downtown from outlying areas, would step off diesel buses at the terminal, then board circulator buses -- either light rail cars or electric trolleys -- which would carry them into the Central Business District.


Jim Parsons, the City's project manager for the Downtown Transit Project, described, to the joint meeting of the International District and Pioneer Square Special Review Boards, five potential sites for the south terminal: Fourth Avenue South and Royal Brougham Way; the small park south of the King County administration building downtown; and Yesler Way, between Fourth and Fifth Avenues.


Project representatives said they will study either three or four sites in detail and prepare an environmental impact statement by late this year.


Joe Miller, manager of the Downtown Transit Project, said selection of a south transit terminal site will depend on ""which system will best function, coupled with the impact on the surrounding areas."" Cost ""would not stand in the way of the best solution,"" Miller added, unless the costs were outrageous.


Parsons said the Royal Brougham site, located quite a distance from the Central Business District, has little potential for joint use development in contrast to Union Station property which has space behind the existing building for joint development. Because of its proximity to downtown, the park site next to the County administration building would decrease the number of persons transferring from diesel buses to circulator buses, encouraging greater pedestrian traffic in downtown, he added.


Bob Santos, director of the International District Improvement Association, said his organization prefers the Royal Brougham site for the south terminal. ""It spreads out the congestion, especially on stadium days,"" he said. Santos, who is a member of the Downtown Seattle Transit Project Advisory Committee, said the Union Station site would create additional pollution and traffic problems for the District.


Glenn Chinn, president of the International District Merchants Parking Association and also a member of the Downtown Seattle Transit Project Advisory Committee, said he favors the Union Station site. ""If we are trying to anchor King Street as the commercial center of the District, it's the best site,"" he said.


And the International District Economic Association has tentatively endorsed the Union Station site particularly if the site is used for joint development with the International District and if adverse impacts such as traffic congestion and pollution can be mitigated.

The Indochinese refugees did not choose to leave their homeland and come to a country of foreign customs, language and values. They did not choose to be looked down on as they crowded into apartments with other refugee families to save money. They did not choose to divorce their spouse, or, as in one particular case, commit suicide to have their family quality for federal aid to families with dependent children.


Bob Johnson, regional director of the International Rescue Committee, depicted the situation facing Indochinese refugees in his testimony before the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs November 20.


Johnson was one of approximately 25 representatives of groups who testified at a public hearing on issues confronting Asian Pacific Americans, the largest minority group in King County. The hearing, held at the King County Council chambers, centered predominately on prevailing discrimination and financial needs of the community.


Almost 10,000 Indochinese refugees in Washington will lose cash assistance and medical coupon benefits because of a shattering change in the refugee welfare regulations, Johnson testified.


Gail Tanaka, director of the International District Community Health Center, said that because of federal cutbacks, the Center has seen a significant increase in the number of refugee clients.


Stephen Sumida, assistant professor in the Department of Comparative American Cultures at Washington State University (WSU), suspects racist pressures are building more pervasively than people are conscious of.


Kepresenting the Asian American community at WSU, Sumida said the Ku Klux Klan is now an active organization at Washington State University and not far from campus sits the Church of the Aryan Nation, a self-proclaimed ""Nazi Church.""


Tancredo Verzosa, a community citizen, told the Commission about a racial discrimination suit he initiated against the world's largest stock brokers.


For too long Verzosa suffered blows to his dignity while employed at Merrill Lynch. He watched a young man he had trained and other less experienced white men move to higher positions in the company while he remained at his entry level job.


Verzosa finally asked his employer to consider him for a higher paying, more responsible position. His boss offered him a job washing windows in his Broadmoor home for $2 an hour.


James Hattori, KING-TV reporter, talked about the portrayal of Asian Pacific Americans in the local media. Hattori said the power of the media to inform, enlighten, question, probe and entertain must not be overlooked nor underestimated. Hattori encouraged Asian Pacific Americans ""to speak their minds, to harbor no fears of the press, and to continue to make a stand for what is justly theirs.""


At the University of Washington (UW), Asian enrollment, particularly in the Schools of Dentistry, Law, and Medicine, has declined with the tendency for Asian students to major in Engineering, Business, and Computer Science, said Herman D. Lujan, vice-president of Minority Affairs at the University of Washington.


According to Lujan, Asian students need to be exposed to other employment options at an early age to meet broader needs of the community. The financial cutbacks at the UW will hit most strongly the minority, adult learners and lower-income students; tuition will be hard to afford and entrance requirements will be more competitive.


The draft of the Revised Plan for Higher and Post Secondary education: 1983-89 could seriously affect minority students in the Educational Opportunities Program, said Lujan. The draft plan suggests that entering university freshmen be limited to the top 15 percent of high school graduating classes. According to Lujan, this draft would limit minority access to the University of Washington.


The Commission panelists -- State Representative Art Wang, King County Council member Ruby Chow, Seattle City Council member Dolores Sibonga, and members of the Commission on Asian American Affairs -- listened all day to testimony from a diversity of Asians including the Palouse, Asian American Association in Pullman and an Asian Pacific American woman machinist in Auburn.


Ironically, while the Commission listened to testimony from organizations struggling with financial losses, the Commission itself faces an uncertain future. The Commission will be terminated in June unless ""Friends of the Commission"" and other volunteers are able to counter a negative legislative recommendation through lobbying and publicity efforts.

Americans are getting more sophisticated about Chinese food these days, and most of them want to try something more adventurous than chop suey and chow mein. But with this growing sophistication is a tendency to believe that you can become an expert on Chinese food in two easy steps:


1) make a sweeping condemnation of Cantonese food;


2) rave about the spicy hot food of Hunan or Szech wan (more points if you spell the latter as Sichuan in the news system).


To accommodate this new wave of customers, restaurants put stars on their menus to indicate how hot a dish is, from one star (mildly hot) to five stars (guaranteed to char your tongue and palate). It has become a macho thing to boast about the hot-hot food you can eat without breaking into tears. One little kid will say to another. ""My dad can eat more stars than your dad.""


But you can't become a gourmet overnight, according to the Chinese. Take my grandfather as an extreme case. He was a crusty old tyrant who used to keep a household of women busy in the kitchen with tweezers to pick out the tiny feathers from his birdnest soup. He claimed that it took three generations to produce a gourmet. The first generation of nouveau riche showed off their wealth with expensive clothes. The second generation spent money on furniture. Only by the third generation did you get a man who appreciated the finest thing in life: food.


My grandfather was very biased in his tastes. He was from Nanking, an area famous for its stir-fried dishes and freshwater fish. He used to insist that freshwater prawns, to be a truly elegant dish, should be stir-fried alone, with a minimum of seasoning, so that nothing distracted you from the flavor of the prawns. If he saw even a few slivers of bamboo shoots or snow peas (put there by the cook to stretch the dish), he would fly into a rage.


His worst tantrums were for over-spiced food. Our wily cook knew that if the dish was spicy you'd eat less of it and shovel down more rice, which was cheaper. Hot peppers, my grandfather claimed, were used to disguise ingredients that were not completely fresh. He had a point. The world's spiciest cuisines belong mostly to the warmer climates, where food spoils easily.


My grandfather, of course, was only reflecting a regional bias in his preferences. Speaking of regional food, I notice that many beginning experts in Chinese food tend to confuse northern, mandarin and Szechwan cooking. I suppose they lump these together because they are all non-Cantonese. The three are actually quite distinct.


Northern China is the region north of the Yellow River, and since rice doesn't grow well in the climate, northern food features a lot of wheat breads and noodles. Garlic is the most notable symptom of northern cooking. What some northerners consider a delectable salad consists of raw garlic cloves marinated in vinegar. A favorite breakfast is rice gruel topped by grated fresh garlic. Foreign tourists in Peking riding the bus during morning rush hour are sometimes knocked flat by the breath of the other riders, who have come fresh from their breakfasts.


Szechwan is a large, mountainous province in western China and, as we all know, noted for its hot cuisine. The sourhot soup served in so many so-called northern restaurants is actually Szechwan. In China, we use this soup as a convenient way to take care of leftovers. We just chop up the leftovers, add water, cornstarch, vinegar, sesame oil, plus all the loose pepper in the house, and presto; instant sour-hot soup.


Hunan cooking is the latest star (stars?) to burst over the American restaurant scene -- burst like a rocket, that is. I went to school briefly in Human, and I remember that for school lunch we had hot peppers stir-fried with viciously hot peppers. That was how we got our vitamins. On the way home from school I used to pass stalls where orange-colored strips of dried meat were hanging -- a Hunan version of beef jerky. My parents warned me never to buy food from open stalls, since heaven knows how many zillions of flies had paid their calls. Frankly, no fly would come within two feet of those strips of meat, which were thickly coated with powdered red pepper. Just thinking about it makes me want to sneeze.


In contrast, Cantonese food is mildly seasoned. These days it's fashionable in certain circles to dismiss Cantonese food as chop suey. Actually, Cantonese haute cuisine is subtly flavored, and is both expensive and difficult to prepare. Many specialties, like shark's fin and winter melon soup using the whole melon, takes hours to cook properly.


No wonder some of us take the easy way out by serving our guests (those who don't know any better) undistinguished dishes pepped up with spices. To make it ""northern,"" we simply throw in a handful of chopped garlic; and to make it ""Hunan,"" we empty the pepper pot. These ingredients are inexpensive, and enable our guests to go home with their mouths satisfactorily smoking.


Finally, what is mandarin food, exactly? The word ""mandarin"" isn't even Chinese, but comes from the Malay language and was used by the European colonial powers to mean a native official. In time, mandarin came to mean primarily a Chinese of the ruling class in pre-revolutionary China. Mandarin food, therefore, was supposed to be the cuisine of the ruling class.


Although the capital of imperial China was Peking (now Beijing) mandarins came from all parts of the country, and mandarin food was not confined to northern cooking. Nor was it necessarily spicy hot. A mandarin from Szechwan or Hunan might be addicted to his jar of hot peppers, but many other Chinese aristocrats liked to have their palates tickled by delicate flavors, not zapped by an exploding rocket.


We don't rate vintage wines by their alcoholic content, and we shouldn't rate Chinese food by its spiciness. To start a Chinese meal by eating a five-star dish is like starting a wine tasting session by gulping down a glass of neat gin.


Some Chinese like their food hot. Others, such as my grandfather, prefer it cool, real cool.

One year I didn't have mochi for breakfast on New Year's Day. And it was the worst year of my life. Whether or not my mochi-less first meal of the new year had anything to do with my run of bad luck that year, I vowed never to miss my New Year's mochi again.


Mochi is a sticky rice cake made from a sweeter, more glutinous rice than regular Japanese rice that is steamed, then pounded into a dough. While still steaming hot, the dough is shaped into round cakes or balls, or flattened into a sheet to be cut into squares, using rice powder to keep the gooey dough from sticking to the mochi maker's hands.


In Japan, the mochi-tsuki, rice pounding ceremony, takes place a few days before the new year, and is a festive occasion, particularly for the rural villages. Traditionally the steamed rice was pounded in wooden tubs with huge mallets, until the mochi was pulverized and ready to be shaped.


Machines that grind the mochi have now replaced the pounding method, and most people, both in Japan and in America, buy their mochi from the store, already made. But mochi is still the most important food of the biggest Japanese holiday.


There are many ways to eat mochi. It can be grilled, either over hot coals, or in an oven or electric broiler, until the mochi puffs up to twice its original size, with a crispy shell and a soft, chewy center. Mochi toasted in this manner can then be dipped in a soy sauce and sugar mixture eaten with toasted seaweed, or I've been told, has been westernized so much as to be eaten with butter, cheese, or even applesauce.


A method for preparing grilled mochi that became popular centuries ago at an inn on the Abe River, between the then capital city Kyoto and the city of Edo (now called Tokyo), where travelers stopped for refreshments, is called Abe kawa mochi. Grilled mochi is dipped in water to moisten the surface, and then rolled in a mixture of soy flour (kinako), sugar and a little salt.


The traditional breakfast on New Year's Day is a soup that can contain many different ingredients, but that always has mochi. The contents of Ozoni -- which translates to ""simmered miscellany"" -- varies from area to area, and probably from family to family, but it typically contains chicken shrimp and vegetables with a dried fish soup base and soy sauce. I like mochi in miso soup, because it is easy to prepare. Just dissolve the miso in some broth and throw the mochi in until it's warmed through and gooey.


Mochi keeps for several days, one of the reasons it is a popular festival food since the New Year's celebration lasts several days in Japan. Mochi can be frozen for months, and some people say you are supposed to eat one mochi for each year of your . . . the new year. That tradition is usually only applied to children, however, or at least the number gets spread out through the month of January for adults.


The word mochi also means ""to have"" or ""to hold or possess,"" so mochi -- the rice cakes -- are sometimes a symbol of wealth.


The round cakes also symbolize a mirror, one of the ancient imperial treasures and are used as offerings in the Shinto religion. A kind of pyramid of three mochi, sometimes with a mikan (mandarin orange) on top is one of six offerings made to Buddha, for the new year. The otsunae is put on the altar along with other objects related to the five senses as a statement of reverence and commitment to work on the five senses, to purify them so that the world can be experienced more clearly.


Even without the traditional pounding, getting together to make mochs is a major project for the families that have the equipment to grind the mochi. My relatives get together to steam about 50 pounds of mochigome (the special rice used for mochi) outside on a gas stove, and then grind the mochi in a large machine similar to a meat grinder that forces the mochi out in a tube shape ready to be cut and shaped.


George and Mari Tamura owners of Tobo's say their family gets together each year to make mochi for the family and a few of their customers. ""It's really an all day venture,"" according to Mari Tamura. ""We start about 9:00 in the morning, and after cleaning up and everything, it takes until about 10:00 that night.""


Machines that both cook and prepare small quantities of mochi for shaping are becoming popular in Japan, and are available here in Seattle at Tobo's and other specialty shops for about $210. Though the machine can only prepare about three pounds of mochi at a time, the cooking and agitating process have the mochi ready for shaping in about 45 minutes making it possible to have fresh mochi all year round.


The biggest mochi making production for New Year's in town is at Japanese Baptist Church. For three days -- this year on December 28 29 and 30 -- the church members get together to make over 2,000 packages of one dozen mochi each. The church fundraising event uses about a ton of rice, and has been an annual event at the church for at least 15 years. The mochi will sell for $2.50 a package and can be preordered from the church office at 622-7351.

By withholding half of his 1982 personal income tax in protest of the United States involvement in nuclear arms, the Reverend Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle believes he is just being honest with himself.


""I cannot in conscience contribute to the construction of nuclear arms which is intrinsically evil,"" he said in an interview. ""I have to be honest with myself. I am not doing this for people to follow me. I prefer that each individual comes to his own decision what should be done to meet the nuclear arms challenge. But with my decision I feel a great sense of integrity.""


Awareness of possible imprisonment -- at worst -- and harsh criticisms for withholding fifty percent of his income tax certainly played a role in making the decision, but Archbishop Hunthausen contends that the church has to speak on issues that touch man's life.


""It's not only my right but my responsibility to speak to society,"" he said. ""I believe that as Christians imbued with the spirit of peacemaking expressed by the Lord in the Sermon on the Mount, we must find ways to make known our objections to the present concentration on further nuclear arms buildup.""


Ever since Archbishop Hunthausen identified the Trident as ""the Auschwitz of Puget Sound"" he has received both praise and criticism. Many lay people, priests, and nuns have found him to be a source of strength and vision. The Archdiocese of Seattle has set aside Monday as a day of prayer and fasting for nuclear disarmament. The Washington Association of Churches passed a resolution that includes a unanimous statement of support for Archbishop Hunthausen's quest for peace and nuclear disarmament, and opposition to nuclear proliferation at the time of the arrival of the Trident submarine at Bangor.


But other have also criticized Archbishop Hunthausen for being naive on the unilateral disarmament question. In an interview with the St. Anthony Messenger, he defends himself by saying, ""If we were to make the decision to begin to unilaterally disarm and to redirect our billions of dollars toward the needy of the world, that would have an impact on the world and nations -- perhaps other than the Soviet Union -- but with a ripple effect on countries like the Soviet Union.... We've simple got to acknowledge that we are a diminishing world in need of one another. Either we draw together and become one family, or we annihilate ourselves. While this may seem idiocy to certain people, I have to say that what they are proposing is idiocy. I can see the end of their scenario, namely annihilation, but I can't see the end of the scenario I try to portray.""


On the issue of polarizing the Archdiocese of Seattle, he explains, ""I am not attempting to divide the Christian community. I pray that because of our openness and respect for one another, we can grow together by our concentration on the goal of world peace and eventual elimination of nuclear arms despite our disagreements over the best way to achieve such goals.""


Despite the criticisms by some on his position. Hunthausen confides that his stand on the immorality of building destructive materials is in consonance with the teaching of the Church. Quoting from The Church in the Modern World, he declares, ""The arms race is one of the greatest curses on the human race and the harm it inflicts on the poor is more that can be endured."" A similar sentiment is echoed by the late Pope Paul VI when he addressed the United Nations, ""The arms race is to be condemned unreservedly. The obvious contradiction between the waste involved in the over-production of military devices and the extent of unsatisfied vital needs ... is in itself an act of aggression which amounts to a crime for even when they are not used, by their cost alone armaments kill the poor by causing them to starve.""


Archbishop Hunthausen might not become a pope like Paul VI, but he has certainly provided moral leadership to his flock at the time they need it most. His greatness lies not so much in his courage to withhold his income tax, but in his ability to challenge an institution that has lost respect for human life.

If you haven't noticed, lately there is the beautiful sound of electrical saws and the pulsating beat of hammers as the International District undergoes construction.


The ID Preservation and Development Authority is renovating the New Central Hotel into 28 one-bedroom units for our low-income elderly and handicapped persons under the Neighborhood Strategy Areas Program (NSA). Renovation of the New Central and the Jackson Hotel follows rehabilitation of the Bush Hotel and will fulfill part of the NSA goal of providing 225 units of low-income subsidized housing under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 program.


Also under construction on Maynard Ave. So is the Freedman Hotel which will become 20 units of market rate housing for young couples and other working people who want to live in town.


On the east end of the District, we have the House of Hong Restaurant, just months away from opening. On the western border, new twin theaters near completion.


These latest development in the District -- and past projects such as the Bush-Asia Center, International House International Terrace and Imperial House -- did not come easily. The community got together to advocate for the necessary government support to make these projects become reality.


In the past, community groups, working together, have been able to leverage for benefits to the community to offset public developments like, for example. Interstate 5, which was built on the east side of the District. Hundreds of people in the single family sector of the District were displaced by the construction of I-5. But the ID was able to negotiate for the air space below the freeway to develop and operate a 18-stall parking lot. And the International District Merchants Parking Association, which came into existence to manage the lot, got its beginning. The community-based. Association now operates 14 parking lots in the International District.


When the King County Domed Stadium was constructed on the western flank of the District, officials, forced to mitigate the impacts of the stadium on the District, negotiated contracts for funding of the International Community Health Center, the Denise Louise Child Care Center and $1.8 million in street improvements. Subsequent negotiations led to the allocation of approximately 800 units of subsidized housing for our low-income residents.


Other planned development, such as the conversion of Union Station into an Intermodel Transportation Terminal by the Port of Seattle, was never allowed to proceed because the negative impacts were too great to be neutralized by any positive factors. In other words, we would have gotten nothing in return.


The ID community also flexed its collective muscle when confronted by the planned conversion of the Immigation and Naturalization Building into a facility for a 300-bed work release program. This program never had a chance because 100 percent of the community -- businesses, residents and social services -- adamantly opposed the concept.


Which brings us to Metro's new planned development and the State's I-90 project. We have a responsibility to our community to negotiate amenities to the community if and when these projects are built.


In the very near future, Metro will develop its long planned and discussed South Terminal. Metro plans to build two terminals, one north and one south, where Metro's diesel buses will deposit commuters traveling to Seattle from outlying areas such as Mercer Island, Bellevue, Renton and Burien. At the terminals, commuters would catch circulator buses which would take them to the Central Business District to shop or work.


Three sites are now being discussed for the South Terminal: Union Station; the block bounded by Yesler and Washington, 4th and 5th South; and the park next to the King County Courthouse. As you may have noticed, Metro has dropped the site at 4th and Royal Brougham although ID persons and organizations strongly requested it continue to be studied.


I-90 access is also coming up. Roughly, the plan brings in traffic from the east, from areas like Mercer Island and Bellevue. This project has the potential of creating traffic jams during rush hour and during Kingdome events.


With the Metro terminal and I-90 upon us, we, as a community, must decide what is acceptable and what would be so detrimental it cannot be allowed. We, as a community, have had enough experience to know that mitigating measures are not included as part of a project without prodding from the community.


Our community has the image of being well oiled and successful in preserving its integrity. We must continue to work together for the good of the community.

King County Executive Randy Revelle earlier this month announced the lease of 22 acres of vacant county land in the Sammamish Valley to the Indochinese Farm Project. The Project is a demonstration program to help Hmong and Mien refugees use their agricultural heritage and experience to become productive farmers in the United States.


The Indochinese Farm Project is the result of over two years of work by local community groups and governmental agencies. Representatives from the Bethany Presbyterian Church, the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs, the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority, the King County Cooperative Extension Office, and the King County Office of Agriculture worked together on the Indochinese Farm Project Task Force to develop the pilot program.


""This pilot program offers an exciting opportunity for King County government to work cooperatively, with local organizations to help Indochinese refugee families pursue a productive farming career in the United States,"" said Revelle.


King County has over 20,000 Indochinese refugees, one of the largest refugee populations in the country. There are over 1,200 Hmong refugees and 2,000 Mien refugees in King County alone.


The Indochinese Farm Project began when leaders in the local Hmong and Mien communities expressed interest in learning how to farm the fertile soils of the Pacific Northwest. The Hmong and Mien were subsistence farmers in the mountainous regions of northern Laos. They aided United States troops during the Vietnam War and were forced to flee Laos after the Communist takeover.


The Indochinese Farm Project will teach the refugees how to manage a farm and how to market their crops. The Project plans to specialize in Asian vegetables -- such as bok choy, Chinese cabbage, and Japanese parsley -- since local demand for these vegetables has increased in recent years.


The pilot Project provides an excellent opportunity for 19 refugee families to develop economic self-reliance. The agricultural land -- owned by King County, but not currently in use -- has been tilled; and the Hmong and Mien families are preparing the soil for planting.


The Project depends on the skills and resources of many volunteers and charitable organizations. Contributions are being sought for seed, fertilizer equipment and volunteer labor. Additionally, the Project is seeking monetary donations so that the Project can increase its staff. For more information, call 464-5820.


""It is my hope that the Indochinese Farm Project will mark a new beginning for refugee assistance, using public and private resources to help these refugees achieve economic independence,"" said Revelle. ""The final success of the Project will depend on what we do to help.

Melanie Sako is in the second year of a four-year apprenticeship to become an electrician. She says she enjoys ""the combination of technical skills and physical skills"" which her job requires.


Sako is one of 30 women apprentices in Local 46 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. There are also three women who have advanced to journeyperson.


Sako, who studied social work at the University of Washington for four years, said she decided she wanted to become an electrician ""because officetype work is so boring.""


""I can't sit down for long periods of time, and I didn't want to do something tedious,"" she said.


After attending the University, she worked one summer on a Forest Service fire crew in North Bend and found she enjoyed physical labor.


Shortly after that job, she answered a newspaper advertisement for women and minorities to enter the electrical trades.


Sako, noting that this June she will have completed two full years as an apprentice, said her position is classified as electrician apprentice-commercial wiring.


After she completes the four-year apprenticeship, she will attempt to pass a state test to get certified and become a journeyperson.


Sako works on high rise construction projects, ""running pipe and pulling wire, providing power for other people's use,"" she said. The work is dangerous, she added, because she often deals with high voltage. ""You have to develop a respect for what you're doing.""


The state of the economy affects the construction trade which in turn, affects the availability of work for electrical workers such as Sako. But she said that her job does pay well.


And she likes another aspect of her work: ""I can leave my work at the end of the day; I may feel physical fatigue, but I don't have to take any of the stress home with me. With an office job, it's a lot more draining because you're worrying about things even after work; there's greater mental fatigue.""

""Asian elected officials who met with Governor John Spellman last month to discuss a variety of concerns -- including affirmative action and bilingual education -- say the Governor was receptive and made several specific commitments.


Dolores Sibonga, Seattle City Council member, explained that Asian elected officials in Washington State got together near the end of 1981 to form the organization, Asian Elected Officials, which set as its first priority obtaining an appointment with the Governor. The group finally got its meeting with the Governor on August 31, holding a wide-ranging discussion that lasted about one hour.


Sibonga said that among the issues raised by the Asian officials were: the future of the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs, which a legislative auditor has said is not needed; the issue of redress for Japanese Americans; appointment of Asians to top posts in State agencies and for paid board and commission positions; funding for social and health services and bilingual education; and establishment of a liaison who would bring Asian concerns to the Governor's office.


Sibonga pointed out that there are no Asian State agency heads. And Spellman said it was unlikely that there would be any agency head openings in the next three months, she said.


Sibonga quoted Spellman as saving that he would try to establish a regular liaison for Asian concerns, possibly the State Commission on Asian American Affairs.


""Overall,"" Sibonga said, ""the Governor seemed to be informed and knew what we were talking about. He was sensitive to our concerns and he gave us a full hour; he didn't try to cut us off at the pass.""


Art Wang Democratic State legislator, said one major new commitment by Spellman was that he would make an executive request to the legislature for continuation of the Commission on Asian American Affairs. The statute which created the Commission expires June 30, 1983. Wang cautioned, however, that the battle to retain the Commission will be an uphill fight in the legislature, requiring community support.


Gene Matsusaka, Tacoma School Board member and another representative of Asian Elected Officials, said: ""Goverper Spellman seemed to listen, seemed knowledgeable, seemed receptive. But being a politician, he didn't make any commitments he wasn't going to keep. We'll have to hold his feet to the fire.""


Matsusaka, elected to the School Board last November, said Spellman told the group that bilingual education would ""very likely"" receive State funding as a line item rather than being lumped together with other special needs under one block grant. If there is a block grant, Matsusaka said, some local school boards give in to the temptation to reduce or eliminate funding for bilingual education.


Lalaine Wong, a member of the Auburn School Board since 1979 and another of those who attended the meeting with Spellman, said, however, that she remained skeptical Spellman would be able to do much to strengthen bilingual education funding. Bilingual education, she said, is a small portion of the special education needs, and the State legislature would probably balk at going along with the Governor.


Wong said she liked the idea of assigning the liaison role with the Governor's office to an Asian already working for the State so that there would not be ""a lot of budget hassle"" over creation of a new staff position.


Wong said that, even though State agency head positions are ""few and far between,"" there are many very qualified Asians who could be considered for those positions when openings appear. Wong distinguished between unpaid board and commission positions and ""$40,000 to $50,000 positions with access to the Governor and power in terms of budget decisions.""


Wong said Asian Elected Officials hopes to meet every several months with the Governor. She said she came away from the meeting feeling that Spellman ""really cared, and was really trying.""


""I hope, if nothing else, we awakened him to the unique needs we have as a community, that we are a large number of people, that we do count and that we need to have some kind of fegular access to express our needs,"" Wong said.

The Seattle Chinese Post and the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce last month hosted an economic development exhibit at the Imperial Palace Restaurant in the International District.


Thirty-seven businesses -- including restaurants, banks and stores -- sold products and displayed their services at the exhibit, and a panel of business persons spoke about how to improve the economy of the Seattle Chinatown-International District area.


The panel included architect Dennis Su, Chinatown Chamber of Commerce President Jesse Tam, and Kau Kau Restaurant owner Wai Eng. Panel members pointed out that, despite the depressed economy, business in Chinatown was generally doing better than in other parts of the city.


Assunta Ng, publisher of the Seattle Chinese Post, said one goal was to encourage development of the International District as a diversified commercial center -- with more than just restaurants and grocery stores. She commented that, within the last five years, the District has become more diversified, with new businesses such as a movie theatre, beauty shop and video store.


""We have here a city within a city and no one even realizes it,"" Ng commented. ""Not all Chinese, Japanese or Vietnamese live in the International District, so we wanted to bring together a variety of businesses to show what our community has to offer in terms of resources.""


Panelists talked about attracting greater numbers of white consumers to the International District, improving the availability of parking, increasing police security, and having more activities to draw people into the area.


One panel member pointed out that many of the ideas for improving the business climate of Chinatown have been discussed before, but that lack of influential leadership has hampered their implementation.


Among the businesses which had booths at the exhibit were: Mon Hei Chinese Bakery, King Lung Commodities, Silver Dragon Restaurant, Korea Ginseng Center, Wah Young Co., Total Protection Center and Kong Sun Co.

LA JOLLA, Calif. -- On the weekend of June 25 to 27, representatives from 20 Asian Pacific women's organizations from across the country gathered here to elect leadership, identify and discuss issues and strategies for a national network.


Billed as the First Biennial Convention of the National Network of Asian Pacific Women (NNAPW), the theme of the convention was ""Unity in Leadership.""


Speaker Odetta Fujimori, member of the National Education Association Executive Committee, suggested the appropriate image of the musubi (rice ball) for the convention. As individuals and singular organizations, we are but tiny grains of rice, she said, but when placed in hot water, we stick together.


The convention was attended by 20 organizations: Asian Women United, New York; New York Asian American Professional Women; New York Asian Pacific Women's Political Caucus; California Asian Pacific Women's Network; Central Valley Asian Pacific Women's Organization; Asian Pacific Women's Network, Los Angeles; Sacramento Asian Pacific Women's Network; Pacific and Asian American Women's Bay Area Coalition; Asian Pacific Women of San Diego County; Organization of Pan Asian Women of Washington D.C., National Island Women's Association, (NIWA), California; NIWA of Hawaii; NIWA of Los Angeles; Asian Sisters in Action, Boston; Asian Pacific Women's Network of Chicago; Hawaii Council of Asian Pacific Island Women; Samoan Women for Change; Famalao an; Tongan American Society of the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus of Washington State. The Tongan American Society was formed at the convention itself as the Tongan women united.


An Issue of Parity


In defining representation and leadership, convention representatives grappled with the fact that there were more Asians than Pacific Islanders and, therefore, it was important to ensure Pacific Islanders were included in all activities. Although it was important to unify, there needed to be acknowledgement of the cultural differences that imply differences in values, communication and leadership styles.


The planning committee foresaw these issues and attempted to address them by: allotting each organization 10 votes regardless of the size of the delegation; having an Asian co-chair and a Pacific Islander co-chair; assigning three positions on the board for Asians and three for Pacific Islanders, of which only one can come from each ethnic group; assuring geographical representation by having seven identified regions elect their own representatives. Asians will elect their own board representatives as will Pacific Islanders.


The intertwined issues of parity, self-determination and minority representation for Pacific Islanders became apparent when the election of co-chairs came up. The convention delegates adopted a recommendation that both Asian and Pacific Islander co-chairs be selected by the total body.


The Pacific Islanders tried to introduce the question of self-selection of leadership prior to adoption of the rules, but failed because it was not in the form of a motion prior to the motion to adopt the rules.


Later, more than two-thirds of the voting organizations agreed to reconsider the convention rules so that the issue of self-determination could be addressed on the floor. It is to the credit of the participants that the issue was addressed and given a full agenda.


The Pacific Islanders, in their gentle, firm way, repeatedly told the participants what they wanted. And when the convention agreed to approve self-selection of leadership, there was greater respect between the Asians and the Pacific Islanders based on a truer sense of trust. If the election method interferes with the goals of the network, it can be changed sometime in the future.


It was interesting to see the spectrum of communication styles within the convention, from women who held the veneer of white middle class professional manner to the seemingly laid-back soft, gentle style of the Pacific Islanders. They, certainly taught all of us a lesson in direct nonangry, firm communication.


Election Results


Irene Hirano of California was elected Asian co-chair while Pat Luce, also from California, was elected Pacific chair. In selecting the leadership, the 20 organizations holding 10 votes each and the one atlarge Asian delegate from Minnesota who had one vote considered the skills, track record and residence of the nominees.


The location for the next conference was considered as a factor in selecting the co-chairs. There was an assumption that the Pacific Islander co-chair would be selected from outside the continental United States. To our surprise, the Pacific Island co-chair was from California. Ms. Luce was selected by the Pacific Islander women who had caucused the night before the election. Hopefully, Asians, in the future, will also caucus in a similar way to decide on our Asian co-chair together. The Pacific Islanders also decided that three women -- Samoan, Hawaiian, Chamoro -- would support the Pacific Island chair and facilitate communications within each group. ""So instead of one Pacific Island co-chair, we are getting four Pacific Island chairs,"" according to Pat Brandt, former President of the Ad Hoc Committee to draft the bylaws of the network and plan this convention.


Interestingly, the Asians acted more in a regional mode rather than an ethnic specific or ""Asian mode."" It was ironic that the Pacific Islanders were asking the Asian sisters for organizational and bureaucratic technical assistance to bring about the unity and mutual support that they had already demonstrated.


Issues and Strategies


There were no surprises in this part of the convention proceedings. Using the 1980 Educational Equity Conference resolutions as a springboard for discussion, the various issues groups jelled in recognizing the impact of the two R's -- Reagan and Recession -- on the Asian Pacific community as well as other Third World communities.


Employment and refugee problems were identified as critical. Besides the usual information sharing and discussion about protecting established civil rights and lobbying strategies, the NNAPW board recommended the formation of political action committees in each region. The success of such activities will depend on the ability of these committees to establish and stay within clearly defined perimeters; otherwise they will defeat their own purpose by biting off more than they can chew.


The political action committees need to involve more than just Asian Pacific women; the issues addressed cover more than the concerns of Asian Pacific women. It is not just the same old tune played by a different instrument; it is a call to awaken sleeping dragons.

At the center of the workers' movement in the Philippines is Ernesto Arellano, a young lawyer who has been jailed and tortured by the Marcos government.


Arellano, whose eyeglasses and height hardly make him an imposing presence, talked about the plight of Filipino workers with authority and commitment when he was in Seattle recently. He is on a speaking tour of major cities in the United States, Canada and Europe, seeking international support for the struggle of seven million workers in the Philippines. Arellano is Secretary-General of the Kilusang Mayo Uno (May First Movement), the only confederation of labor unions to openly challenge the government's policies affecting labor.


The son of a farmer/carpenter, Ernesto was born in Naguilian, La Union, Philippines. A conservative religious upbringing prevented him from being engulfed by the strong current of the student protest movement during his student days in the 60's.


But it did not take long before he himself would eventually become one of the pillars of the workers' protest movement. while teaching Philippine and government history at the Baguio College Foundation in 1969, he saw the need to redirect the labor movement in the Philippines, ""to make the workers aware of the economic, social and political problems that have enslaved them for many long years.""


His involvement in the labor movement started in 1970 when he resigned from his teaching position to become the legal counsel of the Katipunan ng mga Samahan ng Manggagawa (Federation of Workers' Union), composed of 32 unions.


With the declaration of martial law in 1972, Ernesto was arrested on suspicion of being a Communist. He quips that in the Philippines ""if you walk like a duck, quack like a duck, then you are a duck."" His six-month stay in jail failed to stop him from politically educating the workers. A second arrest took place in 1979, followed by another in 1980 when he and his fellow organizers were planning a rally to protest the government's non-compliance with demands for a higher wage and restoration of the right to strike.


""The sufferings I endured while being tortured just made me become more determined and confirmed (my belief) that sacrifices are part of the struggle for freedom and justice,"" he said.


The Kilusang, Mayo Uno (KMU) is an alliance of six major labor federations and carries a membership of around 250,000 workers. ""The KMU was formed as a response to the harsh reality that the Philippine economy is up to now still dominated by foreign capital,"" he said. He goes on to say that ""the KMU has six basic demands: full restoration of the right to strike, abolition of the preventive suspension rule, increase of wages to an amount adequate to sustain a decent life for a family of six, expansion of the right to organize trade unions including public workers or employees of government-owned corporations; full guarantee of civil liberties, and nationalization of vital industries controlled and dominated by multi-national corporations.""


In contrast to the government-sponsored Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP), Ernesto describes the KMU ""as an emerging new political force in the Philippines."" His organization mobilized 25,000 workers during an indoor rally on May 1, 1980 and another 100,000 workers nationwide on May 1, 1981, despite obvious government intimidation. ""This growing militancy of the workers,"" he says. ""resulted in 131 strikes last year despite government's restrictions.""


A fearless critic of multi-national corporations in the Philippines, he condemns the growth of export processing zones, now totalling 12 nationwide, for their extremely low wages and inhuman working conditions that range from cramped boarding houses to violation of health and safety regulations. He also questions the rationale behind the incentives available to foreign investors that include among others full repatriation of profit and remittance of capital tax holidays for five years from start-up date accelerated depreciation, and duty-free import of raw materials and semi-processed goods for re-export. He deplores the wage of the Filipino workers being the lowest in all of Asia. He complains that an industrial worker in Metro, Manila is getting $4.13 a day for eight hours of work. He finds obnoxious the newlyenacted Batasang Pambansa 130 which empowers the labor minister and the president to declare illegal any strike in whatever industry for reason of ""national interests."" Lastly, he blasts the Marcos government for imposing too many restrictions before one can go on strike. ""All this,"" he says, ""creates a favorable climate for foreign investors.""


Despite the frequency with which labor activists are laid off, arrests and tortures and ""disappearances"" of some workers, Ernesto remains optimistic the KMU will increase its numbers and gain national prominence. An added feature to his optimism is the link that he wants to establish with progressive labor unions in the U.S.


That the KMU is being watched with rising anxiety by the threatened labor aristocracy in the Philippines is to be expected. ""It's all part of the struggle,"" Ernesto says. There is no doubt that he is aware of the consequences of casting his lot with seven million oppressed Filipino workers. But his conviction that workers are destined to write their own history has given him sufficient strength to overcome all kinds of difficulties, fear, and that human desire for comfort and convenience, Unsure of what will happen to him when he goes back to the Philippines, he can only say with a smile that conveys a deep sense of serenity. ""I will be where I can be effective.""

I was riding a Metro bus one afternoon when I overheard a white man in his 40's say to his female companion, ""Refugees really turn me off."" Without any hesitation, the lady replied. ""I don't know about you, but to me the refugees deserve the government's full support. They are, after all, the victims of a political decision in which the U.S. played a leading role.""


I thought the reply of the woman, who did not strike me as a political science student was pro-refugee, very profound and could lead to a better understanding why Indochinese refugees are in the U.S. This attitude, however, is very much the exception. A considerable number of people Asians and Americans alike continue to be ""haunted"" by the ever-growing refugee population in this country.


Why do refugees turn off some people? Is it because their presence lessens the chance of survival for many Americans who have to compete for decreasing dollars budgeted for social services? Is it because refugees take any kind of menial job compared to their American counterparts? Is it because they are alleged carriers of communicable diseases? Is it because several of them are successful businesspersons? Or is it because some of them are former soldiers and government officials who have acquired blood debts in their last-minute effort to thwart the resistance?


While it is a problem to make a distinction between what is true and what is false. I do not want to provide absolute guidelines in answer to the above questions. What is of utmost importance is the pressing question of why refugees exist.


Many people are so engrossed in the survival of the refugees -- which is a very valid concern -- that in the ensuing confusion caused by the federal cuts, there are certain political realities people either forget or ignore.


People are essentially the product of their own society. Our ideas, attitudes, beliefs and mores are usually a reflection of the economic forces that shape our society. Unavoidably, in this society there are contradictions, contradictions between the farmers and the landowners, between factory workers and factory owners, between the ruled and the ruling. In simple words, ours is a society that is formed by irreconcilable class interests. The clash of such interests, which is sometimes bloody on both sides, often times results in the displacement of people. A good example are the . . .


It appears then . . . the refugee problem is not just a matte of cutting off public assistance after 18 months. It certainly is more complicated than this. While supporting the refugees is the primary obligation of the country that is politically responsible for their predicaments, the refugee crisis is more than a human and sociological problem. The refugee is a product of political and economic machinations that the big powers are making to divide the world resources.


Whether the refugees like it or not, they will always have to face the difficulty of living in a strange land, with a totally different culture. A little knowledge of the English language will give a little convenience, but it will not cure mental and psychological scars their situation has inflicted on them. As they are all aware, the problem does not end with finding a country in which to stay. Wherever they are, as long as they continue to remain uprooted from their homeland, they will always have to live each day unsure of what the future holds.


Whenever I hear some refugees talk about their pain, sufferings, fears, anguish insecurity and apprehension, my heart literally bleeds for them. But their problems do more than touch my heart. They make me realize that theirs is a problem that is bound to repeat history as long as the ruling few entrenched by foreign capital continue to threaten the interests of the many. And the paradox is no one can turn their back on the social interests of the many and still find themselves undisturbed and living in contentment.


In the end, the refugee problem, is not the problem of the refugees alone. It is the problem of humanity.

The Chinese Community Public Affairs Organization (CCPAO), which is hosting a candidates forum in the International District this Wednesday, seeks to ""increase the political awareness of Chinese so that they are better able to vote intelligently, one of the organization's founders said in an interview earlier this month.


Karen Gail Chinn Wong, criminal defense attorney for the Associated Counsel for the Accused and president of CCPAO, was one of three individuals who formed CCPAO in June, 1980. Wong, Boeing engineer Art Lum, and dentist Dr. Roy Mar launched the organization, which is governed by a seven-member board, to promote community participation in the political process.


Wong, long-time activist in Seattle's Chinese community, said CCPAO last month began a membership drive which will broaden CCPAO's base of representation. CCPAO currently has about 20 members.


""In the past, Chinese people have been more concerned with their own families and making a living and haven't shown the interest in becoming as politically involved as the Japanese have,"" Wong said.


CCPAO, which is seeking to incorporate as a non-profit organization, invites the participation of Democrats. Republicans and Independents and has encouraged voter registration, Wong said.


CCPAO's first project was a candidates forum in October, 1980, which attracted 250 people who heard a variety of candidates running for major legislative seats, including U.S. Senator Slade Gorton, U.S. Representative Mike Lowry, Governor John Spellman and State Attorney General Ken Eikenberry. Since that forum, CCPAO has maintained contact with Gorton, Eikenberry and Spellman, Wong said.


Direct ties with elected officials are important, Wong said, when issues affecting the Chinese community come up such as proposed immigration law changes which would prevent reunification of families.


In March, 1981, CCPAO held a Chinese New Year dinner to honor newly-elected Governor John Spellman.


And this Wednesday, October 20, CCPAO will hold a candidates night forum at the Imperial Palace Restaurant at 609 South Weller in the International District. A no-host cocktail hour will begin at 5:30 p.m., dinner at 6:30 and the forum at 7:30. Forum organizers hope to have major candidates for the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House races there.


Another major CCPAO project, according to Wong, is to ""compile a list of all the Chinese families that live in King County and find out which precincts have a concentration of Chinese so that elected officials are aware of their potential impact."" An initial list of Chinese was derived from Chinese organizations, Wong said, and CCPAO will go to other sources such as the phone book, voter lists and possibly the Census Bureau for additional names: The names will be consolidated into a computer list, she said CCPAO is looking for volunteers, particularly students, to help on the project.


Last month, CCPAO also put out the first issue of a regular newsletter to acquaint potential voters with the organization, key political races in King County and other ballot measures.


Other CCPAO officers include: Secretary, Conrad Lee, engineer for the City of Seattle, and Treasurer, H.F. Lee, engineer at Boeing.

James Wong Howe: Cinematographer by Todd Rainsberger (A.S. Barnes & Co.)


He's six years old and the only one in class. The year is 1905 in the railroad town of Pasco, Washington. The other kids yank on his queue. He fights a lot. The only ones who play with him are Indians and they wonder what tribe he's from. His first attempts at photography are a disaster. On the first roll, he develops the paper and throws away the negative. On the second roll, taking pictures of his family, he framed their heads out of the picture, which displeases his family very much. So began the inauspicious debut of one of our country's greatest cinematographers, James Wong Howe.


Ironically, most Asians in the acting profession today, to survive, play exotic slant-eyed beauties or bowing karateslashing maniacs, somehow hoping they'll be able to balance it out acting in their own theatre productions in the community. Yet for over fifty years the way we looked at Hollywood movies was shaped by a Chinese American eye. The role of cinematographer is a powerful position in the making of a film. A concept Howe well understood.


Rainsberger's book presents a detailed analysis of the life and art of one of the industry's most seminal voices. Covering his major films in terms of cinematic development, often scene by scene and frame by frame, the effect is not unlike getting a close look through the eye of a camera by peering over the shoulder of the artist himself. After a brief biography, the author divides the book into sections detailing the history of cinematography and the role Howe played in its growth. Beginning with a definition of the function of the camera-person, it covers Howe's style in practice and theory, the years at different studios and his final refinements in black-and-white and color. Along the way, there are interviews with his crew and colleagues and over eight directors for whom he worked as well as his own commentary. The author is careful to write in a clear, comprehensive style, for the general reader as well as for those in the profession.


Howe was a perfectionist completely dedicated to his work and strongly independent. This uncompromising attitude made him hard to work with, but more often than not produced quality results. There were few in the industry who did not gain respect for his integrity.


""When I start a show, I let the crew know I'm boss. I'm boss because if something goes wrong in my department. I'll get the blame; therefore, I want it to be my mistake. If I want a lamp moved over just a couple of inches and the guy in the loft thinks I'm being arty and won't move it. I'll yell at him to get the hell down and punch out; I don't want him on my set. The word had always been around that 'That Chinaman's tough to work for, but if you do what he says he'll treat you right.'""


This attitude of defiance carried him through the racism he was to face his entire life as a yellow man in a white industry. ""I always felt that I was more Chinese than American...not being allowed to become naturalized until after the Second World War, I felt I was more or less a guest. Every year in January I had to fill out an immigration card. When I became a citizen. I felt proud and happy -- I belonged. I feel Chinese. I'm a citizen but I'm not Caucasian."" When he first came to Hollywood, he was often given the worst equipment to work with and many of the crew under him resented his presence. Director Howard Hawks recalls, ""A lot of people in the crew resented taking orders from 'a little Chinaman.'"" Howe's early experience as a boxer often served him well on many occasions.


At one time he wanted to film the great novel ""Rickshaw Boy,"" a scathing satire of moral decay in modern China and a story of San Francisco's Chinatown. Many felt he was a frustrated director behind a camera. Unfortunately, his plans never worked out, and this was his greatest disappointment. Nonetheless, his lens benefited others' films as diverse as Yankee Doodle Dandy, Picnic, Sweet Smell of Success, The Rose Tattoo, The Old Man and the Sea, Hud, and The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.


When we view a film, we often take the image for granted, forgetting the cinematographer's attention to depth, composition, light quality, shutter speed, lens, angle, and thousands of other details that go into framing a single shot.


""Howe felt he had to 'involve' the audience in the action: 'Words you might forget, but you never forget the images...I want you to feel it. But at the same time, the audience should not be aware that they are being manipulated by lights cameras and the rest of the film mechanics. Howe insisted that the mechanics be invisible; 'We just happen to see what happens,' he says.""


A striking example can be seen in Body and Soul (1947), the story of the corruption of a boxer, portrayed by John Garfield. Prior to this film, most fights were shot by an immobile dolly in the ring which could only go up and down and sideways. ""I want something so that when Garfield gets hit and falls I can follow him and turn the camera and suddenly leave his face and see nothing but hot light flashing down on his face -- just as the fighter would -- and then you cut to the face and the eyes are closed.... you can see the excitement in that ""Using two lightweight camer as held in his hands and walking around the ring. Howe hoped to achieve the most accurate effects. Even this did not permit him enough freedom of movement, so he strapped on roller skates and became a human dolly. A grip was used to push him around the ring. The effects are as close to being in the ring yourself as possible. You stagger and wince and go out of focus with every punch.


Witness the author's analysis of scenes from yet another film. The Rose Tattoo the Tennessee Williams play starring Burt Lancaster and Anna Magnani which won Howe an Oscar in 1955.


""The scenes in the house immediately following the death are all very dark with very heavy shadows enveloping the walls and furniture Nothing of beauty is allowed in the interior shots. The compositions are tight and often unbalanced and dark foreground objects make the house seem claustrophobic Occasionally light gleams through the slits in the shutters cutting the room with harsh rays that strike a slovenly Magnant at her sewing machine.


After she hears her husband had a lover she prays before a statue of Christ the icon is lit by a ray of light. The camera, from above peers down sympathetically on Magnant as she kneels Her face is lighted but she is surrounded by deep shadows and dark furniture. The high angle isolates, her in a black void a pitiable figure indeed. The shot is one of the few photographic excesses of the film but conveys her condition so powerfully that it seems essential to the drama.


Howe's last film was Funny Lady (1974), in which he was called in to replace another cameraman. He was in poor health and collapsed on the set, but managed to finish the film. For this he received his tenth academy award nomination. At a party celebrating the completion Howe told an old friend why he risked his health on the picture. ""In calm matter-of-fact tones. Howe replied that he knew he was dying and I just wanted to go out with my boots on. Then he winked and said. 'When do we start on the next one?'""


Howe was not only a pioneer in the role of the camera, he was a pioneer for his people as well. As he often said, ""It's not what you see, it's what I suggest you see. If I were partially blind. I could ask for no more reliable a guide than James Wong Howe. After reading this book, you'll never look at a movie in the same way and you'll be far richer for it.

With the unanimous approval of the City Council and Mayor Charles Royer, the name of the street which has been Known for years as ""Empire Way,"" has been changed to ""Martin Luther King Way in honor of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and civil rights leader. And some people are upser.


What's in a name? Plenty. There are angry people notably the Empire Way Merchants Association. which has brought a lawsuit over the name change Others see the Council's action to rename the street as wasteful spending since it will cost on estimated $141,000 to change the street signs. Some criticize the Council's action as a political move to appease the black community. And of course, there are those who don't want anything named after a ""nigger,"" no matter how great. educated, or humane that person might have been. You might call it, ""the Empire strikes back.""


At a time when unemployment is high and money is tight, it does look on the surface, like the Council's decision to change the street name and the accompanying costs of doing so are ill-timed. You can't eat street signs, But taking things in perspective the money allocated for the name change will keep some folks employed. After all, someone has to paint and someone has to install those street signs. And $141,000 is a drop in the bucket when you consider that the City spends millions of dollars on public improvements.


Some who don't support the name change claim that their motive is not racial that they have nothing against Dr. King. Their claim is that the name change will cost them money because of the costs. of changing their business signs and stationery. Good point? Not really. So use the old stationery until it runs out and change it when you reorder And write off the business signs on your income taxes as a business expense. It does seem hypocritical that businessmen complaining about the financial burden caused by the name change have money to hire a lawyer to make a legal challenge rather than spending it on the signs and stationery.


One suggested alternative is to rename something already named ""King"" after the civil rights leader. There is King Street, which runs through the heart of the International District. There is the King Street Railroad Station. And the Kingdome. And, of course, King County. All these ""Kings"" were named after the same man, William R. King. Who? William Refus Devane King was elected Vice-President in 1853, but died before his inauguration. And he owned slaves in Selma, Alabama. How's that for irony? We live in a county named after a slaveowner. We live in a state named after George Washington, also a slaveowner.


I think those of us in the International District would be proud if our King Street were named after Martin Luther King. After all, we do have an intersection called Maynard and Jackson, which is, of course, the first and last names of a former mayor of Atlanta. But somehow, renaming King Street after Dr. King doesn't seem appropriate. It would be like honoring Bruce Lee with a statue and placing it at 26th and Cherty. The name just wouldn't go with the territory. And King Street, unlike Empire Way, is really just a side street. Empire Way is a thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the City.


I honestly can't understand why the renaming of a street has become a public controversy. The lawsuit filed to block the name change is based on a claim that the Seattle voters should have been the ones, rather than the City Council, to make a decision on the street change, There are literally hundreds of streets in Seattle. It borders on the ridiculous to argue that voters should be involved in a street naming decision. In recent years, Bothell Way has been changed to Lake City Way, Northeast 110th has been changed to Northgate Way, and Connecticut Street was changed to Royal Brougham Way. There were no court challenges then.


Are you a racist if you don't support the name change? I personally think that the money spent on the name change could be used for programs which have more benefit to the people like housing, education, or social services. And I think that the memory of Dr. King deserves more than a street named after him. I can think of better ways to honor Martin Luther King like a youth program, a scholarship, a cultural center, or some civil rights related activity. We already have a school named after him. But I'm not opposed to the name change; I'm just not excited about it.


Isn't it ironic that the name of a man who sought to bring people together should create an issue that drives people apart? Unfortunately, the name change brings out the racists. Whatever merit the Empire Way Merchants Association has in mounting objections to the name change will be clouded with racist undertones.


Did the City Council change the name to Martin Luther King Way to appease the black community? Perhaps. I think it would be kind of difficult for a politician to vote against the memory of Martin Luther King without looking like a racist. But if all it takes to quiet any minority community is to name a street after a minority person, then we would have had a Bob Santos Boulevard or a Roberto Maestas Drive years ago. Renaming a street after a black person won't satisfy anybody's affirmative action program.


Martin Luther King Way is just a street Wait until the racists out there realize that Seattle, our beloved city, was named after an American Indian. I can see it now, They'll be circulating a petition to change the name to honor some famous white person. They'd change Seattle to something like ""Smithville,"" or better still ""Jonestown.""

The seventh annual Chinatown-International District Summer Festival, Seattle's largest Asian community street fair, will be held Sunday, August 1 at Hing Hay Park (corner of Maynard Ave. and So. King).


The Summer Festival, an official Seafair event, blends a variety of Asian foods such as somen, lumpia, cha-siu, kori, wonton, and yaki soba, as well as arts and crafts, entertainment, cultural demonstrations and children's activities in this day of celebration and sharing of cultures. Booths and activities will run from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. All the day's festivities will be topped off with a parade down Jackson St. starting at 7 p.m.


There's something for everyone at the Festival. Whether it's children's games or art demonstrations, wu shu (Chinese martial arts) or taiko (Japanese drums), Vietnamese finger foods or Laotian needle work, or Polynesian dancers, the Summer Festival is the place to find it!


This event is sponsored by the International District Economic Association and the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Additional support was provided by the Seattle Arts Commission and Pacific Northwest Bell.

Every first Tuesday of the month at 5:30 p.m., a small group of Asian/Pacific women casually converse over teriyaki at Tenkatsu. At 6:30, the small group joins a few more Asian/Pacific women at the Bush Asia Center. The conversation flows easily into a meeting and the topics become somber.


The Asian/Pacific Women's Caucus grapples with issues ranging from affirmative action to nuclear war, from stereotypical dolls to bilingual education. Children are often present at meetings. Action is discussed and voted on. Members volunteer to carry out the wishes of the group.


Roughly six years ago, a few Asian/Pacific women set the groundwork for an activist community group addressing racism and sexism. Many of the faces have changed, but the commitment remains; the Caucus style is shaped by its unflagging members.


When we began this column several months ago, we wanted a medium to communicate with the rest of our community. We felt it important not only to let others know of our issues and work, but to provide a forum for Asian/Pacific women to share their knowledge and views. This time, we want to report some of our activities. Names will be mentioned because we truly believe the Caucus is greater than the sum of its parts; its parts are dynamite.


Politically, we are persistent in informing government officials of our views, Recently, we invited Seattle Office of Women's Rights (OWR) Director Donna Stringer-Moore to our meeting. In the past, we had been disappointed in her office's absence in our community. As a result of our meeting, an employment rights brochure is being developed under OWR's auspices. That office will be responsible for securing funding to publish the brochure in five Asian languages. Maria Batayola assisted in the initial development. Yuri Takahashi and Evelyn Iritani are reviewing the contents.


We closely monitor developments on the city county state, and to a certain extent, the national levels of government. We are active in writing letters of support and concern about service and budget funding and cutbacks of agencies serving our community. We are especially active on issues of affirmative action and minority business enterprise.


Ticiang Diangson led our efforts against former County Executive Ron Dunlap's attempt to water down the Minority/Women Business Ordinance. And through Maria we participated in the development of a stronger ordinance under County Executive Randy Revelle. We firmly informed Mayor Charles Royer of our disappointment when salary cutbacks in his office affected women only.


Though the Caucus does not endorse candidates, we continue to co-sponsor candidate forums and the resulting victory celebrations with the Asian Americans for Political Action (AAPA).


In education, we supported parents and students in a lawsuit against the elimination of bilingual education and the attempt to include bilingual education as part of basic instruction. Along with AAPA and the Washington Association for Asian and Pacific Education, we conducted a mass community meeting with Seattle School District Superintendent Don Steele.


Culturally through Martha Chose's efforts, we co-sponsored ""Breaking Out,"" the first production brought here by a regional Asian arts consortium.


The Caucus is more than a local organization. Our presence has been felt nationally. Three years ago, we were recipients of a grant from the Department of Labor to conduct a workshop on the employment needs of Asian Pacific women. The grant connected the Caucus to a national network of Asian Pacific women. That network formally convened its first national conference and the Caucus is a founding organization. We sent three delegates to the organizing conference -- Maria, a member of the national planning committee, Joan Yoshitomi and Vicki Woo. The Caucus is the only Asian/Pacific women's group representing the Northwest. With the network, we are now linked with national policy developments and actions.


Internationally, our members met some of the survivors of the H bomb from Japan. They came to the U.S. to join the international demonstration for peace last month. Yuri organized a luncheon to share our experience as women and as Asians in two distinct societies.


We will continue our Jobbying and advocacy efforts. However, we have also become aware that we need to nurture and educate ourselves. This fall. we are embarking on an ambitious community education series. Shirley Shimada, Evelyn Iritani, Yuri and Maria have planned a year-long schedule of workshops.


Leading off in September will be an Employment. Skills Building mini-series November will bring a session on political savvy. Stress reduction, a cooking demonstration and a party are on the board for December, The topper will be a series in the spring. ""How to be Powerful and Still be Asian."" The entire schedule will be open to the general community with a minimal fee for non-Caucus members.


Strokes should also be extended to members of the Executive Committee. Sally Kazama, co-chair, is busy organizing standing committees that will formalize some of the Caucus responsibilities Martha Choe, treasurer; has made sense of the Caucus books (it took a banker to do it) and she will head fundraising efforts. Kudos should be extended to Nancy Lim and Elaine Ko co-secretaries Nancy developed the newsletter format and now that she is off to Yale Elaine will continue as the sole secretary.


Last but not least we truly thank Jane Yambe for her continuing work coordinating the columns which appear in this newspaper.


As a purely volunteer organization, the Caucus is dependent on its members. Dues are $10.00 a year and we undertake occasional fundraising efforts to support our work. At the International District Street Fair, we sponsored an herbal ice tea booth and a feminist fortune-telling booth coordinated by Martha and Ticiang.


We behave that we have established a growing, viable network of Asian Pacific women and increasingly, men encompassing all ages. Asian/Pacific groups, and occupations. We use the system to make changes or at the very least voice our opinion. What we have written about is only an indication of what we do The work continues. Join us.


Teresita I Batayola is the current cochair of the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus.

When Kumi Kilburn became Manager of Corporate Contributions for Rainier Bank three years ago, she felt it was ""uncanny"" that her new job would combine so many things she enjoyed doing.


The job, she said, ""combined my interests in accounting, writing, interacting with senior management and also allowing me to keep my sense of community. And every part of my job I enjoy. Not each part exclusively, but all the parts together.""


Her position as Manager of Corporate Contributions requires her ""to be aware of local and state policy as they affect the banks and to also develop guidelines for those business contributions. She is currently revising the guidelines, which requires her to confer with bank committee members, other banks and outside resources to get an accurate forecast of how Rainier Bank can best serve its community.


""I am helping a major corporation to make a link with the community,"" said Kilburn, who is also an Assistant, Vice President of the Bank. ""I have an interest in improving our community, in short-term and long-term impacts. I am always looking for solutions to influence others in a positive way.""


Born in Korea, Kilburn lived in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and then came to the United States to attend school when she was 19. She has lived here for 25 years. And she is also the niece of noted local photographer Johsel Namkung.


""My father, a physician, looked at the world and decided that he wanted his children to become citizens of the world,"" Kilburn says, explaining why she has lived in so many countries before attending college in the U.S. She, at one time, could speak Korean, Shanghai dialect, Cantonese and Japanese, but now mainly uses English.


She attended Pratt Institute, University of Washington, Columbia University and Antioch University, where she received her degree in Public Policy in 1978. She was 41 when she graduated.


""When I did volunteer work as a housewife, I didn't get any consideration,"" Kilburn said. ""People would call at 7 a.m. or 11:30 p.m. So now, there is more form to my life and I enjoy that a lot.


""It's not easy having a career and children -- four sons, 13 to 21 -- and maintaining outside interests. But because of my age, I've been able to be a full-time home-maker, volunteer and career woman. I feel I've had my cake and eaten it, too.""


Kilburn meets people in all areas of interest in screening organizations which will receive contributions from Rainier Bank. She evaluates requests and sometimes conducts on-site visits to find out as much about the groups as possible before making a recommendation to the senior officers of the Bank, who make the final decisions.


It takes about six weeks to evaluate a request. Last year, the Bank received over 600 applications for money and 250 contributions were made, of which United Way is the largest. The department's budget for 1982 is $900,000.


Before taking the job at Rainier Bank, Kilburn spent much of her time on the Lake Washington School Board, the state and national school boards, the Bellevue Community College Women's Center Advisory Board and the Kirkland Redmond Boys and Girls Clubs.


""I'm attracted to groups that educate youths rather than social service,"" she said.


But that doesn't conflict with her job, where she must deal with all types of organizations -- large universities and small social service agencies.


""I happen to really believe in Rainier Bank policies,"" Kilburn said. ""But we have to be careful in which areas and where we can make a difference. Each company has a unique focus in relation to how they make their profits, so most of our interests lie in housing employment and business education.


""The private citizens are affected by these policies, more than we think, she said. ""In Reagan's New Federalism, we (corporations) are being asked to pick up the pieces that the federal government is dropping.


But Kilburn doesn't find that necessarily discouraging, as she said she enjoys learning more and more from her job and from helping the community. She remembers laughing when she got this job though, because it was something she didn't imaging when setting her career goals. But it has turned out to be a perfect fit.


""As long as I feel I can be stimulated and challenged by my job, be rewarded for it, and continue to have personal growth. I'll be happy in my position,"" Kilburn said. ""I want to do my job better and better to impact more persons in the community.""

A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) detailing proposals for completion of a traffic interchange linking Interstate 90 and Interstate 5 to City streets does not adequately consider potential traffic congestion problems in the International District, representatives from three District organizations testified last week.


The Washington State Department of Transportation held a public hearing at the Nippon Kan Theatre to receive comments on the Department's proposals for completion of the Connecticut Street Interchange at the junction of I-90 and I-5, which is south of the International District.


The project would connect transit, carpool and general purpose lanes at the western end of I-90 to transit facilities and City streets serving downtown Seattle, the Duwamish industrial area, the Kingdome and the Seattle waterfront.


General purpose lanes would be extended from ramps and bridges in the Connecticut Street Interchange to a touchdown point near Fourth Avenue South. Exclusive transit lanes would be extended from Corwin Place and South Dearborn Street to the south end of the Central Business District.


Bob Santos, director of the International District Improvement Association (Inter Im), said the District has historically been moved disrupted and divided in the name of better transportation."" The DEIS, he said, fails to adequately consider the joint impact of the I-90 project and Metro's plans for a south transit terminal.


DEIS projections of street traffic in and around the International District are lower than those presented in a 1979 Metro report, Santos said. ""Since we believe the traffic study failed to account for the actual volume of traffic, it follows that the noise and air quality studies are also deficient,"" he said.


The I-90 project and Metro's south terminal will ""compound"" the existing parking problem in the District, an impact omitted from the DEIS, Santos said.


Santos called for the Transportation Department to study an alternative plan, proposed by Inter Im, which would bring transit traffic from I-90 and I-5 to Metro's Ryerson base site. Inter Im's plan would require less property acquisition and would, therefore, be less costly, he said.


Mark Della, vice-president of the International District Emergency Center, said the DEIS should include a ""study of traffic when it is backed up due to accidents, Kingdome events, Seafair time, or other situations where major congestion might occur.""


""We would like a system developed which would regulate the impact of this erratic flow on the International District,"" Della said.


Della also expressed concern over the effect of increased noise and air pollution on the District ""and our youth, who often play within a quarter block of I-5.""


Elaine M. Ko, representing the International District Housing Alliance, said her organization is concerned about the cumulative impact of the I-90 and Metro terminal plans on low-income residents and small businesses in the District, an impact not fully measured because studies do not take account of both projects together. Technical studies, she said, also do not describe the effect of such projects on ""the quality of human life in the community.""


Jerry Zirkle, district administrator for the Transportation Department, said the final draft EIS will be prepared either near the end of this year or early next year, and adopted in mid-1983. The final EIS would be issued in late 1983. Right-of-way acquisition would begin in late 1983 or in 1984, and construction would start in 1985.

My mother was mugged in front of our house while we were playing Scrabble inside. We thought she was shooing away the neighborhood dogs, but she was saying, no no, no to the purse snatcher. When it dawned on me to go outside and check, it was too late. I told my sister to call the police. She called 911 and gave the operator our address.I told my sister that mother's purse had been stolen and she communicated that to the 911 operator. The police arrived within two to three minutes.


The officer who responded was very nice and helpful. She said that there have been many purse snatchings in the area and that they had a suspect whom they had not been able to nab A canine unit was brought in to try to track the purse snatcher.


Right away I thought of a letter in the Beacon Hill News written by an Asian woman, also the victim of a purse snatcher, warning that there was a purse snatcher in the area who preyed on Asian women.


Now I don't know if this was the same purse snatcher who robbed my mother; my mother did not get a good look at her assailant. What I do know is that many Chinese victims, unable to speak English, do not contact the police, or if they do, they wait until it's too late to do anything. The day after the incident, my mother's friends came to visit. Many of them had similar stories to tell. That made me even more upset.


Earlier this year, a woman was robbed of her purse at a bus stop. She waited until she got to work to report the crime. Since then, she has seen the purse snatcher at the bus stop -- more than once -- but she doesn't want to tell the police. She is afraid of retaliation. She doesn't want to get involved. She says there are other victims of this particular purse snatcher who can identify him but won't.


My mother's friends remember a woman who, a few years ago, identified her robber only to be killed by him when he was released from jail. The fear of retaliation is valid.


There was an incident near the International District in which a group of men approached three elderly Chinese ladies. The ladies did not carry purses, but the men, believing the ladies were carrying money, made them disrobe in the cold of the winter and search them. The ladies did not report the crime to the police.


Just about an hour before my mother was robbed, a family across the street had discovered the windows of their car smashed. The car windows were broken within two hours prior to discovery, since that was when the car was last used. They did not report the crime until they saw the police looking around for my mother's assailant.


While reporting a crime may not always lead to the apprehension of the criminal, it will alert the police to the problem in the neighborhood and this could mean increased patrol of the neighborhood. Reporting the crime to the police will unlikely result in adverse consequences to the victim.


The police are available to help people, but they can't unless they are notified. Granted, there is a language barrier for many non-English-speaking persons, but these people must be encouraged to call the police. There are bilingual 911 operators. Non-English speakers should be encouraged to call those who are bilingual and can call the police for them.


Ignoring the criminal element will not make it go away. Victims of crimes should report the incidents to the police immediately. Persons should also call the police when they see something suspicious. The police can help, but only if people let them.

For My Mother


Balancing on Oriental spike heels,


these three Zhou daughters squint


from the Kodak print, their silk


dresses shaping their bodies


with cloth hips and cardboard collars.


They lean forward, maybe to talk


or stay upright. Gold gypsy beads


plastic roses and pearl brooches


draw down their flat bosoms, line


their necks and sun-stroked arms.


Serious in their dressed-up beauty,


they are unaware that the silk dyes


and embroidery do not mix with


the Kansas browns of the lawn,


or the wood A-frames of houses


in construction behind them. Slippered.


Carolyn smiles through zippered brows,


her blue silk skirt puddled


around her ankles like cast off clothes.


She cannot be taller than four feet.


Daiyan holds her coral skirt out


like bat wings, chest puffed out,


a belt hula-hooped around her American


jumper. Hands taped flat on her thighs


to show off the ten cent rings


on each finger, Sonya stands with her toes


pointing inward. Her earrings do not


match: one springs outward, a locked


pendulum, while the other droops


like the water of a sprinkler behind them.


There are patches of green, a calico


of browns, tans and leaf. In this


tapestry, a boy bikes pass with a Federal


Way News bag on his shoulder.


He turns to watch this parade of gypsies.

(Through Harsh Winters: The Life of a Japanese Immigrant Woman by Akemi Kikumura. Chandler and Sharp Publishers. Inc., 1981).


Through Harsh Winters is an Issei woman's life told to her youngest daughter, the author. The story recounts her childhood in Japan, her marriage and voyage to America, raising children and working on farms in California, the war years, and growing old.


The book is more than an oral history of one woman. With perception and sensitivity, the author details the struggles of Issei women in coping with Japanese tradition in a foreign country, and how this tradition evolves and continues through the family.


Michiko Tanaka was born in Hiroshima of a good family. Michiko's sole reason for marrying her husband was to come to the United States. Her dream was to see this strange country, and she persuaded him to make the trip.


After they arrived in the United States, Michiko's life was one of constant toil. She and her husband worked as farmers, she as a cook for farm laborers. They had 13 children, two of whom died, leaving one son and 10 daughters. Saburo, her husband, was a compulsive gambler; they never saved anything and often had trouble feeding the family.


Kikumura, Michiko's youngest daughter is an anthropologist from UCLA and has published other studies of Japanese American families. In this book, she presents her mother's story as told to her through 288 hours of interviews. Kikumura also interviewed her siblings and her mother's relatives in Japan. The result is a telling portrayal of an Issei woman and a revealing study of the generation gap between the Issei and Nisei.


Michiko's most striking trait is her stoicism; despite her husband's destructive gambling, her sons deaths, and perpetual work, Michiko carries on Divorce is unthinkable; as long as her husband provides for her children, she is content.


For woman the main thing is to take care of her husband and to raise the children, Michike says. ""This is where a woman finds her fulfillment. No matter how independent she may be, she must depend on her man because he is the main breadwinner.""


The importance of the family and the woman's role in serving the family become a point of conflict between Michiko and her daughters. Because two of her daughters were divorced, Michiko felt she had failed her children. But in the sisters' interviews, one can see how their upbringing influenced their decisions.


Saburo was a very strict father, demanding silence and absolute respect. He instilled in his children a great sense of pride in being Japanese. They were taught traditional Japanese manners; they were also urged to be aggressive and superior to succeed in white society. Therefore, the Nisei had to be two people -- one person in Japanese American society and another person in white society.


Michiko taught her daughters to be traditional Japanese women -- to respect their husbands and serve their children. Perhaps because of her own marriage, she also taught them to disrespect men in general. Men were weak and like children, a woman had to be independent and learn how to succeed on her own. Michiko's daughters grew up with conflicting attributes; they were very capable, intelligent and self-assured, but tended to be self-sacrificing and passive. The break-up of their marriages was, in some sense a growing, breaking-out experience for them; however; Michiko saw the divorces as proof of their failure as women and her failure as a mother.


This is one example of the special problems encountered by Japanese American families. Kikumura recounts the evolution of Japanese culture in America throughout the book; how Issei maintained the Japanese community through churches and Japanese associations, the relaxed pressures of obligation to parents in Japan, the decline of primogeniture (rule of eldest son) in favor of equal inheritance and obligation in Nisei and Sansei. The appendices provide an educational mini-course of the Japanese American family. They include: an account of the Tokugawa-early Meiji era in Japan from which the Issei came; a concise history of Japanese America; a review of literature on the Japanese American family; and the methodology for the study.


Kikumura wants to promote a greater understanding of Asians in America through her work. She has chosen cultural continuity and change in Japanese Americans as her area of research. This book, her fourth publication, is an excellent choice for an anthropology student interested in Asians or other minorities in America. It is short entertaining, well-written and scholarly.


But for Japanese Americans, it is a look into a mirror without our daily masks, seen with the detachment of an outsider, but with strangely familiar images. It is one of the best books I have read about where we have come from and if it doesn't tell us exactly where we are going, at least we can better understand the who and why of Japanese American today.

The International District Community Health Center last month expanded its facilities into the Bush-Asia Center, opening an annex office with services in family planning nutrition counseling, health education and obstetrics.


The 800-square-foot Health Center annex located on the park level of the Bush-Asia Center is dedicated to the late Dr. Henry Luke an active community physician.


Besides providing health care services, the new office has an elderly project which offers foot care sessions twice a week and a medication review during which patients are informed on the use and dosage of medications. Additionally, the Health Center annex distributes food vouchers for milk and other foods, particularly for infants. This supplemental food program is for mothers and infants.


""We outgrew our space and need the room."" Gail Tanaka, director of the ID Health Center, said. ""The foot care and medication review are convenient at the Bush since the meal program for the elderly is next door in the assembly room.""


The original office of the Health Center, at 416 Maynard South, provides care for about 1000 patients each month. The Center has about 6000 regular patients. ""Using the Bush facility will allow us to see more patients and will ease the crowding situation,"" said Tanaka.


Although the Health Center is expanding, the number of staff will remain the same. Some of the 22 full-time and 10 part-time staff and volunteers who operate the Health Center will spend part of their time at the Bush office. The staff's ability to communicate in 13 languages helps them to be sensitive to cultural differences in health care.


""We treat all general medical problems for all age groups,"" commented Tanaka. However, children and the elderly comprise a greater portion of the patients. The Health Center also refers patients to the Public Health Hospital for specialists and hospitalization.


According to Tanaka, the idea for the expansion came about when the Bush project first got started. She said, ""There was pressure on us to expand. . .It's pretty exciting to expand our space and our services.""

May 6 marks the 100 anniversary of the Asian Exclusion Act, first enacted against the Chinese in 1882. Because of the act, immigration of Chinese was suspended for 10 years, illegal immigrants were deported, and Chinese could not become American citizens.


It was the first piece of legislation to deny immigration on the basis of race. Soon thereafter, Chinese all over the West were attacked, driven out and killed. Whole Chinatowns became ghosttowns. Almost 30 Chinese lost their lives in the infamous Rock Springs massacre.


It was as if all the contributions of the Chinese towards the building of this country meant nothing and the very men who risked their lives to build railroads, reclaim swamplands and settle the West were suddenly dispensable.


This was only the beginning of laws enacted against a people simply because of their ethnic background. In 1888, the U.S. government passed the Scott Act which prevented any Chinese who was temporarily out of the country from ever returning. Thousands of Chinese who had made this country their home could never return.


Later in that same year; Congress added an amendment that said a Chinese man could only enter the U.S. if he had documents to prove he had a wife, child, mother or father here. The only classes exempt from this law were those who were priveleged: merchants, officials and students.


With the passage of these laws, the U.S. policy of free immigration stopped. In 1904, the Exclusion Act was extended indefinitely, culminating in the 1924 law which declared all aliens ineligible for citizenship.


The Chinese did not accept these laws of exclusion without protest, taking cases into court and encouraging overseas boycotts of American goods.


The Asian Exclusion Act and the laws that followed denied rights due to all people who worked, built and settled this land. It also denied citizenship and the right to own land to the Japanese when they came, forcing them to make their land out to their American-born children.


The Exclusion Act was finally repealed in 1943.


On this anniversary, we can pay our respects to those of our ancestors who fought back and tried to stay and build a life in this land, vowing that such exclusion acts will never be permitted to happen again.

In observance of this year's 84th anniversary of the Philippine declaration of independence, Mayor Charles Royer has proclaimed June 6 through 12 Philippine Week. The Filipino flag will fly outside City Hall to mark the occasion.


Several celebrations are scheduled in Seattle during Philippine Week. The Filipino Community of Seattle, Inc. has events scheduled daily, including a talent show on June 6, evening programs during the week, sport and game tournaments, an Independence Ball, and ending on June 13 with Parents Day. Most of the events will be held at the Filipino Community Center, 5470 Empire Way South.


On Saturday and Sunday, June 12 and 13, at the Seattle Center, a Philippine Independence Day Celebration will be held with various events sponsored by the Philippine Consulate General, the Philippine Cultural Heritage and the Seattle Center. Admission will be free to all events, which include exhibits of Philippine arts and crafts, films of the Philippines, dance and musical performances, and a Philippine Independence Dance Reception. Consulate Information Attache D.Y. Caparas explains that the celebration is an occasion to observe Philippine culture, ""which is part and parcel of the multi-cultural society in America."" For schedule information, contact the Seattle Center at 625-4234.


The seventh annual Philippine National Day Barrio Fiesta will be held Saturday, June 12, at Hing Hay Park in the International District. The theme of this year's program is Araw ng Pagkakaisa, Day of Unity. Food and handicraft booths will be set up, and entertainment such as Philippine dances will be offered.


Philippine National Day organizers Leni Marin and Esther Simpson say the Barrio Fiesta style celebration was chosen to keep the occasion informal ""The Barrio Fiesta is for all ages, rich poor, you don't have to worry about a babysitter, or what to wear,"" explains Marin.


Because the organizers want to introduce the Filipino community to other minorities cultures, there will be performances by some Latin American musical groups and possibly some martial arts demonstrations.


A memorial program will be included in this year's Philippine National Day celebration for Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, Filipino community activists and cannery union reformers who were shot and killed June 1, 1981. The Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes will present a slide show highlighting the events of the past year and a program of memorial songs and poems. A photo exhibit will trace the lives and work of the two men who were killed because of their efforts to reform the corrupt system of dispatching workers to jobs in Alaska's seafood processing industry.


Both Domingo and Viernes helped organize past Philippine National Day celebrations, Marin explained, and had worked on preparations for the celebration last year. Because the shooting occurred just before last year's planned Barrio Fiesta, however, the Fiesta was canceled in place of a memorial service on that day for Domingo.


The slide presentation being organized by the Committee for Justice will review the events of the last year including the murder trials of three men convicted in the killings.


The memorial program will be held in the Bush Asia Center, adjacent to Hing Hay Park, at 2 p.m.


Several other events will be held in memory of Domingo and Viernes, including a memorial program and luncheon at 1 p.m. on Saturday, June 5, at the ILWU Local 37 Union hall. Union members, family and friends will gather to honor the contributions. Viernes and Domingo made to the reform effort in the union.


On Friday, June 4, the Committee for Justice will present ""Silkwood,"" a highly-acclaimed one-woman play teaturing Jehane Dylan. The play depicts the story of union activist Karen Silkwood, and will show at 7 p.m. at the old Sharples Junior High School.

A twin theatre which will show first-run Chinese films by major producers from Hong Kong and Taiwan is under construction in the International District. Building permits have been obtained, and work has begun on renovation of a former automobile garage into the Kuo Hwa Theatre.


The Kuo Hwa will have two theatres, with 250 and 220 seating capacities. Owners Po Lin Chou and Ha To Le hope to open the theatres in late July or early August.


Chou and Le, who also own theatres in California and Oregon, plan to construct three retail spaces in the front of the building. Construction of the retail spaces is not expected to be completed until some time next year. A bookstore and videotape store may occupy two of those spaces. A restaurant currently located in the north end of the building is expected to remain and be refurbished.


The building, at 410 5th So., near Jackson, across from Union Station, was originally built in 1927 for he Rainier Heat and Power Company. Some time in the 1930's, it became the Apex Automotive Depot Garage until last year when the garage relocated.


Chou says he does not expect the increased availability of Chinese videotapes to hurt his business. ""With movies you have a big screen. TV is so small,"" he says. Besides, he continues, there are all kinds of movies, and videotapes are only copies.


The Kuo Hwa Theatre was designed by architect Johnny C. Li, of Monterey Park, and T. Kenneth Tang, structural engineer here in Seattle.

The Seattle Bumbershoot Festival recruited local comedians to sell souvenir programs, and they were there at eleven on Saturday morning at the Seattle Center.


Arnold Mukai rapped a stick on the concretepath. ""That gets their attention,"" he told a fellow comedian co-worker.


""Programs . . . two dollars!"" Mukai announced Bumbershooters who started to trickle in kept on walking past him or inspected his magazine and handed it back, saying ""It costs too much.""


That day. Arnold Mukai hustled Bumbershoot programs. The following day, he had the Opera House stage all to himself as an established local comedian on the verge of becoming a household name.


Mukai said he has always felt like an outcast, or a little different from everybody else. ""I definitely needed a sense of humor when I went to Garfield (High School), being that I was one of only ten Asians there. ""Two years ago, he attended a Laugh-Off at the Wayne Cody Comedy Store. Thinking he could do better than the comedians on stage, Mukai participated in the next Laugh-Off and placed twelfth. The next year, he placed fourth.


""Third runner up -- that sounds better,"" Mukai said, laughing.


Having decided to become a professional comedian Mukai began to work on his craft. Being a delivery driver for Purolator provided him a lot of time to himself to work on his routines. He took advantage of any situation where people would listen to him.


""I was at Geno's Tavern at one o'clock in the morning with three people who were drunk,"" Mukai remembered. ""The place holds 300. But I knew it wasn't always going to be like this.""


Experience in front of people proved to be good instruction for Mukai and provided new material for his act. People came up to him and said, ""Use this,"" or somebody in the audience would say something even funnier than he did and he would keep it.


""In the beginning, I didn't want anybody to talk to me,"" Mukai said. ""I just wanted to get up there, do my lines, and get off. But now I get into the audience. It's something new and something different every night. I always establish a rapport with the audience at the beginning.""


""When I was at Cody's, I only had 45 minutes of material, but I went on for an hour-and-a-half. You never know what's going to happen. A heckler might say something and you say something back, or a waitress might spill a drink on somebody.""


Non-white comedians are automatically placed in a precarious position: How far will they go in making fun of their race to get a laugh?


""I'm obviously different from every black and white comedian there's ever been. Every comedian needs a hook to make them different from other comedians, and that's my hook. But not everything I say is racial.""


Mukai recalled his attending a Laugh-Off in Los Angeles, where a half-Japanese comedian who capitalized on ""Jap jokes"" in his routine approached him and said, ""Another Jap comic, huh?""


""I don't like the word 'Jap,'"" Mukai said, ""and I've never used it in my life, But if he thinks that's what's funny, then other people might find it amusing. I think he's just another comedian with a hook, whether your're old and tell one liners, wear a white suit, or have an arrow through your head . . . whatever it is.""


But Mukai feels that there is a point when something is no longer funny and becomes demaining. He was offered work in a commercial, playing a character with a Japanese accent and acting ""dumb."" He turned it down.


""I just wouldn't feel right doing something like that,"" Mukai said. ""I don't think it's funny anyway.""


Besides running a day care with his wife, where he tries out some of his material on the kids and ""plays with their minds a lot,"" Mukai is able to make a living off of being a full-time local comedian. Sometimes he performs for the love of it.


""Every comedian will work for free if the audience is good,"" he added.


Twenty-seven year-old Arnold Mukai hopes to move on to the big-time in Hollywood.


""After the Laugh-Off's here, win or lose -- whatever happens. I'll probably move south. I just want to make a comfortable living in show-biz, whatever that is.""


Seattle is the fourth biggest city for comedy business, trailing Los Angeles New York, and San Francisco. Seattleites . . . for good comedy packed the Opera House for Arnold Mukai's set at Bumbershoot. His routine included skits about school days at Garfield, jokes about Japanese food, impressions of Desi Arnaz coming home to Lucy, Bruce Lee on a paper route, Popeye searching for Olive Oyle, John Wayne on the bumber cars, and a demonstration of a ""a cheap way to spend Fourth of July.""


Arnold Mukai talked before about how the applause in a big hall seems to originate from the back, then gains momentum, and rolls to the front like a thundering wave. After his 20-minute performance that day, the crowd's roar of approval must have sounded just the way he described it.

In other Asian countries, particularly those with a traditional Buddhist religion, New Year's is also a time of great celebration. The Vietnamese Tet and Korean New Year are also celebrated according to the lunar calendar, and falls on the same day as the Chinese New Year. New Year's is a time to honor the elders in the community and different societies and associations plan special celebrations for their communities.


Though many Koreans in the United States celebrate New Years on January 1, the lunar new year is considered the traditional celebration. On New Year's day, families gather to perform formal New Year bows of respect to the head of the family and other elders. The Seattle Korean Society plans a New Year party for the community's elders and there the bows of the traditional New Year salute are given.


The Vietnamese Buddhist Association will hold a New Year's celebration for its members at their temple at 1651 South King.


Japan adopted the Roman calendar during the Meiji restoration period and has since celebrated the New Year on January 1. In Japan, New Year's is celebrated on the first three days in January Food must be brought in advance, because all stores and businesses are closed on those days. Preparations begin in the last days of December, and just before midnight, on December 31, the bells of the Buddhist temples and shrines begin to ring. The bells ring 107 times before midnight, and then after midnight they ring one more time. The 108 rings represent the 108 evils in man described by Buddha. The last ring happens in the New Year to acknowledge that people are still human and will carry a little of their passions into the New Year.


Some Southeast Asian societies celebrate their New Year in the spring. The three-day Cambodian New Year begins on April 13. The Pi Mai, or Lao New Year falls on any day between the sixth waxing moon period in April and the fifth waxing moon period in May, usually between April 12 and 15. The ceremony lasts from one to two weeks, depending on the region.


The Hmong have already celebrated their New Year, which begins when the moon is darkest in December. New Years is the most important celebration for the Hmongs, and traditionally the only time they take off from work.

Just 10 years ago this month, June 17, 1972 to be exact, a little incident changed the course of American history. When this incident was first reported, the coverage was limited to two or three paragraphs buried on the back pages of the newspaper. You probably ignored it. Most people did. But we were all affected.


This little incident changed the fortunes of many. It could be best described as the biggest mud-slinging fight our country got dragged into. But without it, Gerald Ford would not have been the first person to serve first as Vice-President and the President without a vote of the people. Without it, Alexander Haig would still be among the anonymous in the Pentagon rather than the current Secretary of State.


Leaks. Plumbers. The White House Tapes, Dirty tricks. Erlichman, Haldeman, Mitchell, and Dean, Bugs, Woodstein. The Washington Post. ""I am not a crook."" All the President's Men. Coverup. The hearing Impeachment. Put them all together and you've got Watergate. Ten years ago this month, seven men were caught by a security guard breaking into Lawrence O'Brien's office, the headquarters of the Democractic Party in the Watergate complex in Washington D.C.


That's what Watergate was ... a little break-in that mushroomed into the resignation of a President of the United States. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, New College Edition, defines ""Watergate"" as ""a scandal that involves officials violating public or corporate trust through perjury, bribery, and other abuses of power in order to keep their elective or appointed positions."" And even though Richard M. Nixon was the first President who went to China, finally got the troops out of Vietnam, and won two Presidential elections, his name will forever be linked with the political disgrace identified with Watergate.


The break in at the Watergate itself was just a simple burglary, seven men caught trying to retrieve some bugging devices. But it was not the break-in that led to Richard Nixon's downfall, it was the cover up by ""all the President's men"" and the President. As the cover-up unraveled, the public found out not only about the role of the White House in the Watergate break-in, but about illegal payoffs, officials lying under oath, and incredible acts of harrassment by Nixon officials against private citizens. The public trust had been betrayed, the people lied to.


Government officials before and after Watergate have been found to be corrupt. The public trust has, is, and will be violated. It's a sad fact of American politics that it does happen so frequently. We elect our leaders on the assumption that they possess the highest moral integrity. It's too bad a character test could not be devised to weed out the corrupt among them. But as the old joke goes, then we wouldn't have any leaders.


The Watergate scandal exposed a government teeming with liars and cheats. The uncovering of the lies, the corruption, and cover-up we know as Watergate damaged the faith of the people in government. If anything, Watergate should have made us a little bit more cynical, a little bit unwilling to accept what the government says at face value.


And it almost passed without notice in this country. If it were not for an aggressive press and the dedication of some reporters to find the truth, we might easily not known about it. Without the press who dug deep for facts and who exposed the Watergate scandal, those people might have continued to say that nothing happened and might have easily gotten away with it.


Now suppose the break-in didn't occur; suppose that, on June 17, 1972, the guard who made the rounds that night at the Watergate complex found nothing suspicious. What would have happened if the political payoffs, the bribery, the laundering of money, the invasions of privacy hadn't been detected? Well, for one thing, Richard Nixon would be a lot more respected today. But who knows what devious plans the Nixon people would have had for you if your name had somehow got on the famous White House enemies list?


Watergate didn't end government corruption. Far from it, public officials still get indicted for accepting bribes, making payoffs, and lying under oath. But at least we know about it. Other countries, like those under martial law, have newspapers controlled by the government and their people don't know about the payoffs, bribes, and lies of their leaders.


No, corruption is a fact of life in American politics. But Watergate did make us pay attention to government corruption. It has made the people look not only to whether a public official's conduct is above board but whether the conduct appeared above board. And that is the lesson of Watergate which every public official should remember when called to face their board of ethics.


Watergate was a disgraceful chapter in American politics. When it was first reported, the coverage was limited to two or three paragraphs buried on the back pages of the newspaper. You probably ignored it. Most people did. I'm glad someone didn't.

The Health Fair, sponsored by the American Red Cross, Channel 5 (King-TV) and the National Health Screening Council for Volunteer Organizations, is coming to the Puget Sound from May 10 to 16. The Health Fair is part of a nationwide program which began in Washington D.C. in 1976.


A wide range of duties are performed by the 2,000 community volunteers, many of whom are in the health field. These volunteers have gone through orientation training and will provide 10,000 volunteer hours.


Health Fair sites will be set up at local schools, malls, businesses, clubs, hospitals and community centers. Anne Arakaki, Health Fair project director who is based at the local Red Cross headquarters, explains that each of the 25 different sites will offer free health services to anyone 18 and up. Each site will offer screenings according to the community needs, she added. Certain sites -- such as the Bush-Asia Center, Chinese Baptist Church and the Asian American Alliance in Tacoma -- will focus on the various needs of the Asian community. Other sites such as Highline Community College and Columbia Club will concentrate on older Americans.


Among the services provided by medical personnel are: health screenings (for height, weight, blood pressure and visual acuity) and anemia checks. Where possible, additional screening for oral, breast, foot and hearing problems, pap tests, sickle cell tests and cholesterol tests will be provided. After basic screening, results will be reviewed with the participant and referral to other medical facilities will be made, if necessary. This review will help the participant identify health goals, understand the results and better understand the importance of disease prevention.


Learning centers will also be set up in the Health Fair sites, with counselors who will explain each test procedure and offer professional review of all results. Materials and exhibits, including a Heart & Lung Association exhibit, will be on hand.


But most important, a follow-up will take place for each person who participates in the screening. Volunteer health professionals will attempt to motivate those with potential problems to take appropriate action, encourage continued positive health awareness, increase knowledge of how habits affect health and mail all participants a copy of test results.


Anne Arakaki began working with the Red Cross in January, but has accomplished a great deal. ""Health services need a limitless amount of attention from the community by people serving people within their community -- a little from everyone,"" she said.


Also, later this year, the annual Nikkei Health Fair will be held on October 9. This fair will emphasize preventive health care education, and will offer screening tests and a learning center.


For more information on the Health Fair '82, please contact Anne Arakaki at 323-2345, ext. 233-235.

Solar greenhouse (sun space) additions to existing homes, as a way to increase living space and reduce the cost of home heating, are becoming increasingly popular. If your house has an unobstructed southern exposure and there is enough space in the lot to build you may want to consider adding a solar greenhouse.


The solar greenhouse design, which largely consists of window space, illuminates an open-space atmosphere and is contemporary looking. It can be an attractive addition that may increase the market-value of your home, as well as provide greater enjoyment.


Seattle, although generally cloudy much of December and January, has a relatively mild climate. Home heating can be inexpensively maintained with a passive solar heating system, backed up with conventional heating systems using wood, oil, gas or electricity. Our area's long heating season makes solar energy an attractive alternative heating system. If properly designed and installed, a passive solar system can provide up to 50 percent of a home's space heating requirement.


Besides adding living space and reducing heating cost, the solar greenhouse can be used to grow food and plants. A variety of vegetables can be grown year-round in the greenhouses, as well as starts and annuals for your garden. Because the greenhouse may accumulate excessive heat in the summer if not properly ventilated, it can cause damage to plants.


The cost of a solar greenhouse ranges from $2,000 to $12,000, depending upon the size, materials, and how much of the work you want to do yourself.


Solar energy is derived directly from sunlight (solar radiation). Solar energy property includes ""active"" and ""passive"" solar systems or a combination of both.


A passive solar system is based on the use of conductive, convective, or radiant energy transfer. A passive solar system contains all of the following:


1) A solar collection area,


2) An absorber,


3) A storage mass,


4) A heat distribution method, and


5) A heat regulation device.


A solar collection area is a large area of transparent or translucent material, such as glass, positioned so that the rays of the sun directly strike an absorber.


An absorber is a surface, such as a floor, that is exposed to the rays of the sun. The absorber changes solar radiation into heat, and then transfers the heat to a storage mass.


A storage mass is material, such as masonry, that receives and holds heat from the absorber and later releases the heat to the inside of the home. The storage mass must be large enough to store and deliver enough solar heat for the size of the home. The area of the storage mass that is directly exposed to the rays of the sun must be at least as large as the solar collection area. Also, the storage mass must be located so that is it capable of distributing the stored heat directly to the living areas of the home through a heat distribution method.


A heat distribution method is a system that releases radiant or convective heating from the storage mass to the living areas of the home.


A heat regulation device is a shading or venting mechanism, such as awnings or insulated drapes, to control the amount of solar heat admitted through the solar collection areas, and nighttime insulation or its equivalent to control the amount of heat permitted to escape from the inside of the home.


The solar greenhouse works simply as a solar heat collector by accepting the increasing sunlight which turns to heat as it strikes dark objects inside. The glass windows re-radiate part of the heat back into the structure as it tries to escape and prevents drafts from dispersing the heat collected.


A greenhouse should face within 30 degrees of true south, and be free from any obstacles which might block the rays from the sun. In the northern hemisphere the sun travels through the southern skyspace so that south-facing windows maximize solar gain.


In the winter, sunlight passes through the windows and warms the darkened surfaces of the concrete floor, brick wall, water-filled drums, or other storage mass. Some heat is absorbed into the thick concrete and brick and the water, where it will remain stored until the indoor temperature begins to cool after the sun sets. The heat not absorbed by the storage elements can raise the air temperature inside the greenhouse, during the day, into the 90 degrees to 100 degreesF range. As long as the sun shines, this heat can be circulated into the house by natural convection or drawn in by low-horsepower fan.


At sunset greenhouse windows should be covered with movable insulation to control heat loss. A greenhouse will remain warm as long as it can draw on the heat in its storage elements. The storage elements will continue to supply heat until they are the same temperature as the air in the living space.


While all materials have some capacity for heat storage, certain materials are primarily used for their specific heat, high density, thermal conductivity, and relative low cost. Water and masonry have good qualities in these regards with the capability to store significant amounts of heat over a small temperature range in a manageable volume. Thermal mass, such as water or masonry, plays an important role in passive designs by moderating the high and low temperature extremes within the home. Masonry walls and floors or specially constructed water walls lessen daytime overheating problems by storing heat. Low night time temperatures are tempered by the release of this stored heat into the room. The location of thermal mass is an important design consideration for its effective performance. The mass should be located so that it is exposed to sunlight at least part of the day. In addition, it is important not to cover thermal mass areas, such as masonry floors, with decorations like wall-to-wall carpeting. The carpeting would prevent the masonry floor from absorbing and storing the heat. Partially covering thermal mass floors with area rugs is an acceptable approach.


The greenhouse that is attached to the house is a popular passive design style. When attached or integrated into the south wall of the home, the greenhouse becomes a solar collector absorbing the sun's radiation. Temperatures inside the greenhouse increase so that excess heat can be transferred to the other areas of the home. This heat transfer process can be achieved by natural convection air flow through vents, doors, or windows. Other heat transfer options include using a fan to force the greenhouse air into the home heat transfer through a common masonry wall, or the use of a rock bin storage system.


One word of caution. A solar greenhouse will not function effectively unless the entire house is properly insulated. This includes the ends of the greenhouse, which must also be able to resist heat loss through drafts.

""Stress"" has become a catch-all for the troubles of our time and ""stress management"" one of the major solutions. It would be nice if it were that easy.


On the other hand, using stress management techniques can help you and me stay in good enough shape to deal with Reaganomics, etc., etc. Stress is a part of life -- all that means is any time we respond to a new or unexpected situation, our mind-body puts out extra effort -- stress is whatever puts us on ""alert.""


We've been dealing with stress all along; our foremothers had to shoo the tiger from the cave. But today we deal with a high level of man-made stress: uncontrolled technological changes that create a complexity many times more stressful than that tiger.


How we deal with stress will help determine if we live to be vigorous octogenarians (according to the folks who know, we are living into our 80's and older now) or candidates for full-time care. The point of stress management is to keep us at optimal functioning, come what may; stress reduction could be the topic of a whole separate column.


Why is stress management an important issue for Asian Pacific women? Because we're in multiple jeopardy. On the scales of who survives comfortably in our society, where do we fall in terms of race, sex, class, and age? An Asian working class woman in her 50's has a lot more stress than the mainstream lady from Bellevue.


But our cultural traditions sometimes give us advantages also. Two that I've observed relate to cooperation and anger:


Our Asian Pacific Women's Caucus includes a range of ethnic and class backgrounds and ages. It operates very differently than mainstream feminist organizations. We do almost everything by group consensus and allow space for the less verbally aggressive members -- and we've been doing that before Theory Z became popular! We also usually deal with our anger in less explosive or direct ways which can sometimes be criticized as frustrating or passive. On the other hand, Western science has discovered that severe anger outbursts disrupt the function of the thymus, which controls the immunity system.


Another pressure we sometimes find ourselves under now as Asian Pacific women is the ""Superwoman Syndrome."" Superwoman has to ""make it"" in the mainstream world of status and power and make it by still being acceptable in the Asian Pacific community. Example from a caucus workshop on assertiveness: ""It's okay for me to be assertive in the white business world but I have to handle myself very differently in the community."" We either stress ourselves being Superwoman or stress ourselves because we're not Superwoman! Talk about Catch 22!


There are four main areas to check off in personal stress management. In explaining the areas, I'll use the word ""mindbody"" as I did earlier for a very good reason: the Western world created a division between mind and body that Asian and other Third World traditions do not have. Western medical science is now ""discovering"" that the division is shaky and that healing people is an inseparable combination of healing mind and body together.


The four areas are: nutrition, exercise, relaxation, and emotional support.


Nutrition: There are high stress and low stress foods (our traditional rice and vegetables diet was healthy until we got fancy). Falling under high stress are: coffee, sugar, alcohol, MSG, salt fat Low stress: foods high in vitamin B, proteins, fruits, vegetables. Nutrition is a perfect example of the mind-body connection. The foods we prefer are usually the ones our minds have been socialized to prefer, not necessarily the ones our bodies know are good for us: ""Momma always gave me cookies when I was good""; and ""The real business in this office gets settled at coffee."" With a diet high in sugar, caffeine, salt, and fat, sooner or later your body will hit your mind hard with a 2 x 4.


Exercise: Luckily, exercise is now ""in,"" so mind-body agree. Both stretching and vigorous exercise are important on a regular basis for optimal functioning.


Relaxation: This is also coming into vogue. All kinds of folks are now exploring meditation -- what several Asian traditions have been following for centuries. ""Meditation"" per se is not necessary but a daily break (just before dinner is a good time) where you relax and let go for at least fifteen minutes is as healthy as an apple a day.


Emotional Support: Underlined because this is the one people seem to neglect the most. Mind-body health includes taking care of your emotions. That means supporting yourself (""Yes, my intuition was right on""; ""Hey, that guy was really out of line""; ""I deserve to take myself to a movie for that one."" It also means getting support from friends; about a half dozen is ideal so you don't burn each other out and you're okay if five go on vacation. For example: ""Yuck, what would you have done in that situation?""; ""I was ready to scream, but I called you instead.""


The proof is in the pudding ... try a small step in one of the stress management areas; reward yourself when you achieve a small step. Stress management won't make multiple jeopardy or Superwoman go away. But it will help us have healthy mind-bodies to face those and whatever other challenges approach our caves in the 1980s. Don't let the tigers get you down!

""I drink a little bit of whiskey, makes the blood go around, makes healthy,"" says 84-year-old Henry Chin, revealing the secret of his long and productive life in Seattle's International District-Chinatown.


Henry was one of about 20 retired and active cooks recently honored at a banquet given by the owners of Linyen Restaurant and United Savings and Loan Board Chairman Robert . . .


""I thought it would be fun to have a special day for you for making Chinatown what it is today,"" Linyen owner Elaine Young said to the attentive chefs and cooks who have worked for Tenkatsu, Hong Kong Restaurant, Atlas Cafe and many other Asian restaurants in and around Seattle.


Henry though he's 84, still helps out at the Linyen Restaurant teaching the resident cooks his trade secrets.


In his heyday, Henry worked in several prominent restaurants including the Tai Tung and the New Chinatown in the International District and the Outrigger, a restaurant which preceded Trader Vic's in downtown Seattle. ""Mostly American food,"" he said. Henry also fondly remembers cooking for ""rich people"" including the head of the Boeing Company in the early 1950's who once a month held ""big parties,"" Henry said.


Henry was born in China, came to Seattle in 1917 and almost immediately went to work at the Shanghai Restaurant, then located on 2nd Avenue, for ""one dollar a day, cooking, dishwashing, cutting vegetables."" Ever since, Henry said, he has worked in restaurants, with the exception of five to six years in the late 1920's when he worked as a foreman in the canneries in Alaska.


He was 17 and living in Canton, Henry remembers, when his father, already operating a Chinese laundry in Seattle, sent him money to come to the United States. Henry remembers boarding a Japanese freighter leaving for Seattle. The crossing ""took 32 days,"" Henry said, ""and [the freighter] was very crowded, lots of people, 70 to 80 people. I stayed in the bottom of the ship."" The fare, Henry said with emphasis, was ""only $65 to come over.""


Henry has lived in Chinatown most of his adult life. In 1921, he went back to China to marry the daughter of the cook he worked with in a Seattle restaurant. His new bride, however, ""didn't want to come to the United States,"" Henry said.


Although he came back alone from China, Henry's family has grown over the years. He has children and grandchildren scattered around the Northwest as well as in Asia, he visits, but never lives with them. ""I like living in Chinatown,"" Henry says. ""Everyday, I go to the Hi-lite [Cafe] for donut and coffee, play cards, play some pool."" Henry also ventures from his small room atop the Linyen Restaurant to eat lunch with friends at the nutrition program at the Bush-Asia Center. Some evenings he buys a small piece of ""tenderloin steak, and go home and cook,"" he says.


Talking of times past, Henry remembers Seattle's Chinatown when sidewalks were made of wood. King Street was ""all lumber, no cement and one street car go up King Street,"" Henry said. In Chinatown, Henry remembers when ""only Goon Dip and Quong Tuck had cars.""


And gambling was big in Chinatown. ""Everybody gambled,"" Henry said. ""Big gambling."" Henry talks from experience. He worked for a nightclub at 7th and King in the 1940s. ""I worked as a dealer. Someone makes $200, dealer gets $10 tip, make good money."" Henry remembers paying for police protection, then ""they don't bother you. Now it's different. You can't do that now...""


Chinese women were rare sights in Seattle. There were ""no Chinese women at all,"" Henry exaggerated. ""Very peaceful,"" he said, chuckling.


Perhaps because of the shortage of Chinese women, Henry says, many Chinese males dated white women but ""kept it secret"" because of racial tensions.


Henry also dated and eventually wed a ""lo fan,"" a Caucasian, even though he still had a wife in China.


Henry quickly explained that he had remarried thinking that his wife in China was killed during the War. Henry said that, over the years prior to World War II, he maintained a correspondence with his wife who had stayed in China. When the War came, Henry found out later, his wife had gone to Chungking for safety, but all correspondence had ceased. ""I no hear from her. She missing. I thought the Japanese killed her.""


For six to seven years. Henry estimated, he didn't hear from his wife in China. Meanwhile, he met his future second wife when she came to work in a restaurant he operated in downtown Seattle. ""She was a good worker,"" Henry said. ""She had a good heart."" For whatever reasons, after not hearing from his wife in China and presuming her killed, Henry remarried.


After the War, his first wife had gone back to Hong Kong and ""she sent me a letter,"" Henry said.


Henry divorced his Causasion wife in 1950 but keeps in touch with her to this day.


At 84, Henry remains active working part-time at Linyen Restaurant. ""That's why Linyen have good business now,"" he says in all seriousness. Henry is a familiar figure in the International District, walking up and down King Street saying hello to old and new friends alike. He shoots pool at the Hilite and continues to gamble. ""I just win a little bit and get out, I lose a little bit and get out,"" he says.


And with a toothless grin, he tells me the secret of his long life: ""I smoke 62 years, never get sick. I drink a little bit of whiskey ... makes the blood go around makes healthy.""

Some Asian women professionals have difficulty moving up in the business world because they have never thought in terms of self',"" stated Doris Wong. ""They only think of helping others around them.""


Wong is a partner in D.W. Associates, an executive recruitment agency focusing on the recruitment and referral of minority and female professionals. While earning her sociology degree from the University of Washington, she worked for Channel 9 as a secretary. After graduation, she continued working for Channel 9 while advancing in her career, from membership supervisor to underwriting and grants person. KRAB radio recruited Wong to be its development director. She later changed careers and worked for Royal Recruiters Agency, an executive recruitment agency. In 1980, she and two women started their own recruitment company. D.W. Associates.


Wong has encountered many Asian women professionals: those moving up in management and those who are not. Both types of Asian women professionals are generally college educated, fluent in English, ""efficient at their jobs, and work twice as hard as their white counterparts,"" stated Wong.


The Asian woman professional who is moving up in the business world is aggressive and assertive in a positive way. Determined to develop business skills, she has an extra push and is not afraid to take risks. ""She is highly active in political or social organizations,"" commented Wong.


She has learned to politik. She knows the players their personalities, management, and business styles. She has learned how to work with the players to accomplish her goals."" Because of these traits, she avoids being overlooked during promotions. She may or may not keep a low profile, but she receives her due recognition. Getting recognition -- visibility -- is a keying redient in moving up in management, said Wong.


The Asian woman professional who is not moving up in the business world is passive and complacent, said Wong, perhaps because of her Asian and sexual upbringing. ""They have never thought in terms of self,"" explained Wong. ""They only think of helping others around them."" Culturally programmed to keep a low, often subservient, profile, the less successful Asian woman professional is afraid to take risks, make waves, or deal with confrontations. But to make it in management, said Wong, she has to be assertive, sometimes selfish, and willing to make sacrifices, take risks, and stand out from the crowd. She has to look for and create opportunities for herself because few executive jobs are just there waiting for a person, said Wong.


Asian women have only recently moved into management positions. Thus, there are few role models for aspiring Asian women executives to identify with, and few support groups to join. But, stressed Wong, they do exist and are growing in number. She advises Asian women to get involved in community and volunteer activities, join organizations, and establish networking contacts.


She also advises Asian women to go through a self-assessment process to determine if they really want to move up the executive ladder. One suggestion is to separately list what they like to do in their personal lives and what they like or would like to do in their careers. Analyzing both lists for compatible and incompatible traits, the Asian woman can determine if she really wants to or is able to move up in management. For some people, the sacrifices in their personal lives and values are not worth it, said Wong.


If the Asian woman wants to move up in management, she must set goals and plan her career development in areas of job changes and skills to master. Without planning, their career goals. Wong said: ""When people reach a certain plateau, they realize they're very unhappy. Some people may have moved up too fast without being ready or may have moved beyond their capabilities."" Aspiring Asian female executives should know what they want to do, plan their career goals, and take action.

The Employment Opportunities Center (EOC) will host an open house of its Bellevue offices on Friday, December 3 at 1:30 p.m.


EOC houses its Refugee Employment Program and an Eastside Short-term Training Project at its Bellevue offices, located at 15749 NE 4th Street. The programs train refugees in housekeeping/maintenance and electronic assembly. Staff also provide employment preparation classes, resume writing, bilingual counseling, job development, referral and placement.


The staff are bilingual and speak Lao, Vietnamese, Khmer and Chinese. ""There are nearly 2,400 refugees residing east of Lake Washington,"" said Khampheng (K.P.) Phimsone, Supervisor of the Refugee Employment Program, ""and most of them still have minimal English skills. The staff help them make the transition to American society.""


Several area businesses are involved in the Short-term Training Project and supply instructors. ""We felt this was a more realistic and productive expenditure of money because professionals in the industry know what they want in an employee,"" continued Dr. Robert Flor, Program Coordinator. ""This strategy allows us to simulate the entire process an American crew would engage in.""


The open house will begin with orientation at 1:30 p.m. At 2 p.m., there will be a housecleaning class tour, followed by an office open house at 3 p.m., and an electronic assembly class tour at 4 p.m.

""Lotus Blossom Does Not Live Here Anymore"" was a ringing cry at the Washington State Conference for Women back in 1977. In Lotus Blossom's place bloomed the Asian Pacific Women's Caucus.


1974 saw International Women's Year. Women world-wide met in Mexico City to discuss women's issues and develop international recommendations. On the heels of this conference, then President Carter called for a national women's conference for 1977. The states convened their own conferences to develop their platforms and elect delegates to the national conference in Houston.


In Washington, Ellensburg was designated as the conference site. As preparations were made for the conference, interest and fervor increased. The state conferences and the Houston conference gained added importance as varied groups saw these as the means to affect national policies on women.


Feminist organizations were at the forefront. But more traditional women's groups and churches also got organized. Battle lines were drawn in the states over a list of issues -- ERA, abortion, working conditions and the family, among others.


Minority women saw the need for a state-wide women's network to protect their interests. Rita Elway, a member of Carter's national commission to convene the conference and a member of the state organizing committee, initiated the efforts to organize Asian and Pacific women. ""The idea of a feminist group within the Asian community did not meet a groundswell of support,"" Elway said. ""But we did not expect feminism to come to the aid of Asian women. The conference was coming up and we had issues that needed articulation. If we did not do it, no one else would.""


A small group of women became the nucleus. The immediate task were establishing a network, developing an agenda and working with other minority women's groups.


Sally Kazama, co-chair of the Caucus today, said, ""We felt it important that minority women get involved in the conference. The groups already involved were primarily white women who were middle class and sounded anti-male. Our concerns were not just sexism but racism and agism as well. Our men are victims of racism. We are in this fight together.""


At the conference, the Caucus was well-organized and effective. It was a dramatic beginning. The Caucus continued to meet, drawing more Asian/Pacific women and becoming a community force.


Today, the Caucus is highly visible and effective. It won a grant from the Department of Labor to conduct a conference on the employment status and problems of Asian/Pacific women. It helped plan a comparable worth conference. It battled with the University of Washington administrators over a new policy to admit only those most likely to succeed in its Educational Opportunity Program. It has testified on social service, education, health, and employment policies, worked on discrimination suits, and spoken for garment workers. It has tackled both the public and private sectors.


The Caucus profile reveals diversity Working women at home and in the labor force of different ages and varying degrees of assimilation work together to provide a voice for community concerns.


The Caucus has employed a variety of styles to bring about change. Through endorsements, letters of concern, meetings, and work committees, the Caucus serves as an advocate and a defender of Asian community concerns.


Maria Batayola, co-chair, provided an insight on the Caucus style: ""In a way, we are more conservative because we use the tools available to us through the system. We are creative in our responses because we have to be."" Batayola gave an example of how the Caucus has worked. The 1980 Christmas season saw Sears selling Iwo Jima toys. The Caucus asserted that the toy portrayed Japanese in a stereotypical aggressive, and buck-toothed manner. Through discussion with Sears management, the toy was removed from the Northwest market.


Members and other community groups alert the Caucus to pending issues. Specific action is decided at the monthly meetings. The Caucus stresses that it is a working group.


As the focal point for Asian/Pacific women in this community, the group looks forward to impacting the system more. An increased involvement with the city and county offices of women's rights, employment issues, and budget cuts on the federal, state, and local levels are priorities.


""There are so many issues of concern that it is sometimes difficult to prioritize and deal with them (all) because of limited resources and energy,"" said Batayola, ""and we find ourselves repeatedly assuming a defensive or protective stance, rather than an advocacy role.""


The Caucus encourages both women and men to join. Members work hard but it has become a source of mutual assistance and friendship. ""The Caucus is a way for Asian women to get together and solve problems,"" remarked founding member Dolores Sibonga. ""It also provides a great support system. There are many things that we can't always share with other women; but, with the Caucus, there is a shared cultural awareness.""

(Turning Shadows Into Light: Art and Culture of the Northwest's Early Asian/Pacific Community. Edited by Mayumi Tsutakawa and Alan Chong Lau Young Pine Press 1982.)


A group of Seattle artists and writers have published a landmark Asian American anthology which according to the book's introduction, presents ""a gathering of the creative responses of individuals to their environment.""


Turning Shadows Into Light -- a collection of essays photographs artwork and literature on Asian American artists of the Northwest before the Second World War -- includes stories of early Chinese and Japanese artists, photographers and writers, and Filipino boxers and musicians. Contemporary poetry is interspersed throughout the book, voices reflecting on and responding to these early artists.


Robert Monroe's article on the Seattle Camera Club is perhaps the most impressive in depicting the artists wide-ranging success and the ultimate loss of the group's art. The Seattle Camera Club organized by Issei photographers, flourished from 1920 to 1940. Most of the members followed the Pictorial Movement, turning ""beautiful objects and experiences into beautiful images. Eventually many of the members' prints were shown throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. The Depression led to the Club's disbanding in 1929. After the tragedy of World War II, few of the photographers prints and negatives survived.


The works of two members, Dr. Kyo Koike and Frank Kunishige, are featured and illustrate two divergent paths: the traditional, Asian-inspired, and the individualistic, modern style. Koike, an Issei from Shimane Prefecture, was the leader of the Seattle Camera Club and its most prolific member. His prints of Northwest landscapes and Seattle cityscapes combine the Pictorialist concern with a Japanese sensibility. The prevailing tone is serene and pastoral but the composition is decidedly Japanese -- dark pines against a misty back ground of pine-covered hills or a calm lake with three piers in the foreground a small sailboat on the horizon.


Kunishige's work is more modern. Kunishige came to the United States from Yamaguchi Prefecture when he was 17, while Koike was 38 when he arrived. In his work, Kunishige concentrates on the human form clothed or nude, and abstract shapes, lines and shades.


Equally impressive in scope but drier in tone is Mayumi Tsutakawa's essay on Northwest painters before World War II. Short sketches are presented on a great many artists, including George Tsutakawa, Fay Chong, and Frank Okada. The prints of artworks are notable, but one wishes for more detail and insight into the lives and inspiration of the artists.


Two essays on Filipino American life are presented. The first Peter Bacho's ""A Manong's Heart,"" tells of young Filipino men who pursued boxing careers, not only to escape poverty and drudgery, but to attain equality, for ""the prize ring was a suspension of society's norms.""


""Sweet Music"" by Robert Park Antolin recounts the music and night life of Filipino jazz musicians who played in big bands of the day. Frank Osias was one such musician who played with several Filipino big bands in Seattle, with such exotic names as the Moonlight Serenaders, the Rizal Club Orchestra, and the Manila Tropical Troubadours. These bands played for community socials and taxi dances, where the Filipino bachelors would pay a token to dance with white, Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese taxidancers, some of whom were also prostitutes.


Carlos Bulosan has depicted the life of early Filipino Americans most notably, and three of his works are included in this edition. ""My First Day in America"", describes his arrival in Seattle from the Philippines. It is a wonderful short piece, full of humor and nostalgia. ""My Father Was a Working Man"" is a very good, conventional poem, but probably the best piece in the whole book is the poem ""What Would You Do?"", a stirring outcry from a betrayed heart.


The internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was a painful event for Issei, and many never expressed their feelings about it. But Shizue Iwatsuki, an Issei woman from the Hood River Valley of Oregon, wrote a cycle of tanka, translated by Stephen Kohl, on this subject. The tanka (Japanese poems of 31 syllables arranged 5-7-5-7-7) describe her family's interr, ment in Pinedale, Tule Lake, and Minidoka relocation camps and their sad return home after the War. The following tanka indicates the historical significance of the experience:


Writing the history


Of these events


For later generations


My own anxieties


Seem trivial indeed.


The modern poets featured are Alan Chong Lau Laureen Mar, Garrett Kaoru Hongo, Lonny Kaneko, James Masao Mitsui and Lawson Fusao Inada. Many of the poems concern history, such as Mar's ""The Immigration Act of 1924,"" or Kaneko's ""Camp Harmony: Puyallup Fairgrounds 1978/1942."" Inada's ""Songs in the Ancient Tradition"" is a long poem inspired by ancient Chinese poetry Garrett Hongo wrote a particularly haunting poem with the unmanageable title, ""On the Last Performance of Musume Dojoji at the Nippon Kan of the Astor. Hotel, Seattle, Washington,"" which has a beautiful surrealistic ending.


While this volume is a commendable undertaking, its impressive appearance sets up expectations of quality not always fulfilled. The writing is uneven; some of the essays are dry and thin. Ed and Betty Burke's article on the restoration of the Nippon Kan, although containing much information and scarce photographs of the period, seems self-congratulatory. And Sui Sin Far, writing of her experiences as a Eurasian communicates an almost condescending attitude toward Chinese. She uses the term ""Chinaman"" with an unconscious acceptance that may reflect the period, but is dubious.


Turning Shadows Into Light is, nevertheless, a landmark book both for Asian Americans and for art in the Northwest. It illuminates the rich, diverse artistic and cultural heritage which heretofore remained obscure. As Alan Chong Lau states in the introduction, ""This book is a beginning."" Hopefully, more scholars and writers will persist in recording the history that is ours and that evolves relentlessly.

July is the time of the year for the Bon a celebration held in Japan, and in Buddhist churches in the United States. The best known activity of the Bon festivities is the Bon Odori, odori meaning dance, a community festival usually held at the end of the celebration. The largest Bon Odori in this country is held each year at the Seattle Buddhist Church.


The traditions of the Bon, sometimes called the Obon, date back to the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, over 1400 years ago. The Festival was adopted during the Heian period, 794-1185 A.D.; when Buddhism, a religion practiced mainly by the nobility and monks, was adapted as a religion for the general population.


The Obon, which gets its name from the Sanskrit word, ullambana, a rare flower that only blooms once every one hundred years, is a celebration of life. Sometimes called the festival of souls, or the feast of the dead, it is a time when the spirits of ancestors and loved ones are welcomed back to earth. It is a time to visit family graves, and special memorial services are held in the temples.


But the celebration is not for the dead, explains Reverend Gerald Sakamoto, of the White River Buddhist Church in Auburn. ""It is for those of us who continue to live,"" he says.


""It is a time for us to reflect on our own existence,"" he explains. ""It is important for us to really appreciate this present existence, and not take it for granted.""


Many of the Bon traditions grew from a Buddhist story that takes place in India, where Buddhism began. According to the legend, one of Buddha's disciples, a man named Mokuren, envisioned the mother he had been forced to abandon in order to follow Buddha in the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts when she died. When Mokuren asked Buddha how to release his mother from this hell, Buddha instructed Mokuren to give support and care to the other disciples and the greater community. When Mokuren followed these instructions the mother was released from her sufferings. Through Mokuren's sharing the difficulties his mother was enduring were ended, explains Reverend Sakamoto. They were not solved, he continues by introspection or meditation, but by the disciple's concern for the larger community.


According to the legend, when Mokuren saw that his mother had been released he and the other disciples broke into a dance, from which the tradition of the Bon Odori came.


Reverend Eigiro Fujii, of the Seattle Buddhist church, says the Bon Odori is dancing for joy. The festival is traditionally held in the evening, and continues into the night. The Seattle Bon Odori which grows in popularity each year will be held on July 24 and 25, at the Buddhist church at 14th and Main, east of the International District. The festival will feature traditional Japanese folk music and dancing, lots of food and special events such as the third annual performance of the Kinnara Taiko Group from Los Angeles. and 110 dancers visiting from Japan. The dancers will come from the Shiga prefecture, and perform Saturday evening. July 24, before continuing to their Prefecture's sister state Michigan.


The White River Buddhist Church will hold us Bon Odori the following Saturday, July 31 in Auburn south of Seattle.

The former executive director of the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs accepted an offer last month to head the news department of East/West, the prominent weekly Chinese American newspaper published out of San Francisco.


""I would like the newspaper to cover a broader range of Pan-Asian news and Asian American community news,"" said Diane Yen-Mei Wong, former Commission director, commenting on her recent appointment.


She will begin her position as associate editor of the bilingual newspaper sometime later this year, replacing current associate editor Mary Castagnozzi, who is moving overseas. Wong will work on the English section of the paper, coordinating the gathering of news, editing stories, laying out the newspaper and continuing to write news stories.


Wong, well-known to many in Seattle's Asian community, served as director of the State Commission from September, 1978, to May, 1980, and previously worked as a Legal Services attorney in the International District, assisting community social service agencies including the International District Improvement Association.


Wong relocated from Seattle to the San Francisco Bay area in 1980, serving a one-and-a-half-year stint as director of the Chinatown Youth Center, an advocacy and counseling service helping juvenile delinquents.


Wong, who has been writing freelance articles for East/West for the past several months, recently wrote lead articles on the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Bill, a major revamping, of immigration law, and the trial of Chol Soo Lee, a Korean immigrant recently acquitted of a long-standing murder charge.


""Doing writing is not new for me, but doing it in a journalistic style is new,"" Wong said. ""Because of my legal background I was interested in the Chol Soo Lee trial and Simpson-Mazzoli, but I'm also really interested in community stuff, community events, social services, cutbacks and when they have fundraisers for different groups.""


She said she learned newswriting ""from scratch,"" spending time in the library, studying various texts to learn basic rules.


Wong has worked on two other freelance writing projects. She has written a book for young Asian girls and their motiers, answering questions covering a broad range of issues under the format of ""Dear Helen"" questions and answers. The book, under the sponsorship of Asian Women United, will be translated into Chinese and Korean. Wong has also worked with the Korean Community Center of East Bay on an introductory book on Asian Pacific women. Both books will be published early next year.


Although East/West is perhaps the most successful and well-known Chinese American newspaper in this country, Wong emphasized that it is a community publication with limited resources and only several full-time staff. But she says she is looking forward to working as associate editor.


She said she enjoys the excitement of ""staying in touch with everything that is happening in the community"" and keeping up with breaking stories. As a journalist, Wong said, she can keep atop the latest news developments, but ""you don't become mired in the political battles between different groups.""


And for Wong, moving from legal and social service work was not a difficult transition: ""I've always had the fantasy of being involved in media in some way.""

While the Chinese population was diffusing into areas outside Chinatown after World War II, Chinatown itself was undergoing significant changes. Available data indicates that the population of Chinatown, which had been increasing during the 1940's, reached a peak of 4,800 in 1950. Half of that number was Chinese. Since then, however, the population has steadily declined to approximately 1,200 persons.


One reason for the declining number of Chinese in Chinatown was the increasing residential mobility of the Chinese. Additionally, the Chinatown area had physically deteriorated, providing less attraction for people to live there. Most of the Chinatown buildings are now over 50 years old and very little rehabilitation or new construction has taken place. Many houses and apartments which surrounded the area have been torn down and replaced by light industries; others have closed because of failure to meet city building and fire codes. Chinatown presently has only a handful of houses. And, of 45 hotels and apartments in the area, less than half remain open.


The 1970 census reported only 408 Chinese in Chinatown, most of whom were recent immigrants or elderly. Within the last 30 years, an increasing number of Filipinos, Blacks, Whites, and to a lesser extent, American Indians, have moved into the area. In 1970, the median age of residents in the area was 58. About 40 per cent of the families and 60 per cent of the ""unrelated individuals"" lived below poverty. Chinatown had become a ghetto.


One of the most damaging blows to Chinatown or the International District, as it is also called, was construction of the Seattle Freeway (Interstate 5) along what is considered the eastern boundary of the District. The freeway, built in the 1960's, became a physical, social and psychological boundary, eliminating any continuity Chinatown once had with the area on the other side of the freeway. With the freeway forming the eastern edge of the District, growth of Chinatown was stymied since the only open direction for Chinatown to expand had been east.


As the years have passed, the Chinese who reside outside of the area have become less attached to it. Chinatown, however, still provides a shopping area for Asian goods and remains the focal point for many traditional cultural and social activities. Many Chinese have also retained some historical and ethnic identification with the area.


At the same time that the number of residents had declined. Chinatown has become more and more commercially oriented. Even with the loss of its Chinese population, the area still maintains much of its Chinese character. Nearly all the businesses in the present core of Chinatown -- a four-block area centered along King Street -- are owned and operated by Chinese. In fact, with the arrival of recent immigrants, Chinatown has witnessed somewhat of a revitalization; new Chinese business establishments have opened and old ones have expanded their clientele.


Diversity


It is becoming increasingly difficult to make generalizations about the Chinese in Seattle. Only two things can be said about them with any accuracy: one, they are a diverse ethnic group; and, two, they are far from successfully integrated or assimilated into Seattle's ""mainstream.""


The Chinese have never been a homogeneous group. The early Chinese immigrants were mostly male and workers, but there were also females and well-to-do merchants and labor contractors among them. There was factionalism and in-group conflict among the Chinese in the early days as well as now, although this conflict may not always have been in the open or readily apparent. All kinds of differences -- political, social, economic and cultural -- have existed among the Chinese as they have existed among other ethnic groups including Whites.


The increasing number of Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan has resulted in an increasing variety of Chinese lifestyles in this city.


There are five major groups of Chinese in Seattle: Hong Kong immigrants, Taiwan immigrants, Indochinese immigrants, elderly Chinese Americans and American-born Chinese. Each of these groups pursues a lifestyle based on its own social and cultural orientations. These lifestyles transcend economic or class lines. For Chinese, one's country of birth and cultural beliefs are more important than one's wealth in determining social relationships and cultural behavior.


Recent Hong Kong immigrants and the elderly Chinese Americans (some of whom were born and raised in this country and others of whom were born in China) share common beliefs and behavior based on the Confucian ethic and other cultural traits characteristic of Kwangtung Province. The difference between these two groups is that the elderly Chinese Americans have been here longer and are more familiar with American customs than the recent immigrants from Hong Kong, and have adopted some American ways. Each of these two groups generally tends to form friendships with members of their own group. And the recent Hong Kong immigrants speak the Sam Yup dialect while the elderly Chinese Americans speak the Sze Yup dialect.


The number of Taiwan immigrants is small and consists primarily of professionals -- professors, teachers and engineers. Significantly, they all speak Mandarin Chinese which is different from the Cantonese dialects spoken by the Hong Kong and elderly Chinese American groups. The mannerisms, eating habits and high educational level of this group also sets them apart from the other groups. Typically, there is very little social interaction between the Taiwan immigrants and the other Chinese Most of these Mandarin-speaking Chinese live in the north end of Seattle, away from the Beacon Hill and Rainier Valley areas where most other Chinese reside.


There is a growing number of recently arrived Chinese from Indochina, the majority of whom come from Vietnam, and they have formed their own associations. Their social interaction with the other groups is limited. Interestingly enough, it is not uncommon to find that many of them identify more as citizens of the country they left than as Chinese.


As Chinese immigrants become acculturated into American society, their behavior and values will more closely reflect those of the American-born Chinese.


Social-economic Status


Today, there are about 15,000 Chinese in Seattle, which represents a 250 per cent growth since 1970. Over half of the Chinese population is foreign-born.


Contrary to popular belief, it does not appear that Chinese have been economically successful. According to the 1970 census, the average family income of Chinese in the Seattle-Everett area was substantially lower than that of the general population. In fact, the median annual income in this area for Chinese males was the lowest among all groups.


Median Annual Income of Persons 16 Years or Older with Income by Race and Sex (1969)


                   Male     Female


Black             $6,011    $2,987


White              8,413     2,784


Japanese           7,859     3,105


Chinese            5,215     2,806


Filipino           5,286     3,281


Spanish            8,009     2,642


The 1970 census showed that seven per cent of Chinese families lived below the poverty level and 17.7 per cent were on welfare.


The largest category of Chinese workers was in the ""service"" area, reflecting the large number of Chinese working in the more than 100 Chinese restaurants in King County. The second largest category of Chinese workers was ""professionals.""


According to the census, the educational level of the Chinese in Seattle was 12.3 years, slightly higher than the average for the general population, which was 12.1. For Chinese, higher educational attainment has not led to higher income, suggesting that employment discrimination towards the Chinese as an ethnic group still persists.


Although this social-economic profile is based on 1970 census data, which is 12 years old, there is no reason to believe their status has improved relative to other groups. In fact, the status of Chinese as a group has probably declined relatively, because of the large number of immigrants whose educational level and incomes are lower than those of the average American.


Social Problems


A survey of non-English-speaking Chinese conducted in 1973 by the Chinese Information and Service Center, a local bilingual social service agency in Chinatown, revealed some major social problems within this group.


""The most pressing needs of the population,"" the report said, ""are in the areas of employment, English proficiency, housing, health care, and access to social services.""


But immigrants are not the only Chinese having difficulty; native-born Chinese face social problems as well, although of a different nature. As a racial minority, some native-born Chinese face problems of trying to establish a positive identity -- building self and group pride and just discovering who they are as Chinese Americans.


Mental health problems and employment discrimination are two major social problems for native-born Chinese. While statistics on mental illness among Chinese are not readily available, the records of the Asian Counseling and Referral Service, before the recent influx of Indochinese immigrants, revealed that their largest clientele was Chinese. Furthermore, statistics for the state of California show that Chinese have the highest rate of mental health institutionalization among all the ethnic groups, including Whites.


A survey in the late 1970's of Chinese employed in government found that all the agencies surveyed were underrepresented in the number of Chinese. The survey covered all levels of government from city to federal agencies. To date, no government agency in this state has employed a Chinese department head.


The Local Situation in Historical Context


The Chinese played a major role in the history of Seattle and Washington State, even though they were ill-treated because of their race and culture and suffered as victims of a depressed economy in earlier years.


Today, even though Chinese have not been fully incorporated into the mainstream of Seattle society, they are more tolerated than before and, to some extent, accepted by other groups.


The successful political campaigns of two Chinese Americans -- Ruby Chow and John Eng, elected as King County Council member and State Representative, respectively -- demonstrate that Chinese are making further gains.


The future of the Chinese in Seattle, however, remains unpredictable. Their history shows this. Changes in the national economy, international relationships or immigration policy could result in a change in public attitude toward the Chinese here.


For the Chinese, becoming part of the city and being accepted as Americans will be a two-way street. The Chinese must put forth an effort to be accepted by the Whites and other ethnic groups, and viceversa. But history shows that becoming a full beneficiary of all the city has to offer will be no easy task.

KRAB-FM, the Northwest's first and oldest listener-supported, non-commercial radio station, has revamped its program schedule, eliminating its Filipino and Laotian programs and reducing the air time of its Cantonese programs.


The station's Board of Trustees -- which recently instituted major cutbacks in foreign language programming, women's programming and international news -- has been accused by KRAB producers, and volunteers of abandoning KRAB's traditional commitment to providing community access programming as an alternative to commercial radio.


The Trustees, citing a declining number of subscribers and the need for more revenue to support the station's operation, changed the station's format from 24 hours a day to 12 hours a day, with new programming which includes a greater percentage of jazz, classical and new wave music.


KRAB is supported by subscribers who pay either $25 or $15 to become members enabling them to receive regular program guides.


In December, after a chaotic round of staff turnovers, the Trustees decided there wasn't money to continue to pay staff and moved into the role of managing the station themselves.


Libby Sinclair, a Trustee who is now serving as KRAB program director, noting that the number of subscribers has dwindled to 1,300, said the station needs at least 3,000 subscribers to survive. ""There was never any time to develop new programming and evaluate current programming,"" she said. ""The quality of programming just went down. We had to cut back and do a better job.""


But Stanford Smith, a member of the KRAB Producers Association, which opposes the actions of the Trustees, said, ""To attempt to raise money by a 40 to 50 percent cutback in air time is self-evidently absurd.""


The Trustees attempt to increase the number of members, he said, ""through old reruns and apolitical programming is pathetic and represents a retreat into commercialism in its worst sense.""


The Producers Association has criticized the Trustees for simultaneously holding positions as Trustees and as staff and has called for an independent audit of KRAB's finances. The Association has also called for greater minority representation on the Board of Trustees.


Sinclair explained that some of the foreign language programs were dropped in part because KRAB did not have persons to ""monitor"" the programs, as required by the Federal Communications Commission. The Cantonese and Spanish programs, she said, were retained ""partly on the basis of the large population size."" The Laotian program was dropped ""because a large number of Laotians speak Cantonese,"" she said. And she noted that several persons had complained about the content of the Filipino program, but she declined to go into specifics.


Producers and volunteers of the Filipino program, Tinig Ng Pilipino, the only regular Filipino language radio show in the Northwest, decided in a meeting earlier this month to request a meeting with the KRAB Trustees to find out why their program was shelved.


Art Ceniza, one of the producers of Tinig Ng Pilipino, said angrily, ""During the two weeks that the Board met to decide the new program format, they didn't even have the courtesy or decency to get in touch with the programs being cut. Never, in the seven years that Tinig has been on the air, have they talked to us in advance about any problems with how the program was formatted.


""It's a real insult, a slap in the face. There wasn't any due process. That's discriminatory and unprofessional.""


Dennis McWilliams, an English-As-A-Second-Language instructor at Seattle Central Community College, who helped produce the Laotian program, questioned KRAB's priorities under the new program format. The weekly Laotian program, produced by the Lao Lane Xang, provided news -- garnered from a variety of sources including the Seattle Times and a Lao newspaper in San Francisco -- music and discussions of the political situation in Laos.


""Why,"" McWilliams asked, ""is it more important to play several different kinds of music than it is to meet important social needs for the community?""


McWilliams said the Lao broadcast was the only one of its kind in Seattle. He said that if KRAB needed monitors for the foreign language programs there are community agencies that could have provided resources for that.


KRAB formerly offered two weekly Cantonese programs: an hourly Monday evening program, produced by the Chinese Media Committee; and a half-hour show early Saturday afternoon, produced by the Seattle Chinese Broadcast. Under the new schedule KRAB instituted at the beginning of March, both programs share a weekly Saturday, 5 to 6 p.m. time slot. Tentatively, each program will air on alternate Saturdays.


Karen Wong, a member of the Chinese Media Committee, said the new time slot is ""very undesirable."" She pointed out that a vast number of the former listeners to the Cantonese broadcast on Monday evening are restaurant and service workers who are at work on Saturdays from 5 to 6 p.m. and who will now be unable to listen to the program. Monday was an ideal time, she said, because that is the day off for most restaurant workers.


But Sinclair, who argued that KRAB's ""general audience is English-language-speaking,"" said the station had gotten complaints in the past from Monday evening listeners ""who wished that the Chinese program was on a different time because it was hard to go from an English language program to one hour of Chinese, before going back to English.


""I personally like to turn on sometimes and listen to the sound of the language but unfortunately a lot of people don't like the sound of the language,"" Sinclair said.


But Wong said, ""We think the listeners have many choices; they can turn to another station. If you cut an hour of classical music, for example, that doesn't have as much effect as if you cut an hour of Chinese. Our community relies on the program to get information.""


Looming above the controversy over programming changes is the decision of the KRAB Trustees to offer the station's 107.7 frequency for sale, which one producer termed ""a real underhanded process.""


When members of the KRAB Producers Association discovered, in the January 18 issue of Broadcasting magazine, an ad putting KRAB on the market, concern deepened over fundamental changes that might occur in the station's philosophy.


But Sinclair, remarking that the Board has been considering sale of the frequency for the past two years, said the sale would help stabilize the finances of the station. After the frequency is sold, KRAB could establish an endowment, move over to an educational frequency and settle its debts, she said. ""The frequency would change,"" she said, ""but the concept of providing non-commercial, educational programming would remain the same -- minus the financial crisis.""


But, from the viewpoint of critics such as Smith, the Trustees have already departed from KRAB's original concept. ""All programming that had the tendency to be politically sensitive was either cut back or eliminated"" he said.

The International District community will soon make several serious decisions about its future.


The International Special Review District (ISRD) Board, which oversees physical development in the District, is working on revision of its development regulations; the state is talking about Interstate 90 ending just south of the District; Metro is planning a transportation terminal either in or near our neighborhood; and the City is working on a land use plan for downtown.


The ISRD regulations are the controlling land use policy for the International District as long as the area remains a Special Review District. In the Fall of 1980, a series of community meetings were held to establish the goals and policies of the International District. These goals and policy statements were submitted to the City to be included in the downtown land use plan; from there, they became a draft of the revised development regulations.


The goals for the regulations are:


-- maintain and protect the International District as an Asian cultural, retail and residential center;


-- re-establish the District as a viable residential-commercial neighborhood by (1) providing housing for a residential population of 3,000 to 4,000; (2) promoting small businesses that cater to Asians; and (3) protecting the District from the proliferation of automobile traffic and parking.


The draft regulations, completed in December, 1981, attempt to implement the goals established. If you would like to review the regulations or have questions, contact Irene Hoskin, City staffperson to the Review Board at 625-4501.


The proposed I-90 extension is still in the design stage, the best time to provide input. The plan is to extend I-90 from where it currently ends, carrying general traffic to the Fourth Avenue and Royal Brougham area, and transit traffic to Fifth Avenue and Airport Way. The project would also bring transit traffic from northbound I-5 to Fifth Avenue and Airport Way. In viewing the alternatives, including a ""do nothing,"" alternative, the impacts on the International District must be assessed. For example, what will be the impact of changes in traffic patterns? Will our elderly pedestrians be safe crossing Fourth and Fifth Avenues? Will traffic congestion prevent emergency vehicles from reaching the International District in a timely manner? For further information or to give your comments on the project, contact William Garing at 764-4270.


Another factor that will affect traffic -- as well as parking -- is Metro's plan to build a transportation terminal to intercept diesel buses from suburban routes, Passengers will move from the buses to circulator vehicles to their downtown destinations. Metro is considering several sites: one to the south (at 4th Avenue and Royal Brougham), Union Station, King Stteet Station, and two northern sites (Fourth Avenue and Yesler Way). There are questions that need to be answered concerning traffic patterns, traffic congestion, impact on pedestrian traffic and District parking.


The City has embarked on an ambitious task: develop a comprehensive plan for downtown. Such a plan could abolish the concept of Special Districts. If the ID put all its energy into the ISRD regulation and none in the City-wide plan, the District may lose the community control it now enjoys.


These are a few examples of the land use issues facing the International District. When we look at the I-90 project and the proposed transportation terminal, it brings back visions of I-5, the Kingdome, the Port's plan for development of Union Station, the King County jail and proposed use of the Immigration and Naturalization Service building for a work release program. State and local governments are still trying to dump public projects ""that no one else wants"" in the ID. How much can we take before we are overcome?


It is the responsibility of each person concerned with the ID to examine the issues and their many facets; to decide what is important for the District and how to achieve or retain it; and to support the ID and inform our public officials of that support. We, as a community, have some decisions to make decisions about one future.

Kazuko Nakane, a Seattle writer, is involved in a project that will tell the story of the Issei in Watsonville, California, from the early years of immigration, through the internment years, to the present.


""In Japan, Issei are considered American, treated a little different,"" says Nakane. ""In the United States, Nisei and Sansei consider Issei to be very Japanese, a link with Japan and the tradition, while white people just think they are Japanese, that's all. I want to break down all the stereotypes and preconceptions about the Issei.""


The prevalent image of Issei has remained one of racial stereotypes, distinctly ""non-American"" to whites. Nakane says the way to change this is to educate people on the Issei's particular achievements in the United States; the most visible and important achievement is in agriculture.


""I was talking to a Sansei once,"" says Nakane, ""and I made the comment that the Issei had made a large contribution to agriculture in America. He turned to me and said. Oh, really? This person really did not know. I thought this was very sad. I think it is very important for people to know what the Issei did in this country.""


Nakane's project is titled Issei Oral History Project in Watsonville, California. It will be an historical report, compiled from research and personal interviews of Issei, most of whom are now in their 80's. It will include short, personal histories based on these interviews.


Watsonville is a small farming community, with a large Chicano and small Asian population, near Santa Cruz. Most Japanese Americans there were farmers. The main crop was strawberries, the least desirable crop, requiring hard labor. Lettuce and tomatoes were also grown. Because of the Alien Land Law, Issei could not own land to farm, so many people were share farmers, farming on someone else's land and sharing expenses and profits. Later, as Nisei reached legal age, the Issei bought land in their children's name.


Watsonville developed a small Japan-town, with stores carrying goods and food from Japan, Japanese movies, and Japanese language schools for the children. Chinatown offered gambling and prostitution houses to bachelors and others desiring such entertainment. There were Japanese Buddhist and Christian churches, Japanese associations, and Japanese-run farmers cooperatives.


During World War II, Japanese Americans in Watsonville suffered exclusion from businesses, and rocks were thrown through their windows. When the time came to evacuate, most were sent to the relocation camp in Poston, Arizona. Some moved to the Midwest or East. After the war, those who returned immediately to Watsonville suffered again from discrimination. Within a few years, racist attitudes had died down somewhat. Many returned but many did not.


The Issei in Watsonville come from vacious backgrounds and occupations. Some were farmers, had businesses and some were well educated coming to the United States to continue their education. One such man became disillusioned when he found himself excluded from all institutions. Many people had visions of wealth education and freedom in America. One woman when she saw the old wooden house she was to live in could not believe it was so. She thought all houses in America were made of brick and stone.


In 1978, Nakane took a class in Asian American Studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The class planned an Issei Oral History Project and Nakane, who could speak fluent Japanese, conducted the interviews. After Nakane had conducted several interviews with Issei, the other class members lost interest in the project. Nakane felt an obligation to finish the project, at least for the Issei interviewees who were expecting something to come out of the interviews.


""I would like to publish the article, says Nakane, to have something to give the interviewees. I want to make this information available to anyone else who is interested -- their families, especially the younger people, and other doing research in the same area. A special library at UC Santa Cruz has said it will keep the finished article in its archives. But I would like to make it more easily available for everyone.


Unfortunately, Nakane has no funding to finish the project. The initial funding from UC Santa Cruz has been spent, and Nakane has not located any other funding sources. She is relying on her own income to continue, and thus it will take some time. In March she plans to return to California to conduct more interviews and do further research.


""I feel very close to these Issei, because I have had a similar experience,"" she said. ""I am a new immigrant to the United States, and it has taken me six years to feel I am a part of America. Always I have felt on the edge. People in Japan treat me a little different, and people here in the states treat me like I am from Japan. I am very much a marginal citizen. I think this is what it was like for the Issei, and therefore I can understand them.

Thirty-seven years ago this month, World War II came to a sudden halt after the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This June 12, a Japanese delegation of 1,500 flew to New York to participate in what turned out to be the largest single demonstration in American history and to present the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament with two-and-a-half tons of paper bearing signatures from half the population of Japan, calling for world disarmament.


Among the delegation were 150 hibakusha, victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Another 150 were detained in Tokyo, allegedly because they were associated with Communists. The hibakusha were old and ill, but on June 12, they were driven to the front of the marchers so they could walk the final steps, leading approximately one million marchers into Central Park.


The marchers came from Canada, Australia, all over Europe as well as the four corners of the United States. Marchers came down from Harlem, up from Chinatown, across the Brooklyn Bridge, and from the posh apartments on nearby Park Avenue.


Many never set foot in the Park, let alone get within sight of the stage where entertainers and politicians spoke and performed for six straight hours. The speakers ranged from Orson Welles to Jill Clayburgh, from Abbie Hoffman to The Rev. Ben Chavis, from Rita Marley to Bella. Abzug, from Barry Commoner to a variety of people from Congress. And the media was there to stalk the celebrities, not to cover the demonstration or the reasons that so much of humanity had gathered to show President Reagan that Americans will not accept the nuclear buildup, nuclear warfare, or even nuclear power.


One of the hibakusha kept saying that victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were only the beginning, and that hibakusha are everywhere: including Three Mile Island workers and the Navajo whose land is being stripmined for uranium to build nuclear bombs.


The sole Asian American speaker at the New York demonstration was Dr. Michio Kaku, a nuclear physicist for disarmament and former University of California at Berkeley and Harvard student activist. Kaku said that President Richard Nixon's plan to end the Vietnam War was to drop an atomic bomb on Hanoi, but it did not happen because 200,000 people demonstrated in the Nation's capital. ""There's one thing the U.S. military fears the most,"" said Kaku, ""the American people. The American people will decide again.""


It took some effort for one million people to gather in Central Park. It was more of a celebration when 50,000 gathered in San Francisco in a simultaneous demonstration. And it was great entertainment for the 100,000 who went to the Rose Bowl stadium the previous week for a peace concert led by Stevie Wonder, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt. But, it was a real major effort for the 1,500 to come from Japan, stepping foot on the land of the nation which defeated Japan and which dropped bombs killing millions of innocent people and leaving many permanently ill from the radiation. Despite early day proclamations by Reagan officials discounting the demonstration, the demonstration had to have an effect. If it didn't, Seattleites should not rest easy knowing that this beautiful area is Target 1 and that nobody will survive. Peace demonstrations and activism are no longer things to be left to pacifists and hippies. It's a matter of life and death for all of us.


Former Seattleite Sharon Maeda covered the June 12 demonstration in New York for Pacifica Radio, where she is the Executive Director of the five station network of listener-sponsored radio stations. Pacifica Radio, founded in 1946 to create international understanding and peace broadcast the entire demonstration live from New York and San Francisco on the public radio satellite.

With its many ethnic restaurants; the International District is practically the last place one would expect to find a fast food restaurant. That will no longer be true in late September or early October. No, McDonald's is not moving in; ""A Little Bit from the East"" is.


A Little Bit From the East will be a fast food restaurant, but it's no comparison to McDonald's, says Kenford Yee, co-owner of the new restaurant. The fast food restaurant will offer about 25 menu items, mainly Chinese and Japanese dishes.


He admits the fast food restaurant will be similar to Uwajimaya's deli counter, but he distinguishes the two. ""It's like you're shopping at Uwajimaya and you also have food,"" Yee noted. He says that A Little Bit From the East will be solely devoted to fast, good food in a comfortable atmosphere.


Yee and Mark Nagasawa, the other co-owner of the venture, believe there is a need for a fast food restaurant in the ID even though nearby restaurants offer reasonably priced food and relative ease in ordering food to go.


""It'll be totally different from a full service restaurant because we're inexpensive,"" Yee explained. Prices at the new restaurant will run from about two dollars to $4.50, with the average price of a meal being about three dollars.


""It's the only place in the ID that will have Chinese and Japanese food,"" Yee continued, adding that the rice served will be half Chinese rice and half Japanese rice.


A Little Bit From the East will open daily at 6 a.m. to serve commuters who park under the freeway. Breakfast will be American food. Nagasawa said there is really no place for commuters to meet in the morning, so the new restaurant will fulfill this need.


""A lot of places (in the ID) have good food and efficient service but there's not that many fun places,"" Yee commented. ""We want to be more involved with the people that come in."" They plan to mingle with the customers as well as help in the kitchen. ""We don't want to be a hangout, but we would like to cater to a younger crowd. We're the only young restaurant owners down here.""


Nagasawa and Yee are both in their 20's, but they have considerable restaurant and management experience. Nagasawa was a manager at Uwajimaya and had worked at its stores for thirteen-and-a-half years. Yee had been with the Hong Kong Restaurant for at least 13 years, working his way up from dishwasher to manager. He had also worked at the Renton Sheraton Hotel.


""We're open for suggestions on anything,"" Yee said, ""except location."" The menu will consist of rice and udon dishes and whatever is fresh and available. Monosodium glutamate, an ingredient widely used in Asian restaurants, will not be used at the fast food restaurant, for healthier eating. The menu will also include different types of burgers such as tonkatsu burgers, teriyaki burgers, and cha-sui burgers.


Depending on the success of the fast food restaurant, Nagasawa and Yee may establish franchises around Seattle and perhaps beyond the area.


Meanwhile, they're planning to make their restaurant a fun place. A large screen TV will be installed. A bulletin board in front of the restaurant will inform patrons of events in the community.


Beer and wine will be available to those of age. The 40 to 45 person capacity restaurant will be located at 668 South Weller, across from Sun Ya Restaurant. A Little Bit from the East will be open daily from 6 a.m. to 8 or 9 p.m., serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. The lunch and dinner menus will be the same. Phone orders may be called in ahead of time at 223-1515.


The architect of the restaurant is Bob Kovalenko and the general contractor is Gordy Asai. Nagasawa and Yee are building the restaurant themselves.

The exhibition, ""In China: Photographs by Eve Arnold,"" will be shown at Seattle's Museum of History and Industry, February 8 through March 28. The 104 color photographs of the life, work and people of modern China were taken by renowned photojournalist, Eve Arnold.


The exhibition was organized by The Brooklyn Museum and is on a two-year nationwide tour made possible by a grant from Exxon. Patrick Cardon, administrator for curatorial affairs at The Brooklyn Museum, said, ""Eve Arnold gave us an important exhibition which reflects her sensitivity to human endeavors as well as her excellence as a photographer. This exhibition had to be seen around the country.""


Arnold -- whose assignments have included protest marches in the American South, Hollywood movie queens, harems in Abu Dhabi and migrant farm workers -- has focused her camera on the China not normally visited by foreigners. She made two trips to China in 1979, traveling nearly 40,000 miles.


On her first trip, Eve Arnold worked in places frequented by many Westerners -- Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Suzhou, Guilin, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Wuhan. Her second trip took her to far more remote areas such as Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xishuangpanna on the Burmese border, Xinjiang in the northwest and Qingdao on the east coast.


""My intention,"" she says, ""was to make a statement about the lives of the people, to try to get a sense of the sustaining character beneath the surface. I wanted to get beyond the endless blue suits and bicycles we've been seeing pictures of for so many years, and to tell the story in color.""


She was one of the first American photographers permitted to roam the interior of that ancient land. ""The results,"" said the New York Times, ""include the most appealing faces since Steichen's ""Family of Man exhibit.""


The exhibition has been a crowd-pleaser in each of its locations since it opened in Brooklyn in November, 1980. According to the director of the China Trade Museum near Boston, Mrs. Betty W. Hirsch. ""The Eve Arnold exhibit was our most popular exhibition. In the eight weeks that it was here we tripled our attendance."" In the past six months, it has been well received in both San Francisco and Portland.


The 104 photographs in the exhibit are also included in her book. In China, published by Knoft, which contains 170 color plates.


As Ms. Arnold puts it, ""China is not all blue Sun Yat Sen country. There are cowboys, bathing beaches, practicing Muslims, modern cityscapes, giant billboards, even Pierre Cardin displaying his models on the Great Wall.""


The Museum of History and Industry is open free to the public, Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays, 12 noon to 5 p.m. During the In China, exhibition, there will be lectures and special children's activities at the Museum as well. For further details, call 324-1125.

""People did what they wanted with me during my military service -- my body, my mind, my efforts,"" reflected Larry Wong, an Asian Vietnam-era veteran. ""Now, I'm going to do what I have to do for me.""


Wong, born in Yakima and raised in the International District and Seattle, has been an artist, writer, poet, singer, actor, and restaurant manager. He helped start one of the first Asian theatrical troupes in Seattle.


While attending the University of Washington in 1966, Wong decided to enlist in the Marine Corps. ""My thoughts at the time I joined the Marine Corps were: 'I'm not doing well in school so I might as well get my military obligations out of the way,'"" explained Wong. ""But when I first told my dad (stepfather), he cried. Maybe he knew something I didn't. I thought I was bad or did something wrong.""


Wong spent ""13 months and 8 hours"" as an electronic technician in Vietnam. His unit flew planes and helicopters, supporting ground troops.


""When I first arrived at Da Nang at night,"" said Wong, ""we were being rocketed. It was February, 1968, the beginning of the Tet offensive. The night was like a starry sky -- only the stars were rockets. The next day I saw all these translucent bags on the ground and didn't know what they were there for. I found out later they were body bags.""


Bombings we frequent, about three times a week. They were trying to bomb helicopters located next door to us,"" he said. ""I remember an explosion and an instantaneous rush out the doors, with or without clothes. The only lights were glowing cigarette butts. I'd think to myself. The people out there are trying to hurt you. I don't know why -- maybe because we're there trying to hurt them.


It was strange to see the land torn up by fighting. Wong remembers the long, flat rice paddies, surrounded by huge craters, and he recalls vast areas of productive farmlands turned into barren sand. The military rationale was to eliminate hiding places.


Wong contrasted the Vietnam War with other American wars: ""Fighting the American Revolution was our business. We knew who we were fighting and why --we didn't want some outsider to tell us how to live in our own country. But fighting the Vietnam War -- people at home were mad at us; the Vietnamese native's loyalty went to whoever was victorious at the time. There was no reason or goal to justify the destruction, and it still continues to elude me.


""In retrospect we were part of a historical mistake. At the time. I'm sure policymakers believed they were doing the right thing.""


Wong feels guilty about providing support for the war effort and being a witness to the ""games"" played. ""I saw kickbacks -- guys making a buck from the war,"" Wong said. ""We weren't liberating the Vietnamese. The war was just an economic game to try out Agent Orange and make a profit.""


The government committed a grave crime, he said, when it discharged Vietnam-ear veterans without deactivating them. ""I had applied for a hardship discharge because my stepfather had died and my mom was all alone,"" Wong recalled, ""When I was discharged in September 1969, it was real quick -- within 24 hours I was back on American streets.""


Wong worked as a chemical specialist for Boeing, doing assembly-line work. But he found this job, like the military, too regimented and confining. Also, he found it hard to adjust to American life. After 13 months of hearing rockets and bombs, especially in the middle of the night, Wong jumped when he heard a car backfire or when his mother would try to wake him up.


In the 1970's, Wong experienced the delayed-stress syndrome, psychological and emotional disturbances arising after Vietnam-era veterans have seemingly adjusted to civilian life. ""I'd work six months and rest six months,"" he said. ""I didn't want to live like this anymore, just drifting and being depressed. Maybe something was affecting me and causing this restlessness that I wasn't even aware of. That's scary, not to be in control.""


After reading about similar emotional disturbances of other Vietnam-era veterans, Wong went to the Vietnam Veterans Outreach Center in Seattle at 1322 East Pike and talked to veterans-turned-counselors. He said it was difficult, as an Asian, to go to someone for mental help because Asians have a great deal of pride about being mentally strong and are very private. ""But the Veterans Center saved my life,"" he remarked. ""They helped me open up and talk about it. A Year ago I wouldn't have talked to you. I'd be hiding out in my bunker.""


Wong attended the Veteran Center's ""rap group"" for 16 weeks. After the session ended, he and other Vietnam-era veterans formed ""The Old Timers Group."" The group meets at different homes. Wong emphasized: ""It's our own personal development thing ... away from federally-funded bureaucracy."" They have talked through their problems, which will never totally go away, and now are planning a business venture -- a sign of getting on with life, he said.


""I feel like I've lost some time and I want to accelerate my growth,"" explained Wong. ""I'm ready to go back to the 9 to 5, Monday-through-Friday routine so I can go back to singing gigs. My game plan is to be at the peak of health, both physically and mentally, by April, 1982.


If you're an Asian American vet and would like to talk about your experiences, call Larry at 323-3559.

A eulogy is a poor substitute for a tribute to the living. It's too little and too late, the survivors survive and the dead are soon forgotten.


A minister stands before the congregation stating obvious and general things about a person he might not have known. At its worst, the ceremony is an elaborate trivialization. No one hears this liturgical Muzak. Each head is bowed, but truer tributes to the dead are held in private. At a funeral, it is too soon to summarize the meaning of a life.


Years ago, I couldn't do it for a friend. I believe that I'm ready now. My eulogy will be public and on paper because his life in so many ways, was both public and admirable.


I do not believe our friendship shall cloud my judgment. But if it does. I don't care.


He had his flaws. There was the Sunday morning stench of stale, cheap wine and cigarettes which clung to a visitor's clothing threatening to seep under the skin. It never seemed to leave, not even by Monday.


The main room of his Chinatown apartment was small and perpetually cluttered. As always, he sat on a chair on the far side by the window, facing the door. From that spot, he rarely moved.


There was an adjoining bedroom, but I never saw him use it. Years ago, he lost a leg in an accident. I wondered if the effort to transfer from one room to the other was sometimes too much, and he'd spend the night asleep in the chair. He was sitting when I met him ten years ago.


""Hello, Manong Chris,"" I said.


His last name was Mensalvas, and I had heard of him on different occasions. My mother told me he was a Communist, but added that he was also a nice man. Dad agreed. And for them both -- the most non-ideological of souls -- the latter trait was more important than political nuances.


They were right. I sensed that immediately.


He smiled as I walked over to shake his hand. He liked my father, he said, and knew him from the cannery days. And yes, he had heard about the proposed suit against King County and would gladly be a plaintiff.


We talked a bit more, but mostly I just listened and watched. He was a small man. As he sat there with an empty pant leg dangling, he appeared even smaller than he was. His white hair was combed back gangster style, in a fashion common decades earlier. The pomade was gone, but the hair still curved backward, a victim of persistent training.


He was well over 60, that much was evident. His face was smooth and golden brown, and his eyes, slanted slightly, were almost Chinese. When he laughed, which was often, they'd sometimes disappear.


Anyone familiar with romantic pulp realizes that a description of a person's eyes borders dangerously on triteness. Yet, the risk is worthwhile because his eyes were beautiful, conspicuously and unavoidably so. It was not because of any physical characteristic. Rather, it was the life and intelligence in those eyes which bid a stranger welcome.


After an hour or so, I left but promised to return and bring more information about the impending action. He would be a plaintiff suing King County on behalf of a class. The class consisted of the residents of Chinatown, and the suit was an effort to stop the construction of the proposed Domed Stadium. The Dome was to be built nearby. People feared that the rise in the surrounding property values would result in the closure of Chinatown's low-income residential hotels.


That year (1972) I was a 21 year old first year law student, serving as a liaison between the legal team and the residents of the area. We eventually lost and if I'd been older, it wouldn't have surprised me. It was, after all, the dissent of a handful of aging Filipinos against the power of the County. It was hardly a fair fight.


I suspect that's why he laughed. He'd never been in a fair fight, or even had that luxury. And compared to what he'd faced in earlier years -- the beatings, jailings, and attempted deportations -- this bout with the County was, by comparison, a waltz in the garden.


At his age, what mattered most was the chance to joust, whatever the outcome. He could have told me that we were going to lose, but he didn't. And besides, he enjoyed the attention.


When I visited Chris a couple of days later, he was no longer alone. He was sitting with another old Filipino, similar to him in size and complexion, but dressed only in his underwear. The other old man sat unnaturally, stiff and upright, while Chris held a tiny shot glass gently to his friend's lips. He sipped a drop or two of the whiskey, but could not move his head back to gulp the remainder down. Chris was patient, almost maternal, as he coaxed his friend.


""Hello,"" Chris said as I eased into a chair opposite both of them.


""This is Mat Lagunillia, a friend of mine. He's had a stroke.""


Mat was in bad shape, that much was obvious. He was largely immobilized and unable to speak.


""Mat,"" Chris said cheerfully, ""will also join the suit. Won't you, Mat?""


With great effort Lagunillia nodded slightly in apparent agreement.


This time, I had brought certain legal papers, among them authorization forms which permitted the attorneys to sue on behalf of the signatories. I handed one to Chris. He looked at it, read it slowly, and gave the first one to Mat. Chris also gave him a pen and book upon which he placed his authorization form.


""Sign it, Mat,"" Chris said.


He did, and to this day, I don't know how. He was half-dead, or at least he wasn't quite alive. And he held that pen crudely, like a child with a crayola learning to write. Yet, somehow he retained enough of himself to stab and scrawl and scribble his name on that piece of paper.


Chris later told me that Mat returned to the Philippines, and I knew what he meant. But ""return"" is a euphemism that has little to do with returning and everything to do with dying. As so many have done before him, Mat returned to die. And in a sense, his ravaged condition was a disguised blessing. Death was quick. He didn't have to explain his poverty and his apparent failures to relatives anxious to know of the world he had left.


When Mat finally and mercifully died, Chris showed me a snapshot he had received of the funeral. In the middle was old Mat in repose, like the statues of saints who always look piously upward.


""This is Mat,"" Chris said succinctly and without emotion, ""dead as a doorknob.""


It's a Filipino custom to take pictures of the dead. And in my own experience, I've seen more pictures of doorknobs than pictures of living relatives. For American tastes, it seems a bit macabre to remember the departed by Polaroid. But on the other hand, it isn't any more so than to forget the living. Because at one point, Chris and Mat were alive and living badly, and forgotten by the Community they helped to create.


The Community was the umbrella organization for all other organizations. It served as the official representative for Filipinos in Seattle. Headquartered in a former bowling alley on Empite Way, it resembles, to this day, a bowling alley on Empire Way. Silk purses from the ears of sows, perhaps?


On Saturday night, members danced at the bowling alley, and on Sunday evenings, they played bingo. While on certain Sunday afternoons -- the first one of each month -- they held Community Council meetings. The members of the Council were the more prominent fish in a very small pond.


The groups on those special Sunday afternoons were mixed, to say the least. A few were short and comical hamsterlike creatures who scurried frenetically between tables. Their most fervent Sunday wish was simply to prevent gossip from including their names.


Most, however, were not as insecure, or if they were, did not display it publicly on the Lord's day. And some were good, even admirable people.


There were those, however, who were neither admirable, nor insignificant, nor harmlessly silly. They were hard and powerful, and some made their living being harder and more powerful than the men they robbed. They were union officials, and in those days, a few were particularly notorious for accepting kickbacks from workers dispatched to the Alaskan canneries.


On those Sunday afternoons, they sat with their legs crossed, impeccable and polished, in suits that could shine even in the afternoon light.


From the first drop of the gavel until the final pointless speech, the meetings were dominated by key elements of the grand Filipino oratorical style, i.e., exaggeration, gesticulation, slander, and perspiration.


In particular, one of the union men favored this approach and used it -- in equal portion -- to alternately praise himself and condemn his enemies. Of them all, he was the most sinister, and certainly the most obnoxious.


In those distant days, his star was high within the union and the Community Pompadoured and slick, he wore his blue-black mane plastered against the sides of his head. The mixture of grease and hair was so thick, no ordinary comb could ever penetrate, much less navigate, successfully. It was bullet proof, or appeared that way. From the back, his head resembled a dark medieval turret, strangely out of place in a bowling alley on Empire Way.


Whenever I'd mention Turret Head and the others, Chris would begin a long train of slurred invectives, each more horrendous than the preceding. This train, unlike most trains, pulled out on time every time. Half drunk, he'd spit those words into the air, stumbling over letters as he raced to throw them all out.


What he said was true. Turret Head and his friends were bad adjectives. But for the old man, their repugnance cut a special slice -- painful, thin, and invisible to most eyes.


They were traitors. That's what he really meant. And as traitors, they left no sign of their work. There was no wound or blood, just damage.


But betrayers of what? His union, ILWU Local 37, something he loved more than a little.


If, at one time he'd been important to the Community, he was double that to his union. He was its parent, teacher and nag. And over the course of decades, he guided, coaxed and scolded the concept of unionization into the minds of Filipino workers. His friend and countryman, the author Carlos Bulosan, said that Chris was the best Filipino organizer. He was right.


Chris had seen it all -- tentative organizational efforts, an early independent union, and subsequently, affiliations with powerful internationals. The ILWU -- the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union -- was the last of the line.


With the anti-Red hysteria of World War II, most of organized labor shied away from Filipino unionists. For example, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which had previously backed the Seattle local, suddenly withdrew its membership.


Into the breach came Harry Bridges and his Longshoremen. It was a militant and tough organization, and Bridges -- if he wasn't a Communist, as he subsequently claimed -- gave a persuasive impersonation.


It was a perfect match at an imperfect time. The McCarthy era devastated the Left, and the ensuing years witnessed historic legal and political battles. For Chris and his union, the times were particularly hard, and Local 37 was particularly vulnerable. As aliens, Filipino members were subject to deportation for ""improper"" political affiliations.


Yet, somehow he and he union survived it all -- the harassment, the arrests, and the subsequent court fights. All that remains of that turbulent time are the survivors, their largely unwritten history and a long list of bitter court cases with innocuous names.


It wasn't as if the Local was red throughout. The ideology of the rank and file was never uniform. Some, I am certain couldn't tell Groucho Marx from Karl a distant relation. The bottom line for many was that Chris understood them and their needs and spoke their language.


That was his magic. He could speak to anyone, and that person would believe, or want to believe. Like a mathematician, he always found the common denominator. It was that rare, slender isthmus of language where the same words spoken -- sometimes by strangers -- had the same meaning.


His talent -- that human touch -- worked in spite of his ideology, not because of it. He was an orthodox Communist, a Stalinist to be exact.


It's a bankrupt political belief. In defending Stalin's record, any apologist faces inherent difficulties, not the least of which is the domestic horrot of the Russian past.


Yet. Chris was a Stalinist. Ideologically, he abhorred the great infidelity -- Trotskyism -- and had little patience for Social Democracy, Maoism, or other deviations. Nevertheless, his friends included Catholics -- lapsed and active -- Maoists, pseudo Maoists, an occasional Democrat, and a wide array of political agnostics.


With no small pride, he once told me that he had held his card for decades, and that Bulosan was also a long-time Party member. Small wonder really. In those early days, only the Communists supported the aspirations of Filipino labor.


It's hard to explain his loyalty. During the 1950's, he could have renounced his ideology, and opted for a far easier existence. Some of his associates did, but Chris faced the maelstrom and held firm. I can only suggest that it is the best of Filipino traits to never abandon those who give you shelter. And for my money. Chris Mensalvas was the best of Filipinos.


I can imagine what he was like in years past, because even at that age and in that stage of deterioration he could reach you. He'd glide past the defenses of cynicism and logic that the young are afflicted with -- these he'd evade with embarrassing ease -- and speak to your heart. It was an uncomfortable conversation made without the listener's permission, but made nevertheless.


There was one day in particular when this one legged Merlin was at his best, conjuring with words what incantations could never achieve. We were drinking, but not drunk. Suddenly, he started speaking in absurdities -- non-sequiturs and gross exaggerations.


He was the man of faith, and I the infidel. His passion to my logic, and unfortunately, the latter was not home, having sallied forth to guard against a foe which had already passed.


That's the danger of wine with old men. Sometimes, they don't recognize the accepted rules of order. Or if there's recognition, it's selective at best. Unlike the young, the old conform the rules to their lives, not the reverse.


So we sat there, his passion and my rules. It was a confrontation of sorts, but hardly a contest.


Chris started innocuously enough -- a comment that Seattle and its politics were insignificant items on any non-local scale. I readily agreed. He then continued, stating that there were other, fargreaten struggles occurring elsewhere. He wanted, he said, to go to the Philippines to fight Ferdinand Marcos, that nation's dictator. And he wanted me to take him.


Of course, the proposal was ludicrous -- an old cripple and a boy in the demon's lair. I laughed. But then I looked at him straight, and could tell he was serious.


I wanted to say yes, but I didn't. Instead, I couched my answer in the newly acquired skill of legal caveats, featuring a liberal usage of ""maybe,"" ""perhaps,"" and ""but.""


He sensed my hesitation, and gracefully accepted the response, what response there was. For my sake, he drank some more. The extra alcohol took its normal course, blurring our conversation, and consigning his original proposal to an impermanent oblivion.


Chris, I am sure, would have been more than happy to die in the Philippines. It was better than rotting in that chair in his room. He would have died for something he believed in -- a consistent end to a consistent life. He called, and I wasn't ready. And to this day, I don't know if much has changed.


I returned to my world, which was far safer than the one he proposed to enter. After that point, my visits came less frequently. And when they did, he seemed more haggard than the time before.


In 1974, I finally graduated from law school, and invited Chris to the commencement. Prior to the ceremony. I stopped by to pick him up. He couldn't make it. ""Gout,"" he said.


He'd been drinking, and his good foot hurt too much. It was like that the last few years. Age, alcohol, and, I think, the onset of despair were finally taking their toll.


There is a misleading version of the last days of old men: the spry old fighter sitting weary after countless bouts, but courageous, chipper, and coherent until the end. It's a nice image, and sometimes it even happens. But the last days of Chinatown's poor are often not like that.


Chris was an old man, confined to a chair for most of the day, the smell of wine and nicotine on his breath. And what was worse was that he realized his people had forgotten, or never knew. Even those who should have remembered, had chosen to forget whatever it was they once stood for.


He'd been dead several years, his last breath drawn in a fire in his apartment. He was trapped, I suspect, as much by his condition and his past, as he was by the flames and smoke.


Dead as a doorknob.


Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, the cycle continues. The survivors survive, and the dead are soon forgotten. It's an eternal process, as natural as the summer sky. But even in nature, there is loss and sometimes mourning. Yet, the fear of death often causes a premature rush from the dead, in pell mell fashion, forgetting too soon the meaning of a life well lived.


Those who knew him and have chosen to forget, have lost the most. And what have they lost? A sense of vision which, for Chris, was greater than himself. The dream was terribly flawed, as was he. But he clutched it, dreamer that he was, from the first day until his last.


In the days of our colonizers, the Philippines was a dangerous place -- a land of incessant and futile revolt. Its inhabitants were dangerous because they dreamed dangerous dreams.


In this city, among his people, that trait has vanished, the victim of a trade -- a sense of vision for immediacy and comfort. To his credit, it's an exchange the old man never made.


Rest well, Manong Chris.

In 1942 when all Japanese Americans on the West Coast were herded into hastily built concentration camps under Executive Order 9066 those who were artists kept recording their surroundings with sensitivity and wit.


The camp at Topaz, Utah seemed to have more than its share of artist setting up activities. The respected artist and professor in art, from the University of California at Berkeley, Chira Obata would write, ""No light-bulb, no stove, in a field where even the earth froze"" in 1942 and depict in simple inkwash a family huddled on bunk beds with army blankets their only protection from the cold.


San Francisco artist Hisako Hibi remembers how they set up art classes, especially for the children to take their minds off the sense of gloom pervading the area. In January of 1944, she would paint a gray slate sky sweeping over the roofs of barracks covered in last night's snowfall, a lone figure with an umbrella struggling in the fore-ground while the wind carries her feet.


Perhaps the most well-known artwork to come out of those camps was the work of Mine Okubo who did over two thousand drawings and paintings that were compressed into an honest and biting camp diary published as Citizen 13660.


And here in 1982 the tradition seems to continue in the paintings of Roger Shimomura, a Sansei trying to depict in paintings the diary of his grandmother Toku. Like many families from this area, the Shimomuras spent the war years in Minidoka, Idaho. Done in the style of Ukioye, a Japanese school of woodblock printing and painting used to depict the pleasurable lifestyle of 18th and early 19th centuries, the paintings are immediately familiar and one finds them easily attractive since we already have the Japanese model in our mind.


Shimomura tries to use this style for his own purpose, however. He seems to blow up the woodblock image and push the space full with pattern and figures. The design and texture of kimono are beautifully depicted as they swirl and converge, traditional patterns juxtaposed with more pop art ones give the decorative field a quiet, yet pulsating sense of color and rhythm. As one looks closely, we see the vestiges of American camp life cropping up in the tiny details of each diary entry. A kimono-clad courtesan holds up a bowl filled not with rice or noodles, but wieners. The disgruntled expression on her face gives away her opinion of camp food.


Shimomura is a master of technique, he has studied the forms well and the clean elegant construction and the use of flat colors give each entry a pleasing decorative quality. He has tried to undermine this by his usage of American motif. In the entry depicting his grandmother listening to the news of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, we see a modern radio on the shelf. In many other pieces the sense of confinement is hovering in the background, with the motif of taut strands of barbed wire forming a continual pattern of its own.


More often than not, I found his strategy of using modern motifs to subvert the form not altogether successful. They were too subtle and the Japanese form still tended to dominate the mood, so much that if you took away the captions and titles and displayed the paintings in Japan, I'm afraid many people would not be able to discern the difference as being distinctly American.


When Shimomura challenges his form and uses it for his own means, the paintings can be quite effective. I particularly enjoyed the entry for December 12, 1941 which reads, ""I spent all day at home. Starting from today we were permitted to withdraw $100 from the bank. This was for our sustenance of life, we who are enemy to them. I deeply felt America's large heartedness in dealing with us."" Whether his grandmother was being sarcastic or sincere is not completely clear but the artist invokes the perfect dash of satire with silhouette of Superman behind a shoji screen as his grandmother remains seated at her Japanese table daydreaming.


Another piece that I liked was the mess half Christmas. Once again behind a shoji screen, we see the animated shadows of people eating and enjoying their Christmas. To their left, we see the figure of Santa Claus half revealed and half in shadow as his jaunty figure is caught in motion about to enter the messhall.


Another artist who was moved in a direction similar to Shimomura is the Japanese artist Masa mi Teraoka who presently lives in California. He also uses the woodblock form as a traditional backdrop, but has managed a more dramatic metamorphosis into personal vision. In his series, McDonald's Hamburgers Invading Japan, we see a tattooed woman devouring a bowl of noodles as a geisha comes in tempting her with a Big Mac.


In another series, New Views of Mt Fuji/La Brea Tar Bits and Rental Boat, Teraoka depicts a traditionally dressed couple with tripod and camera set up on their boat trying to get a close up of a suddenly awakened mastadon emerging from the pits at La Brea. The absurdity of vision and juxtaposition of tradition thrown in the blender of Western influence makes for an interesting artistic milk shake.


In another 'direction, California painter Ben Sakoguchi uses the agricultural tradition of orange crate label art, duplicates the form but changes the motifs for his own and convincingly makes something familiar work as a vehicle for personal expression. Through a series of 76 small paintings, he puts the Japanese American internment experience and the atrocities of the Vietnam War into something the viewer can grasp on an emotional as well as an artistic level.


Shimomura should by no means imitate either artist, but he might do well by observing how they managed to take a dominant motif or form and transpose it so thoroughly that they make the form work for them, rather than being overshadowed by tradition.


In a sense, this is Shimomura's most successful show to date simply because he has tried to undermine the traditional form he works with more than ever before. Yet, it is not sufficient. The transformation is not complete enough to convince. If he wants to continue in this format he's going to have to be more aggressive about taking that form and wrestling it to the ground so that the image that finally emerges is one he's pinned down. As it is the form still dominates and traps his vision. It will be interesting to see how he deals with the dilemma in the future or if he abandons it altogether for another path. For those of you whose interest is piqued by these renderings of camp life. I would encourage you to seek out the works of art done by artists in the camps. Some amazing work emerged out of that experience, transcending the events themselves. Many of these artists are still painting and their vision remains clear and alive.

The class action race discrimination suit initiated by slain union reformer Gene Viernes and other young cannery workers will finally come to trial early next month over eight years after the suit was originally filed in federal district court.


The suit, charging Wards Cove Packing Company, Inc., Bumblebee Seafoods and Columbia Wards Fisheries with discriminating against their non-white employees, involves about 2,200 class members and five separate Alaska canneries.


The Asian and Pacific Islander plaintiffs are expected to argue that the three cannery companies maintained separate and inferior housing and food for minority workers and relegated them to lower paying, less desirable jobs.


Two similar lawsuits--against the New England Fish Company (NEFCO) and NEFCO-Fidalgo -- have already come to trial.


In the landmark NEFCO case Federal District Judge Gus Solomon ruled in November 1977 that NEFCO was guilty of discrimination against its non-white workers in the allocation of jobs, housing and promotions, However, only eight out of 124 claims for back pay have been granted.


In the NEFCO-Fidalgo case, which was decided last August, U.S. magistrate John L. Weinberg found evidence of discrimination in hiring for five out of eight higher paying cannery positions. Weinberg also ruled that NEFCO-Fidalgo discriminated in the assignment of housing, but said that the plaintiffs failed to establish discrimination in the provision of food.


Both cases are now on appeal.


All three suits were initiated in the early 1970's by the Alaska Cannery Workers Association, an organization created by young cannery workers to combat employment discrimination in the canneries. The suits, alleging violations of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, were the first class action lawsuits ever filed on behalf of a seasonal migratory labor force.


Gene Viernes dispatcher for the Seattle-based cannery union, Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU), was a key plaintiff in the suit which comes to trial early next month. In 1973 at Wards Cove, Viernes led a food strike, resulting in fruit and fresh vegetables for the Filipino crew. Through his actions, he brought together many of the minority cannery workers.


Viernes was instrumental in piecing together evidence in the case, noting in detail the discriminatory conditions in the canneries. Prior to his death, he had submitted affidavits for the suit, responding to questions and cross examination. The sister of Viernes, as executor of his estate, has been substituted for Gene in the cannery discrimination suit.


Viernes and Silme Domingo, the union's secretary-treasurer were shot to death at the union office June 1. in a murder conspiracy involving high stakes gambling in Alaska. Viernes and Domingo had attempted to reform the corrupt dispatch system.


Domingo was a plaintiff in the earlier NEFCO suit, along with his brother and eight other Filipino and Native American cannery workers.


In the upcoming court case, the plaintiffs are expected to provide statistical and documentary evidence and live testimony from the cannery witnesses.


Frank Atonio, one of the plaintiffs who worked at Wards Cove from 1972 to 1975, said he was unsuccessful in seeking promotion to one of the higher paying jobs at the cannery Atonio, who is Polynesian, said he was told that he needed more experience before he could qualify to become a machinist helper even though he spoke to a machinist helper who did not have previous experience to equip him for the job.


The suit against Wards Cove Packing Company Inc., Bumblebee Seafoods and Columbia Wards Fisheries will be heard by Federal Judge Justin L. Quackenbush a visiting judge from Spokane at the U.S. Courthouse in downtown Seattle. The trial starts May 3 and is expected to last about three to four weeks.

TOKYO -- A Japanese gynecologist is suing Time magazine over an article that quoted her as saying abortion is such a common practice in Japan ""it is like having a tooth out.""


Hideaki Kubori lawyer for Dr. Etsuko Negishi, told AP that Time admitted that reporters did not interview Negishi directly but used a partial quote from a Kyodo News Service story carried in an English-language newspaper. The quote was subsequently used in an article that appeared in a special issue on Japan.


Kubori said legal action involving a ""very large amount"" of money will be sought for defamation of character:


Negishi, who was a member of a committee studying sex and society, was quoted as saying that two out of three women in Japan undergo abortions.


Fellow researcher Chizuko lkegami, speaking on Negishi's behalf, said the reference did not mention that the figures was not representative of Japanese women in all age groups, and that her comment was taken out of context.


The original quote taken from Kyodo News Service said that ""for some people, having an abortion is like having a tooth out,"" noted news service managing director Ryuji Kitani. He said it was made in a joking manner, but even this, maintained lkegami, gives a ""totally wrong"" impression of what the gynecologist meant.


During the study, Negishi had been surprised that very few Japanese women mentioned abortion when asked about surgical experiences. She reasoned that some women do not think of abortions as surgery, just as some people do not consider tooth extractions as surgery either, her lawyer said.


Because Negishi's meaning was misinterpreted, she is also considering action against the Kyodo News Service, Kubori added.

""Flower Drum Song"" Muted


After all the furor over the San Francisco Musical Stage's revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater, the actual performance was anti-climactic.


Was it racist? Not very, Lex Amores as Dr. Li, the old country father of the picture-bride heroine, perhaps bobbed and tottered a bit much, but he was a pretty unobtrusive character.


The setting for ""Grant Avenue, San Francisco"" seemed remarkably subdued, even for 1932 with no glittering restaurants or shops--or weren't there any then? And I don't recall any cycle rickshaws in the '30s, nor, for that matter, as many folks in Chinese dress on the streets. But I could be wrong. It was a long time ago, to which the show had been backdated from its original '50s time setting.


Was it lively? A question to be answered yes and no. It had lovely songs, like ""A Hundred Million Miracles,"" chanted by the picture bride (Emily Kuroda) who gave a charmingly innocent portrayal of the naive young woman from the old country, but whose singing voice wasn't up to it; ""You Are Beautiful,"" done very effectively by hero David Lamm. And two very fine musical numbers: ""Don't Marry Me,"" sung with sparkle by C.D. Ka'ala Carmack as the flashy nightclub owner-gambler, Sammy Fong, and ""Gliding Through My Memoree,"" well rendered by Michael Ramirez, backed up by a tacky-looking ensemble of dancing girls in costumes of all nations: I loved this number. It reminded me of all the cheap night clubs I've ever been in, and such amusing theatrical experiences as ""Rum and Coca Cola"" and the Statue of Liberty finale in ""The Night They Raided Minsky's."" Deborah Shaw was good as the nightclub singer Linda Low. But both she and Carmack seemed to me to have more personal pizzaz than ever came through.


Partly this was due to the material, old-fashioned ""romantic"" stuff with the young suffering from being misunderstood by the older generation, complications and misunderstandings. The characters could just as well have been of any ethnic group with values of the old country and new in conflict; I had the feeling I'd seen it all before, but not in these costumes.


The dancers did very well (especially in the lyric. ""Helen's Dream,"" in which the three central women vie for the hero's love). They, and singers Lamm and Carmack, were the best things in the show. And I liked the wedding finale, with brilliant red costumes, charming little kids, and firecrackers going off.


But this has to be a mixed review. There were moments when ""Flower Drum Song"" dragged, and one had the feeling that the direction somehow served to tone down the competent Asian cast. Needed: more zing!

SAN JOSE -- The speculation over Wang Laboratories apparent bid to take over the Tymshare telecommunications company ended last week when Wang sold its shares in the company.


The world-renowned computer and office automation company, started by An Wang, had recently announced intentions to buy at least 25 percent of Tymshare's outstanding common stock, fueling speculation that a takeover was in the works.


But David Wu, partner and computer analyst at Montgomery Securities, told Cvnthia Kasabian of the S.F. Examiner that Wang was trying only to ""solidify potential business"" and had never meant to take over Tymshare.


Wang did turn a tidy profit on the affair, however.


Kasabian reported that Wang acquired 530,800 shares for about $18 per share, and sold them last week for about $26 a share, realizing a profit of about $4.2 million.


One market analyst familiar with the negotiations between Wang and Tymshare said relations between the two were less than warm from the beginning, and that Wang's offer on a takeover did not provide sufficient money.

NEW DELHI -- Folk doctors in the Himalayan mountain region of Ladakh use red-hot needles dipped in herbs to treat epilepsy, rheumatism, kidney and liver diseases, reports UPI.


Two-inch long needles made of gold are dipped while burning hot in herbs and then stabbed into epilepsy patients who prefer traditional Tibetan medical practices, noted Guermate Namgyal, one of the prominent folk doctors in the region.


Needles made of silver, copper iron or lead are used to treat other diseases in the arid mountains of Ladakh, 400 miles northeast of New Delhi.


There are about 225 folk doctors, known as Amchis, who practice traditional Tibetan medicine.


Namgyal is head of the Amchi Research Center, established by the Indian government in Leh, the largest city in Ladakh. He studied the system of medicine and said that many folk doctors claim that epilepsy can be cured by needles and herbs, which are collected from the glacial areas of the region.

By the time this edition hits the newsstand or the mailbox, I will have concluded three years of official ""retirement""--I have been advised to put retirement in quotes. By the same token I have completed three full years as an Asian Week columnist. I have given these matters much thought.


When I hung up my mailbag in the Post Office, and took my last ride in the official car, I had some mixed feeling. Was it the right thing to do? Right or wrong, I cannot go back now. Not only did I have behind the mailbag, but also the spacious mahogany wall panels and the large oak desk in the Federal Building at 7th and Mission streets. I just keep going on my ""appointed rounds."" Here I am with 36 months of freedom under my belt--what are my innermost thoughts? What can I share with my ex-co-workers, and how to counsel the contemplated retirees that inevitably must ""take the walk"" I took?


Retirement could be a bane or a blessing, depending on how you take it. You have all the time to make the kind of life you always dreamed of; yet you can get into people's way, they might hide from you when they see you coming. To a degree you are free to do what you wanted to do all your life; yet when I see the old men at Portsmouth Square or the old ladies at Washington Square, I wish I could enjoy their carefree conversations. They had a lifetime of experiences either in the . . . here; but day after day their conversations may get to be little monotonous. As time goes on I get to respect Self-Help for the Elderly and the On Lok Health Center more and more. We need more dedicated workers in those who senior citizens' centers.


I have been told that I must have some plan of action or planned activities when I leave my job. This is true. When you leave full-time employment, the hours go by so much faster, there seems never enough time to do things you wanted to do, and oftentimes you leave undone so much you wanted to do. It may be paradoxical: the more freedom you have, you will need more restraint on yourself. I got away from the regimentation when I left the Post Office, but without some guidelines for the day, week or month, the years will roll pretty fast. We need a plan for some action. It is better to make such a plan before you sign your retirement papers, or before you tell your boss off and ""chuck it all.""


Regardless where you serve in government--local, state or federal--if you work up to retirement, you must have learned some marketable skills. I think government and the large corporations have squeezed all the fat out of their rolls during the current recession. In a very short time I can see the dearth of technical skills in private industry and government. Ex-postal employees are now operating ""private postal stations"" in the neighborhoods and shopping centers. When I was still in the Postal Service there were ""mail delivery firms"" supplementing regular mail services. With a little imagination, some calculated risk and technical know-how, you can get started.


SCORE is operated by the Small Business Administration, and they are the senior corps of retired executives. Many managers and executives can find a haven there for their talents either as instructors or trainees. A statement attributed to Herbert Hoover said that the world makes way for the man who knows where he is going. Retirement is inevitable as birth, marriage or death. There comes a time we must give way to younger persons, so take it with good grace.


I need to say a word or two on financial restraint. Prior to the Postal Corporation in 1969, I learned financial responsibility. But since 1970 the key word is financial restraint. It did not take Reaganomics to make us live within our budget. Since the Postal Reorganization Act, the Postal Service must live within the budget; we were not there to make money, but certainly we cannot lose money or else we lose our jobs! It is no wonder that the Postal Service was able to stash away $500 million dollars in surplus while other Federal agencies wallow in red ink and deficit. That is both financial responsibility and restraint. There was a time when Postmasters and postal managers applying for positions in private industry got the brunt of the company jokes--but not anymore. Private industry now seeks them out as efficiency experts.


I want to conclude this column with a word about good health. Good mental health requires good physical health. The two go together. If you are able to get Social Security in addition to your government annuity, you can get Medicare after you are 65 years old. Private health insurance is almost prohibitive on limited income like a pension. As you grow older, your health insurance is a must! The best deal is Medicare plus your government health insurance. This will give you 100 percent coverage. It is so easy to say, ""I won't get sick. I am in top shape."" Five years ago I thought I was in perfect health--then came an open heart surgery and shortly after that, an automobile accident. The Postal Service continues to pay part of your health insurance after retirement. Don't drop it--once dropped, you cannot return to it.


If you are in good health, and if you are still ambitious to do some work, get some professional help to write your resume. The price is worth it because you may underestimate your own experience, or you may exaggerate to the point of not being realistic. Then start with SCORE or the SBA. Let your friends and associates know you are available for part-time work. You will be surprised at the response.

SAN FRANCISCO--Since the announcement of the ""Oyama Challenge"" on Nov. 12, Kimochi has received responses from almost 100 individuals, families and groups.


This fund-raising challenge to the community to help raise money urgently needed for construction completion of Kimochi Home was made by Mr. Clem Oyama, retired Nisei businessman, who will put up one dollar of his own money up to $100,000, for every two dollars donated between now and March 31, 1983.


Kimochi Home, the construction of which began in February of this year, is scheduled for completion in January, 1983. The new home will be a permanent facility providing services for residential care for the ambulatory elderly, respite care for short term emergency cases, adult day care, and senior center activities, and will cost an estimated $1.3 million.


""The maintaining of some physical facility in original Japantown means a lot to the community, especially to the elderly who have lost so much in the past 40 years,"" explained Sandy Ouye Mori, project coordinator of the Kimochi Home Project.


""In the Japanese American community, no direct service, non-profit organization has ever owned any land or property. What we are doing is of historical significance and a statement of what the community is trying to maintain,"" Ms. Mori continued.


Oyama indicated in his fundraising challenge that it is important that immediate action take place to secure as much money as possible in order to keep the bank loan to a minimum. ""We are not just building a building,"" Oyama said, Kimochi Home will also provide bilingual and bicultural services which would benefit present and future generations.


Tax-deductible donations may be sent to Kimochi Home Project, 1581 Webster St., #10, San Francisco, CA 94115.

SAN FRANCISCO - The Chinese community of the Richmond District showed not only unified support from within but also strong endorsement from outside the Chinese community to win approval of the embattled construction project for The Fook Restaurant last week before the Planning Commission.


Attorney and former S.F. Supervisor Gordon Lau, representing owner/developers Bill and Bob Young, brought support from such diverse elements as the Italian American president of a professional group in North Beach, the manager of a local branch of the Bank of America, the owner of a cabaret club in the affected neighborhood, a member of a local evangelical church and even the former president of the Clement Street Merchant Association, the group which opposed the construction of The Fook at 939 Clement St.


Instrumental in obtaining approval for the project from these groups and thus from the Planning Commission was the Young brothers' unsolicited offer to spend approximately $200,000 to add an underground, 20-space parking garage to the original plans for the restaurant.


Neighborhood interests had opposed the construction of the restaurant because the neighborhood is already rather saturated with food and beverage establishments, but had used the area's congestion and lack of parking facilities as the prime argument against approval of the project.


Some supporters of the project had grumbled that the merchant group's opposition was racially motivated, and indeed one Caucasian merchant in the area confided to Asian Week that he feared ""tong wars"" in the neighborhood if the influx of Chinese were not halted.


The offer to construct an off-street parking facility and to also work with the merchant group to find further long-range solutions of the parking problem took the wind out the sails of the neighborhood groups' opposition.


""The Young brothers are sensitive to the neighborhood concerns and want to work with the merchants and others in the Richmond,"" said Lau. ""That is why they have offered, at their own expense, to provide off-street parking to help alleviate the problem in the neighborhood.


""This has never been done before on Clement Street,"" Lau emphasized.


Architect Louis Sanchez display revised plans which showed that The Fook had been scaled down from a 220-seat to a 200-seat restaurant to allay fears that the establishment would draw more traffic than the area could handle.


Lau also presented statistics indicating the number of vehicles drawn to the restaurant, over what had been drawn to the laundry service formerly at the site, would be sufficiently serviced by the addition of the 20-space parking garage at The Fook.


Lau brought petitions and letters of support for the project from hundreds of residents as well as Stanely Chan, owner of the nearby Ocean Restaurant; Jack Anderson, owner of the Open Theatre Cafe; Al Giannini, owner of A&G Vacum Cleaners and for four years president of the Clement Street Merchants Association, and others.


Giannini's support was perhaps the biggest surprise of the public hearing. Giannini's letter, read by Lau, stated that the Young brothers' plan for a parking garage and their initiative in starting discussions with other area merchants satisfied him that the brothers would work with neighborhood inteerests to preserve the flavor of Clement Street and handle any problems that arise in the future.


Another dramatic moment came when Marco Vinella, chairman of an association of professionals in North Beach, appeared before the commission to praise the Young family for not only being interested in profit but also for working strongly with its community toward non-commercial goals. Vinella said he has worked with the Young family over North Beach/Chinatown concerns many times over the years.


Some of the others speaking in support of the project included residents Sandy Wong and Mary Chan, and realtor Martin Eng, a member of the San Francisco Bible Church in the neighborhood.


Eng said the members of his church needed to have a quality restaurant in the area of The Fook's site because it was within walking distance of the church. Without it, he said, members would be forced to drive their cars deeper into the Clement neighborhood to find restaurants after services and meetings, adding to the parking problems of the neighborhood.


Also, Eng warned that if the Planning Commission allowed the Merchants Association to ""change the rules in the middle of the game,"" then other investors seeking to build in San Francisco would be wary of bringing their business to The City.


""If this project is not passed, I will advise my clients to stay away from San Francisco,"" Eng warned.


""Ghetto-creating situation""


An attempt was made by the merchant's group to bring labor union considerations into the debate, charging that Chinese restaurants for the most part are non-union and underpay their employees.


Charles Lamb, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union Local 2, came to the hearing at the request of the merchants. He was unable to address the commission because of the length of the meeting, but told Asian Week of his concerns.


""Building restaurants to create work for new immigrants (one argument in support of the project) is no answer,"" Lamb said. ""Having immigrants depend on unskilled jobs such as restaurant work is a ghetto-creating situation, especially if the restaurants are non-union and underpay the immigrants.


""These people cannot afford transportation costs, so they have to live close to their place of employment. And they can't affort high rents, so they end up sleeping five or six people per room to make ends meet,"" Lamb said.


""Why can't we put immigrants to work helping to rebuild the infrastructure of our society?"" Lamb asked. ""We should have a public works program like Roosevelt's. The roads, for instance, are in terrible shape. Let's employ some of the immigrants on rebuilding roads, parks and other public facilities, pay them a decent wage so they don't have to live in situations that can breed overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and perhaps even violence.""


Commissioners Jerry Klein and Sue Bierman made a half-hearted attempt to raise the labor issue during the hearing, but Commission President Rosenblatt admonished the two to stick to ""the issues brought before us by the neighborhood groups.""


Young, however, told the commission that though many of his employees earn the minimum wage, they are covered by health insurance and receive a one-week vacation each year.


Lau also cautioned commission members not to stereotype such establishments as The Fook. ""Not all employees of Chinese restaurants are underpaid,"" he said.


Finally, when it became apparent that the merchants' arguments regarding parking spaces carried little weight, residents living in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant site raised more practical concerns of the restaurant's structure blocking light from their windows, the ventilation fans creating noise, and their plea that the restaurant's hours of operation be kept within reason to cut down on late-night noise.


Lau agreed to work with the neighbors on details regarding these concerns, and the commission gave approval for the project on condition that the details be properly worked out.

STOCKTON, CA -- On March 28, Chol Soo Lee, a 30-year-old Korean immigrant whose case has become a rallying point for Asian American activists throughout the country, walked out of San Joaquin County Jail, his first taste of freedom in almost 10 years.


Last September, Lee was acquitted in a retrial of a 1973 San Francisco Chinatown murder charge. And in January of this year, a State Appellate Court overturned Lee's conviction in the 1977 killing of Morrison Needham, a neo-Nazi gang member, a killing which took place while Lee was in prison. The California Supreme Court last month upheld the Appellate Court's decision, setting the stage for Lee's release on bail.


Lee was welcomed by his mother and over 30 cheering supporters as he walked out of jail. His release was made possible when, just hours earlier, several Asians put up property as bail.


The week prior to Lee's release, bail had been set at $250,000. Under California law, if property is used for bail instead of cash, twice the set amount must be put up. But, at a bail hearing, defense attorney Stuart Hanlon argued successfully for a lower, ""more reasonable"" bail. Superior Court Judge K. Peter Saiers lowered the amount to $118,000, so that the appraised value of three houses put up as bond, totalling $236,232, was enough to enable Lee to be freed.


Lee's conviction in the killing of Needham was predicated on a prosecution contention that Lee was a hitman for Nuestra Familia, a Chicano prison gang. The prosecution argued that Lee was ordered to kill Needham, but Lee has maintained that he acted in self-defense.


In a recent trial of several Nuestra Familia members, the jury ruled that Lee's alleged co-conspirators had nothing to do with the death of Needham, in effect damaging the prosecution's case against Lee, Judge Saiersset July 11 as the date for Lee's retrial.


Jay Yoo, national coordinator of the Committee to Free Chol Soo Lee, said a retrial would be ""futile, a waste of community and taxpayers' dollars."" Because of the appellate court's decision, Hanlon said, most of the evidence in the 1979 trial can not be used. He estimated the cost of a retrial at over one million dollars.


Later, at an impromptu celebration and press conference, Lee thanked the Asian American communities for their support. He said he would like to work to bridge the differences between the various Asian American communities.


Although Lee expressed hope that the District Attorney would choose not to retry him, he is confident that he could show that he acted in self-defense if he is retried.


Since his release, Lee has met with supporters, ""thanking the people who have helped me out, so they can see me as a person like themselves.""


""I appreciate every bit of freedom that I see,"" Lee said.


Since his release. Lee has been living with his mother, Me Yea Lee in San Jose. He said he hopes to work in the near future, but that preparation for the retrial will take up a lot of his time. ""Until the prosecution comes to an end. I can't settle down and live a normal life,"" he said.


The San Francisco, Bay Area Committee to Free Chol Soo Lee recently started a campaign to get the San Joaquin County District Attorney to dismiss the case. The Committee is urging Lee's supporters to send letters to: San Joaquin County District Attorney, 222 E. Weber St. Stockton, CA 95202.

CORTE MADERA--The mansuspected of being responsible for the ""White Power Headquarters"" telephone hotline was ordered by his father to cease his association with neo-Nazi activities.


Tom Niederreuther, 22, has had an obsession about Adolf Hitler since his youth, said his father, Dr. Erich Niederreuther. According to Phil Bronstein of the San Francisco Examiner the son has filled his room with Nazi posters and considers Hitler a hero.


The recorded messages on the ""hotline"" had enraged the Asian community. (See Asian Week, 6/16/83.) One message had congratulated James Pierman for allegedly killing Thong Hy Huynh recently in Davis. Another message had claimed non-whites commit 80 percent of the crimes in California, and urged action to halt the flow of non-whites into the state.


The younger Niederreuther switched his story when interviewed by Bronstein on two occasions regarding the hotline first claiming he did not know the ""H. Schmitz"" whose name appeared on WPH flyers but later saying the man had rented a room in the family's house but had now moved.


Law enforcement officials had told Asian Week the person responsible for the racist ""hotline"" was not known to have any violent tendencies nor any ""violent-type contacts that we know of.""


""I will disinherit him (my son)"" if he doesn't discontinue his racist activities, warned Dr. Niederreuther, who said he might send his son to stay with relatives in Germany. ""They'll heal him. They laugh at (Hitler worship) over there.""

TOKYO -- Just as Japanese influence has creeped into Western society through film, art, fashion, food and technology, so has the West influenced the Japanese lifestyle, even in the home.


Twenty years ago, notes John Woodruff of the Baltimore Sun, the Japanese family relaxed on a tatami mat in a large room which had only two or three pieces of traditional furniture.


Several years ago the Japanese family was more likely to gather ""in a carpeted living room on Scandinavian-style furniture.""


But today, the pull of the two cultures leave home designers with an uncertain view about what present homes should look like.


Said Jiro Yano, vice president of one of Japan's largest home-building firms, ""We went from extreme to extreme in the past 15 years. What we are going to have to do now is find ways to compound the two cultures so Japanese people can live with modern comforts while retaining elements of their own culture.""


He pointed out that besides carpeting and furniture, the past 15 years have brought changes in the form of the addition of garages or carports, electrical outlets to accomodate a burgeoning list of appliances, and separate bedrooms with Western-style beds. It is quite different from sleeping ""under heavy futon quilts on tatami mats in the all-purpose common room.""


Some Japanese view the changes as progress, but most feel that the change is coming about too quickly, and want to ""make more effort to keep part of their heritage in their living places.""


""We are in a period of trial and error, a period of transition,"" Yano reiterates. ""It is a period . . . and testing, and we are still seeking answers on how to combine the two cultures.""


He believes that ever since the end of World War II, the Japanese have rushed to adopt Western ways, without pausing to think about what they're leaving behind in the process.


To assist with the transition, Yano's firm, Shokusan Jutaku Sogo Co. Ltd., uses a range of modern methods while looking for ways to help homeowners preserve tradition.


The firm occasionally hires American-style marketing surveys to determine the needs of buyers, and has a panel of about 20 homemakers who serve as advisors to architects.


""More than 1,000 years ago, our people imported massive new cultural elements from China and Korea,"" Yano said. ""We had to find ways to bring harmoney out of those changes, and now since the great shock of World War II we have to do it again.""


In an ""earlier wave of cultural borrowing,"" the Japanese were influenced by elements that have remained dominant in their culture to this day, including Buddhism, the Chinese writing system and the art and architectural methods of old China. This cultural borrowing often has an impact on the lives of the people that they are not quite prepared for.


Some Japanese are uncertain about the impact of separate bedrooms will have on the dynamics of Japanese family life.


""When everyone slept in the same bedroom, there was a certain necessity about getting along together and maintaining civility,"" said Tazuko Shibusawa, a Japanese social counselor who was educated at UCLA.


""If the son and the daughter and the parents each have separate rooms, it makes privacy possible, but it also creates an irresistible temptation to resort to Western-style isolation and shutting out when there is friction.""

BRISBANE--The night life of this village, nestled in the hills south of San Francisco, has just taken a quantum leap into the '80s!


The Pumpkin Seed Restaurant, popular among locals for the diversity and affordable prices on its lunch menu, celebrated its opening for dinner and live entertainment with a party on Friday, Jan. 28.


With the addition of a new dance floor and small stage for a band, the restaurant has had to move its salad bar and lecture employees on navigating around the dancers, but the adjustment has been made with ease thanks to the spacious design of the dining room.


Pumpkin Seed proprietor Tony Santa Elena, Jr., a native of the Philippines, personally greeted many of the guests at the grand opening party, among whom was Brisbane Mayor William Lawrence and his wife.


Santa Elena was one of the first chefs for the Good Earth Restaurant chain, which specializes in natural foods. He helped organize Good Earth's kitchens in most of its Bay Area locations, and refined the Good Earth menu during his 14 years with the chain. He is also the author of the acclaimed cook book, Good Food.


His menu at the Pumpkin Seed boasts more variety than that of a health food restaurant, however. ""I started the Pumpkin Seed because I wanted to expand, to serve more kinds of food,"" he said. ""I think this restaurant's uniqueness, which has certainly caught on well with the lunch crowd, will be a great success during the dinner hours too.""


Variety extends beyond the menu to entertainment as well. Santa Elena did not want to limit the restaurant's appeal to the fans of any particular style of music, so the fare on the dance floor includes Big Band, jazz, Filipino folk and modern music, soft rock and more.


On opening night the music was complemented with professional dancers on the floor, who especially gave the crowd an eyeful during their almost athletic demonstrations of the Jitterbug.


Hidden in the hills of Brisbane at the corner of Old Bayshore and Old Country Road, the Pumpkin Seed offers an evening of good food and entertainment in an atmosphere untainted with the hustle and bustle of The City, though it is only a 10-minute drive away.

SAN FRANCISCO -- According to statistics released by Chinatown Resources Development Center, its job placement rate was 98 percent for the past year. The agency noted that 215 of the 220 students that had graduated from the center's program had been hired during the 1982-1983 fiscal year.


CRDC provides job skill and language training for individuals with limited English and little or no local work experience, with a direct-hire job as the ultimate goal. This is done through classroom and on the job training in conjunction with many of the Bay Area's larger corporations such as McKesson, Wells Fargo and NCR. Upon completion of the program many of the students are employed in entry level positions with the companies that they trained with. Major contributions have also been made by IBM, which has donated a System-34 and 8 terminals for the center's computer program in addition to providing a full time technical consultant.

SAN FRANCISCO -- In the world of contemporary Japanese art, the relationship between Japan and the West has resulted in the development of an outlook that is more international than strictly traditional Japanese.


This was the summary of opinions voiced at an Artists, Forum held at the St. Francis Hotel on Sept. 14. Sponsored by the Japan Society, the panel of speakers included renowned film director Nagisa Oshima, fashion designer Issey Miyake, Kazuko Koike, associate curator of the Seibu Museum and curator of the Seibu Department Store Gallery, Tomihiro Kumagai, Audie Bock, Japanese cinema expert, and Henry T. Hopkins, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.


The 1,000-strong crowd gathered in the Grand Ballroom were treated to a lively and insightful evening of various aspects of Japanese art. At the beginning of the program was a presentation of 1982 award-winning Japanese TV commercials, which proved to be a far cry from the regular American fare doled out to TV viewers.


The advertisements, which promoted food products, Toshiba and Hitachi . . . were creative, visually enticing and highly effective in capturing the attention of the viewer. Imagine cabbage-like rolls dancing in a frying pan or a mini sized man nonchalantly walking across a pool table while totally engrossed in his newspaper and managing to avoid the balls, and you get the picture.


Tomihiro Kumagai, formerly an executive producer at NHK, the Japan National Broadcast Company, presented his view on East meets West through a short film presentation. It is apparent that much of Japan's city life and culture is an imitation of the American lifestyle, but a difference still exists, in the spirituality of the Japanese people, he said in the film.


The external characteristics of Japanese life may be Americanized, maihtained Kumagai, as in buildings, clothes, food and music, but the internal values remain traditionally Japanese. He pointed out that this is reflected in the traditional wedding ceremony, which has not lost its appeal with younger Japanese. Traditional culture is something which is deeply rooted in the Japanese, despite the Americanization of Japan he added.


A graduate of Waseda University, Kazuko Koike has directed a number of exhibitions on the development of fashion, and has contributed extensively to the cross-cultural development of interior design.


""Japan imitates, absorbs, and then changes (what it has learned) into a new Japanese culture,"" Koike said.


""The '60s was the first era that Japan shared contemporary feelings with other countries, the counter culture of the West... the Beatles, Beach Boys, miniskirts and the hippies were all popular in Japan,"" she said.


""It was in the late '60s that Japanese citizens began to travel abroad because of the stronger economic situation. The counterplay of culture was enjoyed by many for the first time in history, and the amount of information to and from the West can be compared to a strong waterfall or a splash of water.""


In the same vein, Japanese cinema was greatly influenced by the West, noted Audie Bock, who wrote ""Japanese Film Directors"" and worked as the assistant producer for the international version of Akira Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha.""


""The '20s and '60s were the periods when the Japanese questioned their past values... there was a sense of avantgardism,"" Bock said. ""Nagisa Oshima was one of those filmmakers who set out to question the old values. He is a controversial social critic who deals with issues around him, going out into the streets and observing the daily problems that people face. His films have depicted class distinctions and social deviance.


""Right now I'm involved in an anti-cockroach commerical,"" grinned Nagisa Oshima, as Bock interpreted. His opening line immediately sent out a burst of laughter through the room.


Best known to American film viewers for his controversial and commercially successful films about love and death. ""In the Realm of Senses"" (1976) and ""The Empire of Passion"" (1978). Oshima was awarded the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1978.


On a more serious note, . . . said that he was proud of the ""energy and dedication with which the Japanese film industry has tried to perform a service for the people.""


""A lot of times people ask Japanese film directors, 'Why did you use Western music?' or 'Were you inspired by Shake speare in doing this film?' and I tell them that music is music, most Japanese grow up listening to Western music...and yes. I have read Shakespeare, but it is not because of him that I have made such and such a film.


""People seem to think that it is a day, a moment . . . we receive influence from the West...that there is a pure Japanese person who reads Western literature and in a flash, receives influence from the West.""


He pointed out that when he read fairy tales in Japan, he not only read Japanese fairy tales but was also exposed to the brothers Grimm. Hans Christian Andersen and Aesop's fables.


""I also read Sherlock Holmes before reading any detective stories by Japanese authors,"" Oshima quipped.


""Before a Japanese can achieve consciousness of himself, he must receive some influence from the West. It is only when as artists we seek ourselves that we find what we have to express.""


He pointed out that many Japanese artists snare this progressive experience and gradually become more and more ""Japanized"" in their work.""


The reason the Japanese have been attracted to Western culture, Oshima suggested, is because ""the Japanese felt that they lost to the West.""


""They suffered defeat two times, once during the Meiji Restoration when Japan opened its doors to the West for trade, and during World War II...that's why the Japanese are so avid about learning all they can about Western culture.""


However, this movement appears to have reached a peak. Oshima believed. ""There doesn't seem to be any more that Japan can learn...I think now a certain kind of equality has been reached, and opens up a new world of opportunities for both cultures to share.""


Issey Miyake


""As a student I was always fascinated by the intrinsic flow and dynamic shape of Western clothes, and also the traditional Japanese fabric like cotton and denim,"" said Issey Miyake considered one of the top clothing designers in the world.


Graduating from the Tama Art University in 1960, Miyake went to Paris and served as apprentice to Guy Laroche and Givenchy in Paris and later Geoffrey Beene in New York. He returned to Tokyo in 1970, opened the Miyake Design studio and announced the 'Issey Miyake' line of clothes.


While in Parie he found that unlike Western designers, he had no ""heritage of Western clothing,"" and began to wonder about his role as a Japanese designer. He decided to view the lack of Western heritage as an advantage, and ""try anything new.""


""There is no past in me as far as Western clothing heritage is concerned,"" he said.


Miyake's clothes convey a sense of freedom and the material falls loosely on the body, which is his intention. ""My clothes should not be confined to the body,"" he explained. ""They should make one feel free. They reflect the new era when both men and women are free and conventions are loose. Clothes are an expression of the body and mind.""


Like Oshima, he noted that Western culture had long influenced the Japanese. ""We are, brought up with Disney's pictures and almost never wear kimonos!"" he laughted.


But a difference lies in the view of art, where ""in the Japanese tradition, there is no separation between art and craft.""


""The concept of 'art for art's sake' is a foreign idea in Japan,"" Miyake added, ""so I'm not an artist in this sense.""


""I have had the good fortune of being exposed to both Western and Japanese culture, but I try to be strong enough so I am not influenced by either. I aim for a universal design to try to appeal to both Japanese and Western people,"" he said.

BEPORE SHE BECAME Executive Director of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), Laura Chin thought she would find it difficult to leave her job in the federal government after 12 years of service there, ""but I felt compelled to change my work, given the political climate in this city,"" Chin said in a phone interview from the OCA national office in Washington, D.C.


Chin, who was born in China and grew up in New York City, moved to Washington to do graduate work at . . . University in 1968. From there she went to work for the government as an editor and writer for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and was public affairs officer for the Special Counsel's Office in the U.S. Merit System Protection Board before she took the position of OCA Executive Director in February, 1982.


Chin had been chairperson and an active member of the Asian and Pacific American Federal Employees Council for several years. Although she had not been an active member of OCA when she accepted the post of Executive Director, she had worked closely with the organization on many issues over the years.


OCA, because it is the only national Chinese American group with an office in the Washington D.C. area, is involved in many national Asian American issues, and particularly tries to monitor national legislation. OCA also serves as a clearing-house of information about Chinese Americans for the Washington D.C. area.


OCA has been instrumental in getting the presidential proclamation of Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week each year, and would like to get a clause added to the original bill passed by Congress in 1978 to make the week recognizing the contributions of Asian and Pacific Americans an automatic annual event.


When the Small Business Administration considered deleting Asian and Pacific Americans from its definition of minority groups, OCA worked to oppose that decision.


After receiving a grant from the Department of Education, OCA developed A Place Called Chinese America, a book for secondary school students explaining the history and accomplishments of Chinese Americans.


In 1980, the organization formed its Business Advisory Council, which this year is planning to publish a national Chinese American Business Directory.


OCA was also active in the fight to overturn the Bakke reverse discrimination decision, and bilingual education has been one of the organization's major concerns.


One major focus of OCA's lobbying efforts last year was a bill to revise U.S. immigration regulations. The bill died when Congress adjourned in December, but it will be resubmitted for further debate this year. ""We want to insure United States immigration laws are as fair as possible,"" Chin said.


OCA lobbied heavily for an amendment, contained in the immigration bill, to do away with discriminatory colonial quotas, limiting the number of immigrants from colonies such as Hong Kong, where there are six to 12 year waiting lists depending on the preference category of the immigrant.


OCA opposed the employer sanctions contained in the immigration bill, requiring employers to have all prospective employees show identification to prove citizenship or alien registration before hiring. ""Anyone foreign looking will be subject to scrutiny,"" Chin pointed out, and Asians ""will be the ones asked first,"" she said.


The Organization of Chinese Americans is a non-profit, non-partisan group involved in social and business issues ""for Chinese Americans living in this country"" for the past 10 years, according to Chin. The organization has 26 chapters in 20 states, mainly in the eastern section of the country, but with three chapters in California. ""We'd like to do more in Oregon and Washington,"" Chin explained, but there are no OCA Chapters so far in the Northwest.


""We try to provide a national network of support,"" according to Chin. ""My own point of view as an Asian in America is that it is important that we organize and encourage Chinese to participate as equal partners in American society. We have to make people aware they can make a difference.""


Since Chin joined the very small staff of OCA as its first woman director, the group has concentrated on organizing new chapters. ""I've been surprised by the number of Chinese I have met who are really concerned about the need for Chinese Americans to organize,"" Chin said.

TOKYO - The Tokyo-based Kinokuniya Co., a major book dealer and publisher, has issued an apology for apparent discriminatory labor policies in the employment of women.


According to a report in Hokubei Mainichi, Kinokuniya had recently circulated a confidential intra-company memo stating that all ""ill-looking (busu), small (chibi)"" or bespectacled women should not be hired, Women who look like ""bumpkins (kappe)"" should be banned as well, the memo said.


In response to the massive uproar over the report of its hiring practices, the company, which has about 20 stores in its chain, wrote letters of apology to the labor union and feminist organizations. They admitted that their policies could have led to the violations of human rights.


However, the union noted that the company still insisted that they had not ""followed any discriminatory policy toward women.""

LOS ANGELES--Asian American actors continue to find few roles open to them in American theatre and motion pictures, and the image of Asian Americans projected in American films and plays is seldom good.


""The portrayal of Asians in the American media directly parallels the international relations between the U.S. and the countries of Asia,"" said world-famous Chinese American actress Beulah Quo. ""If relations--say, with China or Japan--show a strong improvement, we'll see a number of plays and movies with more Asian actors and a more positive portrayal of Asian Americans.


""But I don't see any trend coming for more roles opening up for Asian actors in this country,"" she added.


Jack Ong, a well known actor, director and writer, agreed with Quo's conjecture.


""Unfortunately, statistically speaking there are not more roles opening up for Asian actors. In fact, it's going backward,"" Ong said. ""I find myself working more and doing less.""


""Asians can play any role, but Hollywood doesn't think so,"" added Quo. ""Producers want to play it safe. In the producer's mind middle America does not want to see Asians in regular programming. The producers don't want to expand without knowing the consequences in advance, and they don't know whether audiences would accept Asian actors in regular, middle American roles.


""I think they've progressed past the point of seeing us in only stereotypical roles, but they still can't see Asians in starring roles because Asians are not bankable in this country,"" Quo said.


""A minority's prominence in the entertainment business is decided by its proportion in the general population,"" she said. Noting that Asians are projected to overtake blacks as the second-largest minority in California by 1990, she said, ""I think that should affect the portrayal of Asian Americans, at least in Californian programming.


""But the demand for more roles and a better image must come from our community. The Asian American community must apply pressure on Hollywood and make its feelings known. If there is no pressure, then Hollywood won't do anything about it,"" Quo charged.


""When I talk to other writers, I emphasize to them that Asian Americans are part of American society, and that they should try to write more Asian Americans into their scripts,"" said Ong. ""But we are still usually typecast into specifically Asian roles instead of just another part of the mainstream.


""I'd be satisfied if we were portrayed as we really are--good, bad and in between, just like everyone else. When I look at most theatrical productions being done these days, I don't see any regular role that couldn't be played by an Asian American actor,"" Ong said.


Quo said the portrayal of Asians has historically followed America's relations with Asia.


""First there was the Yellow Peril syndrome early this century. The, when relations with Asia improved somewhat, we had Charlie Chan, the all-wise Chinese detective, even though he was always portrayed by a Caucasian, followed by a smart-alec Chinese son who always bungled things.


""Then in the 1940s, after the war had begun, there was a rash of anti-Japanese movies,"" Quo said. ""And after the communists gained power in China, all Asians in American movies were portrayed as heavies. In the early '60s, after Hawaii had gained statehood, there was a rash of movies with a more positive Asian or Pacific theme.""


Both Quo and Ong felt that it was Hollywood's lack of experience with and exposure to Asian Americans that was responsible for the lack of acting jobs for Asians and the poor images in roles that are available.


""Hollywood misidentifies Asian Americans,"" Quo commented. ""Now, many of these kids are fourth fifth or sixth generation Americans, as American as apple pie. But Hollywood doesn't think of them as Asian American, it thinks of them as Asian Asian, that they should speak with an accent in all the roles they play.""


""We're making progress, a few steps at a time,"" said Ong. ""I recently got to see Jim Lau and Mariko Tse do a scene that I originally wrote years ago for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, and it was really great to see Asian American actors in roles not specifically written for Asians. We'll eventually get more and better roles. It just takes time, like everything else.""


""I feel that as more Asian American writers enter the business and write the scripts that will be produced on the stage or screen, and as more Asian American actors enter the pool of talent available to the casting directors, they will demand and get better roles for Asians,"" said Quo.

SACRAMENTO -- The Sacramento Asian/Pacific Women's Network drew over 200 participants to its Leadership, Key to Excellence dinner recently.


""The theme was chosen not only to honor Asian leaders in education but to emphasize and perpetuate the quality of excellence that Asian/Pacific Americans have achieved through education. We don't have the numbers but we do exert some influence intellectually because of our high level of education, which equates to an inherent equal level of competence, said Lily Keyser, chair person for the event.


The evening featured speeches by Agnes Chan and John Tsu, a graphic presentation by network members of the under-utilization of Asians in policy-making positions in education, and a spontaneous response by Pete Mesa, Chief Deputy of the Department of Education on the concerns delivered by the speakers.


Agnes Chan, member of the California State Board of Education, and Dr. John Tsu; Commissioner to the Education Commission of the States, were honored by the network for their recent appointments to their respective posts by Governor Deukmejian.


Also in attendance were members of the California Board of Education, Sacramento City Board of Education, San Juan School District Trustees executive staff of the California Department of Education and executive staff of the Sacramento Unified School District.


""Asian men got where they are because there were Asian women . . . them,"" said Chan in her speech. ""But Asian women are beginning to make their own presence known. They are moving to the top, becoming a more visible force, no longer content to stay in the background as in the past.""


Chan also told the audience to ""encourage more Asian students to get into teaching as a career in order to maintain the Asian role in quality education.""


""The Asian role in the U.S. will be accelerated in the very near future"" asserted John Tsu. ""President Reagan made that very clear when he called the next century, the century of the Pacific.""


""The Asian Pacific region which was important in terms of culture will be very important to the United States in terms of trade, industrial development and military strategy. Education will play a major role in preparing the United States for this major change,"" Tsu said.


""To get ready for this change, we must form a coalition with other under-utilized groups and assert ourselves,"" said Tsu. ""Only then will we be able to exert the influence necessary to secure our share of the leadership roles now denied us.""


Pete Mesa, chief deputy of the Department of Education, called for ""a change in the present use of the 'corporate image' used by decision makers to select executives.""


Nobody, he said, questions the competence of Asian/Pacific Americans.


""But competence is not always the criterion given the highest priority when choosing leaders or executives. We need to work together to make competence a high selection criterion."" Mesa said.


Co-hosts for the event included the California Asian/Pacific Women's Network. Asian State Employees Association, Stepping Stones, Filipino American State Employees Association, Asian Staff Legislative Caucus Sacramento City Schools Asian Educators. Asian Pacific American Advocates of California, McCellan Air Force Base Asian Employees and California Chinese American Republican Association.

TOKYO -- It seems that in all big cities of the world where concrete towers run rampant, the first thing that is missed is the sun. In San Francisco residents are afraid that a high-rise development will block out the sun's rays from a children's playground. It was the same story in New York, and a similar problem exists even in the Land of the Rising Sun.


Over the past decade Japanese cities have juggled with all kinds of ordinances to guarantee residents a minimum daily requirement of sunshine in their houses and apartments. With skyscrapers being the status quo nowadays, urban dwellers are more adamant about their right to light and heat -- it is not a right to be taken away by developers, writes Clyde Haberman in the New York Times.


This means that anyone in Tokyo who puts up a building that takes away his neighbor's share of sunshine can expect to pay as much as $420 to $1260 for each hour of lost sunlight. In special cases the going rate has been as high as $12,000.


So the government has stepped in and is working on a plan to raise the height limit, which currently stands at 33 feet, on buildings in many residential districts in the city. The plan also calls for less stringent requirements for sunshine, giving developers the boost that they have been looking for.


While the government is engaged in heavy shadow play on the issue contractors and local residents often turn local courts to decide on a fair compensation. A district court judge in Tokyo ruled that the Tokyo metropolitan government was taking too long to reach a decision, costing developers valuable time and money. So the judge ordered the city to pay one construction company $50,000 for letting a sunshine dispute drag on for months.


The topic of sunshine payments has become such a common issue that many contractors see it as part of the cost of doing business.


In central Tokyo's Minato ward there was the case of the owner of a three-story apartment house who calculated that he and his tenants would lose about five hours of sunlight a day because of a 10-story building that was to be constructed across the street. The developer doesn't argue that some sort of compensation is necessary, the question is how much.


""Even scholars can't give us a clear answer as to why the Japanese value sunshine so much,"" said Kazuo Tanabe, who is in charge of sunshine issues for the Tokyo government. But I think traditionally we have always found it especially important in winter. I don't think Westerners depend on sunshine as much as we do.""


The local authorities have found it necessary to work out complex codes that explain in detail how much of a shadow is cast by a new building on its neighbors. The most stringent codes state that during the winter solstice a building can not cast a shadow ""for more than three hours a day up to a point 16 feet from the property line or more than two hours up to 33 feet."" Frustrated architects have often had to change their designs.


In several instances parents have sued builders for putting their children's playground in the shade. The Japanese National Railways paid $1.2 million several years ago to the people of Ichikawa, a town east of Tokyo, for an elevated line that left them in the dark. Other city inhabitants have collected because they couldn't put their futons out to dry or because of radio interference.

TOKYO -- Nippon Telegraph & Telephone opened its fourth major laboratory at the same time it made a technological breakthrough that could lead to ""super computers"" with hundreds of times the capability of present computers within a few decades.


At its new $100 million lab in the Tokyo suburb of Atsugi, NTT announced it had developed a new 1,000-bit memory chip with 10,000 Josephson Junctions on it, according the Los Angeles Times.


""We created a device that had about twice the speed of semi-conductors but consumed only one five-hundredth of the electricity a semi-conductor consumes,"" said researcher Akira Ishida.


This brings Japan closer to the development of ""fifth-generation"" computers, which NTT expects might help to completely change human lifestyle by the year 2000, automating homes, offices, communications, etc.


""The integrated network system will be the infrastructure of society,"" Makoto Watanabe, director of the Atsugi lab, told the Times.


Development of the system will take an investment of about $83 billion, and it would take until at least 1980 to put together a total system. But the development of fifth-generation computers is seen as the stuff of science fiction -- giving human like intelligence to machines -- and the industrialized nations of the world are racing to be the first to accomplish the feat.

The 1983 Asian American Artists Exhibition is currently on display at the Wing Luke Museum through July 31.


Although the show is entitled ""One Sense of Beauty,"" the exhibit, containing 43 pieces from 35 Asian American artists in Washington, demonstrates the diversity of Asian art today. Both traditional and contemporary art are represented in many different media including jewelry and pottery.


The Museum presents this annual June-July event, originally sponsored by the Seattle Arts Commission in the 1970's. This year, art works were submitted in mid-May and selected on a juried basis by board members of the Museum.


The art works were judged on the basis of technique, presentation, and originality. Stephen Tse received the ""Best of Show"" for his oil painting ""P-P-82-122."" Four artists received ""Jury Awards"": Gary A. Hostallero for ""Samurai,"" a work done in ball point pen and gold leaf; Marion Fukuma for ""Spring Dawn"" a print; Izumi Kuroiwa for ""Descending Water, Rain,"" a work in woodcut and textiles; and Shui-Cho Chung for ""Flower,"" a photograph.


This colorful, multi-media exhibition is an excellent showcase for Asian artists; several in this show are having their first professional viewing.


Most of the art is for sale. Kit Freudenberg, director of the Museum, says the artists receive all of the fees, the Museum takes no commission.


Demonstrations by the artists at the Museum have also been arranged. On June 18, Daniel Wang explained his watercolor technique to an enthusiastic audience. His presentation was signed for the deaf, a practice the Museum would like to encourage.


The Museum will have demonstrations given by many artists on July 31, as part of the International District Summer Street Fair: Techniques in calligraphy, wood carving, printing, and traditional Chinese and Japanese watercolor will be presented with public participation encouraged.


Thirteen artists selected from this exhibition will have their work included in a traveling show sponsored by Exhibit Touring Services which begins January, 1984 in Yakima.


The Wing Luke Museum will next host an exhibit of Tibetan Art, entitled ""Roof of the World"" commencing August 1.


Plans are also being made to bring in a Chinese theatre exhibit from San Francisco. The Museum is seeking information on the history of Chinese opera in Seattle. Those who have information should contact Kit Freudenberg at the Museum.


The Museum will also have a used book sale during the International District Fair as part of a fundraising drive. All donations are welcome.

HONOLULU--The people with the surname Lum are proud of the accomplishments of two distinguished members in Hawaii, Chief Justice Herman T.F. Lum and Adjutant General of the State of Hawaii, Alexis T. Lum.


The story of the Chief Justice's rise to eminence and power is still the talk of the town and there are plans to honor him with a testimonial dinner by the local Chinese community.


Brig. General Lum became the new adjutant general for Hawaii on March 31. He was a former commander of the Hawaii Army National Guard and named to the highest state military post by Governor George R. Ariyoshi to replace retiring Maj. General Arthur U. Ishimoto. As adjutant general, Lum has the overall command of the Hawaii Army, Air and State Guards and the State Civil Defense.


A second star was pinned upon him recently to promote him to Major General, one of the highest ranking generals of Chinese ancestry in Hawaii.

The Mien are a minority in Laos as well as minority immigrants to the United States. There is little published literature about the Mien in Laos and little about them in their resettlement in the U.S. The best text that I can find up to the present time is ""Becoming Americans (Asian Sojourners, Immigrants and Refugees in Western United States)"" by Tricia Knoll. (See review of Ms. Knoll's book by this writer in Asian Week, 11/18/82 and 11/25/82.) Again quoting Knoll:


""In Laos the Mien became a minority among minorities, a status they had faced in China. Numbering over 3 million in China, fewer than 50,000 lived in Laos. One of dozens of ethnic minorities in Laos, they moved into the mountains between the attitudes of 3,000 and 4,000 feet. Mien lived just below the Hmong, but they spoke a different language and virtually never intermarried. In small villages ranging from a low of ten to a high of a hundred families, but averaging around fifteen, they clustered into strong clan and family groups. (page 224)


""In America the Mien are once again a minority among minorities. Estimates place 3,000 to 4,000 in the United States: 1500 in Portland, Oregon, and smaller groups in Richmond, Oakland, San Jose, and Long Beach, California. Others scatter in isolated pockets. Mien sense their history must be preserved--recorded in English--or it will be lost. One Mien says, 'I am very positive the Mien will lose their traditional religion within the next ten years. There will be no more shamans (religious leaders). There will be no more scroll.'"" (page 226)


As a humanitarian gesture Mr. Jerry Thompson, a real estate agent with residency in San Francisco's China-town once offered to lease land that he owned in West Virginia to 250 Mien for a nominal sum of money. The outcry against this resettlement (led by the County Sheriff) was so great that the project was abandoned. Kouei Choy Saechao said, ""It is very important for the Mien people to preserve their culture and customs, we have to have a place to go. The Laotians did not expect their children to be able to work their way out of dependency on government welfare programs if they are unable to get some land."" (See Asian Week, 2/24/83)


Mien like Hmongs lament the rapid Americanization of their children and loss of the heritage and traditions they brought over from Laos. This reminds me of the same lamentation the first-generation Chinese had for their offspring in America, that they were too Americanized also. I think we have to trust the young people and in spite of all the exposure to Americanization, if they have the intelligence, they can become good Americans and still retain their Asian culture. Miens, Hmongs, Laotians or Cambodians can do the same for their descendants.


Rehabilitation of Southeast Asians


Like all wars of ages past, it is so easy to destroy but so difficult to rebuild. The Vietnam War was over in 1975, and it will take the rest of this century to reconstruct and rehabilitate, whether in Southeast Asia, or for the refugees to rebuilt their lives in the United States. The ""road back"" is a difficult one for all refugees in a new environment, a new culture and in a new country.


I visited a refugee camp in Hong Kong shortly after the ""boat people"" arrived in 1980. I returned to the camp in 1982; many of the camps have closed. The refugees are now resettled in the Western World, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Europe and in the People's Republic of China. After we bombed and destroyed their countries in Laos, Cambodia, North and South Vietnam, are we doing the right thing to scatter these people all over the world? Here in the United States are we doing the right thing to scatter them all over the 50 states? I grant the Refugee Act of 1980 was passed as a humanitarian measure which was considered at the time an emergency situation. In FY '81 the Department of Health and Human Services spent $648.6 million for refugee assistance. In FY '82 which closed on 9/30/82, it was another $500 million FY '83 will not end until 9/30/83.


Our school system is taxed to the limit teaching the refugees the English language and some marketable vocational skills. The mutual aid associations of Southeast Asian immigrants and the social service agencies are struggling to make the refugees self-sufficient and get them off the public welfare rolls. Instead of getting sympathy and understanding from the Asian communities all over the United States the refugees are not integrated in our communities. Perhaps the indigenous population has forgotten that one or two generations back, their fathers and grandfathers faced the same problems of jobs, housing, education and survival that the Southeast Asian refugees are facing in 1983.


Lest we forget, history has a strange way of repeating past events. Some people learn and profit from their past. Others don't and repeat their errors. Can we afford to repeat our mistakes?

LOS ANGELES--The Pacific Asian Alcoholism Program of L.A. has been re-awarded a contract from the Office of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, L.A. County Department of Health Services, to serve the Pacific Asian American communities.


Program Director Royal F. Morales said that the award will assist the county in the needed development and improvement of services as well as in the provision of educational programs for various groups.


""We definitely need this award to fight against the growing misuse and abuse of alcohol among youth, young adults, businessmen and professionals because of the observable incidences of alcohol-related problems. The increasing evidences are collaborated by county documents, the arrests in drunk driving and by the recent study on alcohol use pattern by Asian and Pacific Americans by Drs. Kitano and Hatanaka,"" said Morales.


Funded through the Special Service for Groups, Inc., a United Way member agency, headed by George M. Nishinaka, PAAP is one of several programs commissioned to serve various special target populations.


Last year, the program assisted in the establishment of an AA for Korean speaking people, the development of the L.A. Pacific Asian Alcohol Task Force and the development of proposals for those arrested and convicted for drinking under the influence (DUI).

""We would like the national and local civil rights commissions to hold local hearings to awaken the population to the recent wave of violence,"" Dr. Seid said. ""It would perform an educational function for the communities.""

""Lowell is one of my favorite schools,"" said George Hsu, Lowell High School Assistant Principal, who attributes that sentiment to the students. ""We get The City's cream of the crop at Lowell, and it's a pleasure to deal with these kids.""


Born in China, Hsu, Lowell's first Chinese administrator, graduated from the National ChengChi University in Taiwan where he majored in linguistics and biology. He immigrated to San Francisco 15 years ago with his wife and child and eventually secured his first job in the education field.


Hsu first worked as a community liaison worker while obtaining his teaching credential at San Francisco State University. He also received his master's degree in education at SFSU and eventually obtained his doctorate degree in the same field at the University of San Francisco. His knowledge of several Chinese dialects helped Hsu, whose liaison work required direct Chinese community contact as well as his working within the school system.


After Hsu obtained his credential, he served as a substitute teacher. He then became a long-term substitute, a probationary teacher, and eventually a regular teacher in biology and mathematics. He taught at Mission, Galileo, Woodrow Wilson and Lowell High Schools, and Herbert Hoover Middle School.


His administration assignments have included counseling at Galileo, Dean of Students at Woodrow Wilson, and in 1978 he became Lowell's Dean of Boys. In 1981 Hsu returned to Lowell as Assistant Principal.


Although at present he sees his position as fairly permanent, Hsu admitted, ""It's normal to assume that in due time the Assistant Principal may eventually become the Principal.""


Hsu enjoys working at Lowell and bears a positive attitude toward both the school and the students. ""When you have good students,"" Hsu explained, ""you have a good school. Sure, we're among the top schools in the nation, but it's really the kids themselves that make the school.""


Hsu's only drawback is the fact that despite Asians making up nearly 64 percent of Lowell's student population, there are few Asian teachers there. For this reason, Hsu stressed, ""I'd like to encourage more Asians to get into the education field.""


Expressing respect for education itself, Hsu commented, ""Without education, one can't function and one can't survive--this is especially true of immigrants."" He pointed out that many Asian immigrants come to America to further their education as well as for economic reasons.


However, he admitted that many college-educated immigrants still have job-finding difficulties because they lack the specific skills needed by some positions while their college degrees overqualify them for other employment. ""They are caught in between,"" Hsu lamented.


He recalled his own first attempts to find a job with Bank of America. ""At first I filled out an application designating that I was a college graduate. The only job available was as a messenger boy, but my interviewer said that I was overqualified for such a job.""


Hsu returned the next day and filled out another application, claiming that he was only a high school graduate, and spoke with a different interviewer. ""I told her I was interested in the messenger boy position,"" Hsu . . . but instead of hiring me, she said that she would rather give me a better job after I graduated from college.


""A lot of Asian immigrants have similar experiences.""


Despite this fact Hsu believes opportunities do exist for immigrants. ""If you work hard and get a good (and appropriate) education, there is room for any immigrant to move on in life and to grow as a person. There are basically opportunities for everyone in America.""

PHOENIX--The first Chinese-sponsored float appeared in the 12th Annual Fiesta Bowl Parade, one of the nation's 10 largest festival parades. The Chinese float was cosponsored by the Phoenix Young Chinese Association (PYCA) and Wan Fu Wine--""the French wine with an Oriental accent.""


This year's theme for the parade was ""Amigos de la Fiesta"" (Fiesta Friends). As a friend of the Fiesta Bowl, the float's theme was ""Gung Hay Fat Choy--Happy New Year.""


The float depicted a smattering of Chinese culture with a Pagoda, Lion Dance, an Emperor's Court and ribbon dancers. The colors chosen were mandarin red, Chinese gold and jade green which represented good luck and prosperity.


The traditional lion dance symbolized the banishment of all evil spirits to welcome the new year with fresh hope and renewed expectations.


Under the open air pagoda the Emperor's Court adorned the float: Susie Kwan, wearing the flower dance gown to pave the road to good fortunes with sweet rose petals; Virginia Gee and Carine Yee, the modern maidens of the court, wore the modern versions of a traditional and graceful cheongsam.


Flanking the float during its entire course through downtown Phoenix were eight young ribbon dancers, waving their scarves to the gracefully choreographed version of the modified 16th Century Ming Dynasty Ribbon Dance.


A record crowd of more than 300,000 spectators lined the route of the parade to view the Chinese float along with the 30 other colorful floats and marching bans. In addition more than eight million people throughout the nation watched the syndicated broadcast on national television.


The float won the Queen's Trophy, which was awarded to the most beautiful entry in the Commercial Division. It is the first time for a Chinese organization to enter in any parade in Arizona. Their hard work and diligence in preparing the float paid off nicely.

BEAVERTON, Oreg. -- ""For the last 15 years I've been a professional manager/invester of county and municipal funds. As state treasurer, I wouldn't need the on-the-job training an unskilled politician would. It's time we elected a professional to this position, not a politician.""


So says David Chen as he launches his first bid for public office, as treasurer for the state of Oregon.


Director of Finances for the city of Beaverton for the past six years, he not only straightened out the accounts after an auditing firm had reported deficiencies in the city's budgeting and accounting methods, but also won the Certificate of Conformance twice for the city.


The certificate is the ""highest form of recognition in the area of governmental financial reporting,"" according to the Municipal Finance Officers Association, which presented Beaverton with its first award in 1979.


""A major part of our economic destiny lies in Pacific Rim trade. I can bring to that challenge an intimate knowledge of Asian governments, people and languages...a knowledge missing in state government today,"" Chen said.


""Oregon's location and its geography makes it a state attractive to Pacific Rim trade,"" Chen said. ""Rivers, ports and railroads all make the state accessible and we have numerous products that we should promote more to the Asian countries. There are the timber industry, agricultural products, electronic products and coal.


""The state's economy has been hit more severely than other states in the last few years so we have to do things to revitalize it's income. Another thing is to invest more money inside the state...generate jobs by supplementing local sources of venture capital.""


Chen is one of seven candidates seeking this office, and is among four Republicans on the ticket. Born and raised in Nanking, China, he received his bachelor's degree in public administration from the National Chung Hsing University.


Immigrating to the U.S. in 1963, he obtained a B.A. in mathematics from the University of Washington and furthered his studies with a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. His special study areas were international relations and comparative governments.


He worked as a foreign exchange trader at a bank in Seattle for three years before joining local government. As a professional government administrator, he is engaged by financially troubled local governments to balance their books and help revive the economy.


He has worked in local governments in Delaware and Washington besides Oregon and Alaska, where he was presented the key to the city of Kenai for his work as the city's treasurer and finance director. Residents of the city also dedicated a ""David Chen Day"" in his honor.


""Traditionally, the job of state treasurer has been seen as a political stepping stone,"" Chen said. ""Now the voters' attitudes are changing, the environment is changing and people want the state treasurer to be more a professional than a politician. That's the most important thing.""


Chen pointed out that he is the only professionally qualified in the field of finances, as well as the first Asian in the history of the state to run for state office.


""I'd like to see the state tresurer take an active role in the economic development of the state, rather than hiding behind the scenes as a book-keeper,"" he said.


Although his campaign efforts began about two months ago, Chen will formally announce his candidacy on Oct. 21 in Portland. He noted that he has the support of the majority of the Asian community in Oregon, as well as professionals and government employees, and is confident of a victory in the primaries, which will be held in May 1984. ""We're going to come out winning,"" he quipped.


Beaverton is one of the five largest cities in Oregon with a population of about 250,000 in the greater metropolitan area. 1980 Census estimates that there are about 35,000 Asians in the state although Chen be lieves that this figure is close to 60,000.


He hopes that this election would bring the various Asian communities together to form a stronger political coalition.


Chen urged Asians to take a mroe active role in the political arena, stressing that Asians have to be more visible in all levels of government.

LONG BEACH--This port city at the southern end of the Los Angeles County coastline has become the home of the largest Cambodian population anywhere outside of Cambodia, and more Southeast Asian refugees continue to migrate into the town as stories spread about the good conditions here.


The refugee population here has swelled from 3,633 during the 1980 Census to nearly 20,000, according to Maria La Ganga of the Los Angeles Times. The newcomers are having a profound effect on the face of the city.


The population estimates of Southeast Asian groups in Long Beach are as follows:


Cambodian--8,756


Vietnamese--3,999


Vietnamese Chinese--3,016


Laotian--429


Hmong--1,201


Mien--425


Total--17,826


The estimates were compiled by the Long Beach Department of Public Health, studying the numbers of refugees receiving governmental assistance, enrollment in English as a Second Language courses and other indicators.


The Southeast Asians are concentrated in northern sections of the city near where the Long Beach and Artesia freeways meet, and in south central Long Beach between 7th Street and Pacific Coast Highway. The heaviest concentration--known as the ""landing area"" by the Department of Public Health--is the neighborhood bounded by California, Anaheim, Redondo and 7th streets.


La Ganga reported the neighborhood's hub of activity is 10th Street, where a number of Asian grocery stores and other businesses are located. This neighborhood was targeted in the DPH study for particular attention.


The report found that in the eastern half of that area ""the stability of the neighborhood may be in jeopardy. Rents and housing values have not kept pace with the rest of the city. Overcrowding has surpassed the mean by a small margin. The number of people receiving welfare is above normal.""


The western half of the targeted area has seen the greatest impact, according to the report. With a 30 percent increase in population since 1970, ""a three-fold increase in overcrowded units has occurred, so that the rate now is four times the citywide average. Participation in welfare programs is nearly 2 1/2 times the average for the city ... and the enormous increase in school age children is having considerable impact on the school system, particularly since many children probably do not speak English.""


The area was formerly heavily populated by blacks and Hispanics, according to La Ganga. Competition between the refugees and other low-income groups for public housing assistance has grown stiff, resulting in a two-year waiting list.


Though a number of the refugees have had success with businesses or have otherwise made their way well in the American system, many others are finding themselves unable to make a go of it without assistance.


There are almost 10,400 Southeast Asians on some form of governmental assistance in Long Beach. La Ganga reported that many of these cannot afford to work for the low wages offered them without endangering their welfare benefits.


""Sometimes they get $3.35 an hour,"" said Pao Yang, secretary of the Hmong Association. ""They have nine children to take care of. If they work more than 100 hours, welfare is cut off, so welfare is better."" La Ganga wrote that a welfare recipient with nine children could qualify for $1,080 per month in benefits plus $150 in food stamps and Medi-Cal coverage. Working 40 hours a week at minimum wage would only bring in about $600.


Even those refugees with work experience which would qualify them for higher-paying jobs are finding that their poor English skills bar them from many positions, especially during periods of high unemployment.


Long Beach City College now offers 55 sections of ESL courses, split into regular, preliterate and vocational language classes. The division is necessary because many of the refugees have had no education at all. Jim Martois, director of the Refugee Assistance Project run by the Long Beach Unified School District, said 12 percent of the program's students have had no formal education and 18 percent are illiterate in their native languages.


LBCC has 4,800 refugees taking ESL courses, and another 1,551 are studying at Long Beach School for Adults, with waiting lists totaling more than 2,000 to get into the various ESL programs.


But though the refugees have presented a new set of problems to be solved, the impact on the city's resources has been minimal. Mayor Thomas Clark told La Ganga that most of the services needed by the refugees come from federally or state-funded programs administered by Los Angeles County.


""Also, we haven't had any higher crime rate, and they would appear to be good citizens and making an effort, through the schools mostly, to become assimilated into the community,"" Clark said.


And the cultural contributions of the refugees have received attention also. The celebrations of Cambodian and Vietnamese New Years have become regular parts of the calendar, according to Judith Luther, a founding member of Heritage Asian Pacific, Inc. Art and theater from Southeast Asia are also becoming more familiar to Long Beach, she said.

The San Francisco Chronicle recently said this was the Year of the Rat in the Chinese calendar.


The same newspaper then referred to Court of Appeal Justice Harry Low as a municipal court judge.


Finally, the Chronicle reported that Chinese New Year would begin last Friday night at midnight, when in fact the holiday was to begin Saturday night.


Our colleagues at the Chronicle are a bit behind the times. Ignoring the fact that Asian Americans make up as much as one-fourth of The City's population, a proportion which is still growing rapidly, the Chronicle persists in passing off the Asian American community as an insignificant segment of its readership unworthy of the usual standards of professional journalistic practice.


The 1980 U.S. Census showed that Asian Americans make up 21.7 percent of The City's population. In an interview published in USA Today on Oct. 15, 1982 Mayor Dianne Feinstein said Asians were 25 percent of the people of San Francisco. Asians make up nearly 40 percent of the student population in San Francisco's public schools (see Asian Week, 2/10/83), the largest racial bloc in the student population, and are expected to form an absolute majority within a few years.


But the Chronicle has ignored these facts.


Any professional newspaper should be expected to at least assign one reporter to ""work the beat"" in a community which comprises one of every four people in the city it serves, if not to actively educate its entire editorial staff on the importance of that community and encourage further study of it. Such action is essential to the guarantee of accuracy in its reporting, and without the guarantee of accuracy a newspaper forfeits its reason for being.


But the Chronicle has undertaken no such effort to familiarize itself with the Asian Americans of its readership. In fact its reporters, columnists and editors have shown an inability to report correctly even the most readily accessible facts about Asian Americans and their cultures.


Chronicle columnist Stanton Delaplane blundered in his Jan. 19 ""Happy New Year"" column, in which he identified the coming 12 months as the Year of the Rat, which does not actually begin until next year.


In a humorous explanation of the legend of the 12 animals who answered the call of Buddha, Delaplane wrote that ""the Rat was the last to sign up."" The actual legend places the Rat first, and the Boar came last.


Delaplane also wrote that President Ronald Reagan was one of those born in the Year of the Rat. Reagan was actually born in the Year of the Boar.


So it is apparent that Delaplane remembered much of the information put out in press releases concerning the Year of the Boar but didn't consider the subject matter important enough to check the facts about the basic premise for his entire column that day.


Sloppy journalism, at the very least.


Similarly, Chronicle columnist Myra Zellerbach, in a piece about the artistic doodling of various celebrities, identified Justice Harry Low as a municipal court judge, despite the fact that he had been a Superior Court judge for many years and had recently been confirmed as the presiding justice of the Fifth District Court of Appeal in San Francisco.


Now, Justice Low's appointment was a great victory for the Asian American community not only in San Francisco but throughout the state of California. The community had fought long and hard for his appointment, and his confirmation was front-page news in the Asian American press.


Zellerbach's error not only shows professional ineptitude on the part of both her and the Chronicle editor who looked over her column before publication, but also points up the tendency for the Chronicle to ignore sensitive issues of great importance to the Asian American community.


The most flagrant example of this neglect of Asian Americans came on page 5 of the Chronicle's Friday, Feb. 11 edition. There, under a black and white illustration of a boar, was a bold headline reading ""Year of the Boar Begins Tonight,"" followed by a story saying the celebrations would begin at midnight.


The story was 24 hours too early.


These three errors cast doubt upon the Chronicle's credibility, the very foundation upon which any newspaper is built. Now, errors are common, and we know of no newspaper which has not made a few. However, the Chronicle itself is telling the world that the ""facts"" in any of its stories on subjects outside the realm of Caucasian American society are not to be believed unless verified with a second source.


We would urge the Chronicle editorial staff to take the Asian American community more seriously than it has in the past. Their flagrant neglect of this increasingly important segment of the San Francisco ""melting pot"" strongly indicates an unwillingness to assign any importance to any but Anglo-Saxon ideals and traditions.

Take one healthy newborn baby with black hair and dark complexion. Name him or her after a famous Asian, a relative or some positive characteristic, such as longevity or prosperity.


Bring the little one home to a house full of bustling relatives, who all describe their experiences of parenthood, and their children's ailments and accomplishments.


Spend endless hours waiting for the little one to go to sleep, then wait for the little one to wake up.


Marvel over the good job Mother Nature does creating tiny hands that grab, a whale of an appetite and an endless need for clean diapers.


Sing a mixture of Asian children's songs and Mother Goose rhymes and speak baby talk in several languages to this budding linguist.


Surround the crib with Asian baby pictures, colorful toys and soft dolls and animals.


Watch him or her grow before your very eyes, with just the right amount of caring ignoring, playing, disciplining and hugging.


Develop recipes for favorite baby foods such as mashed tofu, mashed banana, mashed peas, rice soup, apple juice, chicken or fish (already chewed by mom). Later, introduce: frozen bagels for teething, misoshiru, watered-down green tea, rakkyo, takuan and the wonderful array of sticky sembei rice crackers. And watch the poking and lifting process of learning to use chopsticks (and the baby's insistence on pouring their own shoyu).


Watch the little wonder baby begin to crawl, sit up and then take those precarious first steps. Don't pick him or her up every time they fall. Just rub the little bumped heads, skinned knees and say. ""Itai, ne.""


Introduce the tyke to family picnics with potato chips and onigiri. Watch the kid wade in cold tide pools, chase a butterfly, wave at trains, push elevator buttons, lose helium balloons, poke Jell-O with a fork, get milk from a machine, pick peas from your own vine, honk the car horn and watch people jump, punch a hole with a hole punch in Daddy's office or write his own name on an electric typewriter.


Puzzle at where Ojiichan get his endless patience when explaining how you catch a fish and watch Obaachan break all the ""no sweets"" rules you've set.


Of course, you can't expect the baby to be happy every minute. The temper tantrums, the inability to communicate important wishes, the misunderstandings, the fears of Halloween masks and dark rooms come, too.


But the singing, the learning to express things, the curiosity at why someone's hair is black and someone's isn't or why someone talks or writes ""different"" -- and the smiles -- are what's worth it. The next generation is coming up, folks, no question about that. Many couples who swore never to stretch this planet's resources by creating another mouth to fill are reconsidering, because maybe there is something to having a little one grow up under your own roof, learning about your heritage and facing the future, no matter what it may bring.


It's all a challenge, but what's life without a challenge -- and one which brings tangible results at that. What could be more tangible than watching a two-year old eat an ice cream cone on a hot day wearing his or her best outfit?

LOS ANGELES -- The air is filled with the sweet scents of lemon grass, chives and melon flowers and all around the fields are snow peas, persimmon trees, winter melons and a large variety of Oriental squash, cabbages and beans.


Not just your everyday vegetable garden, the crops raised on the 43-acre Taiwan Farms cater exclusively to California's large Asian American population. Owned by Henry and Judy Hsiao, the farm is located at the northern edge of San Juan Capistrano and can only be reached by dirt roads.


""We sell our crops in Los Angeles,"" Henry told Bill Billiter of the LA. Times. With his wife and son, he immigrated from Taiwan to the U.S. in 1973. Taking a job as a computer programmer with a Santa Monica company, they made their home in Laguna Hills.


""When I was in school in Taiwan, I studied agriculture,"" Judy said. ""So I planted a garden in our backyard. I grew flower chives, which were hard to find.""


In a short time fellow Asian immigrants, as well as native Asian Americans were offering to buy the spicy plants she was harvesting. It was then that she realized the potential of her hobby.


""In 1979 we started looking for a farm,"" said Judy. ""Everyday Henry would read the ads in the newspaper. That is how we found the farm that year and bought it.""


The farm cost $1 million, an enormous sum for a new immigrant at a new job. ""But the owner of the land helped me to finance it,"" he said.


It was decided that Oriental vegetables and fruits be grown needs of the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos and Vietnamese.


""We had to work very hard that first year,"" said Judy. ""Only Henry and I were workers the first year. We had to do everything. We planted only six acres, and when people asked, Where are your machines? 'I would tell them, 'I am the machine. I do the planting.'""


In 1980 Henry quite his computer programming job in order to devote more time to the farm. Acreage under cultivation was expanded and they started hiring workers.


""Henry designed the water (irrigration) system and runs all the machinery; that is how we save a lot of money,"" Judy said. She added that even with 30 workers, she and her hushand work 12-hour days at the year-round business, but not all of it is on the farm. ""We have to do a lot of work at home studying books and doing research.""


Henry said the farm has been breaking even, and whatever profits earned are immediately used toward buying equipment and expanded planting.

Not very long ago an old black-and-white movie was shown on Channel 20 called ""Back to Bataan."" It told the epic story of literally a ""handful"" of Filipino and American soldiers fighting side by side, holding on to their ground, in the face of numerically superior forces and tremendous odds to upset the enemy in defense of freedom and democracy, in World War II.


The movie was filmed on location, in Bataan province, Philippines, where the brave Filipino and American soldiers fought a losing battle. Bataan fell into enemy hands on April 9, 1942.


Historians call it, ""Victory in defeat. The triumph of the cause of freedom!""


General Douglas MacArthur, writing in a historical journal, said, ""There was a makeshift army of Filipinos and Americans who fought an epic battle that is now part of history. Theirs was a story written in agony and blood. They went down in defeat--but defeat that crowned them in deathless glory, and hollowed for all time a Philippine peninsula, until then unknown to the world.


""Bataan, with Corregidor the citadel of its integral defense, made possible all that has happened since. History, I am sure, will record it as one of the decisive battles of the world. Its long protracted struggle enabled the United Nations to gather strength to resist in the Pacific. Had it not held out, Australia would have fallen with incalculably disastrous results ... The Bataan garrison was destroyed due to its dreadful handicaps, but no army in history more thoroughly accomplished its mission. Let no man henceforth speak of it other than as of a magnificent victory!""


The first Bataan Day was celebrated in San Francisco on April 9, 1963. It was initiated by the Filipino American Society of California, of which your humble correspondent was one of the organizers, first vice president and public relation officer. The affair was something San Franciscans would not easily forget. April 9, 1963, was proclaimed ""Bataan Day"" in the City and County of San Francisco by then Mayor George Christopher. A similar proclamation was issued by Governor Edmund G. Brown. It was given wide coverage in the newspapers and on TV and radio stations.


I could never forget that Bataan Day Memorial Banquet held at the Sheraton Palace Hotel in San Francisco. One of the honored guests was none other than retired U.S. Army Captain Jose Calugas, the first Filipino recipient of America's highest award--the Congressional Medal of Honor. He won that coveted medal for ""Conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy at Culis, Bataan province, Philippines, January 16, 1942.


I was supposed to make a speech that night at the banquet. I was introduced by the Master of Ceremonies as the ""moving spirit"" behind the celebration, and the audience, an admixture of American businessmen and their wives, former soldiers who saw action in the Pacific, Filipino Americans, Chinese Americans, Italian Americans, Hindus and other nationalities, all responded by cheering and applauding. I was seated at the head table with my wife wearing her best mestiza dress called ""Balintawak"" sitting beside me who was also applauding.


I stood up slowly and walked to the microphone on the stage. I had a yellow piece of paper in my hand on which was written something that made me all nervous and excited. I looked at the thing in my hand and then I said to the audience, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I've decided to forego my speech.""


The audience stirred, murmurs and whisperings were heard, and one bearded, well dressed man seated at a table in front of the stage remarked, rather sarcastically, ""Ah, you forgot your speech, eh?"" and laughed. Others laughed with him.


""Nothing of the sort,"" I replied with a chuckle. ""I just don't want to bore you with my speech. Besides, I got something in this yellow piece of paper I am holding (I raised my hand and waved it for everybody to see) that is more important than my speech. With your permission, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to read it to you.""


The same man sitting at the table in front of the stage said, ""Go right ahead. We'd like to hear it.""


I put on my reading glasses and commenced to read what was on the yellow piece of paper which should be obvious to the audience now as a telegram. I read slowly, haltingly, pronouncing every word carefully, and with emphasis. For it was an important telegram from a very important person lauding the initiative behind the celebration of Bataan Day in San Francisco, and extending the sender's best wishes to the organizers.


After I read the telegram, I paused. I didn't say who it was from. The people in the audience were so quiet, waiting. There wasn't a stir, not a sound. Oh, you could drop a pin and hear it. Everybody was waiting for me to tell who the sender of the telegram was. For sixty seconds--I held the audience in suspense. First, I removed my reading glasses, wiped it and placed it in the case. Next, I folded the telegram and gave the audience a sweeping glance before I readjusted the microphone and brought it to the same level as my mouth and then, in as clear and as loud a voice as I could muster, I said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the sender of the telegram I just read ... (I paused a half second) ... was none other than Mr. John F. Kennedy, President of the United States!""


That brought the house down. The audience rose as one man--the applause was so loud, long and so resounding you would think the walls of the banquet hall would come crumbling down and crushing the people inside. Oh, I couldn't believe they would give me a standing ovation, as if I were the President of the United States himself who had come to deliver a rousing speech. It was my crowning moment of glory.


There had been other Bataan Day celebrations that followed after that. But none could compare, none had the glint or the glamour of the first Bataan Day held in San Francisco on April 9, 1966.

My mother used to chide me


""Don't stay under the sun!


So you don't turn black


Go take a bath


Scrub yourself well


So the white will come out""


by Mars Estrada


Estrada told the audience at the celebration of Philippine Independence Day last Sunday that the above poem was written in contemplation of the history of colonialism in the Philippines--300 years of Spanish rule, nearly 50 years of American rule, and continued dominance of Philippine affairs by the U.S.


But the verse could well have been inspired by the Filipino American experience. First imported to the U.S. as cheap labor and later shunned when he asserted his right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the Filipino American has been damned when he tried to maintain his ethnic identity and damned when he tried to become part of White America.


The celebration of Philippine Independence Day was not all as gloomy as Estrada's poem might suggest. On the contrary, there was a great deal of singing and playing of music, the joyful carving and eating of a roast pig, an exhibition of color photographs taken in the Philippines by Patrick Salaver and more.


The event was held at the South of Market Cultural Center. The South of Market area was recently called the new Manilatown by the Bay Guardian, replacing the Manilatown of old which was pushed out by the expansion of the Financial District.


In low-cost housing wedged in amongst countless warehouses and industrial buildings live an estimated 5,000 Filipino Americans, reportedly the highest concentration anywhere in The City. But repeating the past, developers are looking to build office towers, hotels and other new commercial structures in the South of Market area, which developers see as the Last Frontier in San Francisco.


The Filipino community seems to lack the unity necessary to make a strong stand against the developers. That lack of unity was evident at the Independence Day celebration--not more than 50 people were on hand at any one time during the four-hour festivities.


. . . Bocobo-Balunsat, the initiator and coordinator of the annual Philippine American Cultural Week since its inception 10 years ago, said the preservation and promotion of Filipino culture in America is difficult.


""If we had announced we were having a beauty contest and a dance, we could have had a big crowd here. But when it comes to our native culture, not as many people are interested,"" Bocobo-Balunsat said.


""There is so little recognition for Filipino culture here in America. That is why I started the Philippine American Cultural Week 10 years ago. We have so many talented writers, artists and performers, but few people are aware of the culture and so there is no market for Filipino talent in this country.""


Provincialism, pride and the quest for prestige stand in the way of the unity of the Filipino community, she said. ""We have 300 Filipino organizations in the Bay Area, and each one has its own territory and activities. And if someone runs for president of an organization but doesn't win, he might just break off and form a new organization so he can be president of that one.


""So many people are searching for the prestige that comes with organizational titles that we can't get together as one . . . group. That's why I am not affiliated with any of the clubs or organizations,"" Bocobo-Balunsat said. ""If I was, perhaps nobody would show for these annual activities!""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Reaction among Filipinos in San Francisco to the White House annoucement of President Reagan's cancellation of a visit to the Philippines in November was for the most part joyful, though some expressed a cautious wait-and-see attitude.


""I'm delighted at the cancellation of the visit,"" said opposition leader Steve Psinakis. ""This belated decision by Reagan was forced upon him by the people, and we must emphasize that this message to the people of the Philippines comes not from Reagan but from the American people.


""The impact will be tremendous when the Filipinos hear of the outrage of the American people. It might in fact be the best thing that has ever happened to restore Filipinos' faith in America,"" Psinakis added.


Jerry Bautista, a board member of the Filipino American Council of San Francisco, said he and other members of the council had been concerned about the question of whether adequate security could be provided for Reagan during a visit to Manila. Despite supposedly tight security at the Manlia airport when Benigno Aguino returned to the Philippines on Aug. 21, he was assasinated within moments of leaving the plane.


""I didn't want Reagan to go to the Philippines,"" Bautista said. ""If something had happened to him while he was there, it would have rebounded against all the Filipinos here in the United States. The situation is very turbulent there, and it is not going to get better for a while.""


Nina Raymundo, president of the council, did not address the question of whether Reagan's canncellation amounted to an abandonment of the Marcos regime. ""The President has his reasons for cancelling, and I think we should respect his judgment.""


Raymondo also refused to be drawn into either a pro or anti-Marcos stance: ""We have seen the good things Marcos has done, but we do not hold our loyalty to a person but rather to the good of the people. People claim he is a tyrant or a dictator, but they can also see the good things he has done for the Philippines.


Psinakis predicted that Reagan's cancellation might not only help pave the way for a peaceful return to democracy in the Philippines, but would also have a substantial impact on Filipinos in the U.S.


""Many of the Filipino immigrants who have firmly established themselves here in this country will stay, and I think there will be more unity within the community. But many of those who came here temporarily to avoid the oppression back home will probably return to the Philipines if and when democracy is restored.""


Psinakis said he was ""convinced that Marcos cannot recover"" from the loss of face resulting from Reagan's cancellation, and would be forced to ""restore the rights of the Filipino people without bloodshed.""


""It's a big victory for us all,"" he said. ""We've worked day and night for this.""

We were treated like war prisoners. If I wanted to go see a friend in another block. I had to get a soldier to go with me.""

""To restart again after the war's end was very tough."" It was a lot of long days and long nights. We worked very hard.""


--Mae Ishihara, former state employee


Forty years later, the Washington State Legislature has decided to amend a wrong against Japanese American state employees.


On May 13, the governor signed into a law a bill providing $5,000 compensation to Japanese Americans who were dismissed from or resigned from state employment during World War II because of the evacuation order. The compensation bill passed the Senate on March 9 by a strong vote of 35 to 11, and the House on May 6 by an uncomfortably close margin of 57 to 37.


The bill recognized the ""grave injustice done to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry"" when these people were forced to abandon their homes and belongings, only to be placed in relocation camps during World War II. According to a recent report by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, there was not a single documented act of espionage or sabotage by any of the 120,000 Japanese Americans interned. Indeed, this internment, unconstitutionally depriving 120,000 of their rights without due process, without trial or hearing, is one of the blackest marks in our country's history.


The State of California and Los Angeles County have already passed similar legislation to compensate Japanese American employees. The City and County of San Francisco are in the process of doing likewise. Because Washington State was one of several states to have an internment camp, and because California had successfully proven that it could enact legislation to compensate Japanese Americans who were wrongfully dismissed from state employment, the question of our state adopting a similar measure arose.


Frank Irigon, affirmative action officer in the State's Department of Personnel, did some initial research. In September, 1982, a core group was formed to pursue the issue of compensation, a group which included Ron Sims, legislative asistant to Sen. George Fleming; Tim Gojio, Senate Republican Caucus Associate Counsel, who drafted the bill; Ruth Woo; and Cherry Kinoshita, Seattle Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) coordinator of the State Bill Committee. Priscilla Ouichida, legislative assistant to California Assemblyman Patrick Johnson, provided additional advice.


Rep. Art Wang, Sen. George Fleming, and Rep. Gary Locke began additional background work and sought bipartisan support for bills in both houses. The JACL and the Washington Coalition on Redress also initiated intense lobbying efforts, seeking support from numerous organizations, making dozens of phone calls, writing several letters and constantly visiting lawmakers in Olympia to discuss the measure. Cherry Kinoshita, acting as chief legislative liason for both bills, did a tremendous and conscientious job of thoroughly explaining the measure to legislators.


With the diligent and skillful influence of Sen. Fleming, majority caucus chairman, and the dedication of his legislative assistant, Ron Sims, the bill overwhelmingly passed the Senate on March 9, 35 to 11.


Surprising opposition surfaced against the measure in the House during the special session. Supportive legislators and lobbyists had to quickly rally support from those who opposed the measure or had doubts about it. Whether there were enough votes to pass the measure was in doubt each day.


The House floor debate on the measure was intense and emotional. Many legislators relived their war memories. It was agreed that the $5,000 compensation was symbolic and a gesture. From that point of agreement, comments sharply differed. Rep. Art Wang (D-Tacoma), said of the compensation, ""The amount may be little. But it's about time that we made at least some token compensation and recognition of the losses, not only of property, but of even more basically, freedom, through losses that were paid by state employees.""


These sentiments were echoed by Rep. Gary Locke (D-Seattle), ""The amount is a gesture that has been long overdue and that indicates that this government and this state recognize the wrongs and complicity committed by this state in promoting the federal plan of putting Japanese Americans in concentration camps."" Locke also pointed out that ""for those who thought the compensation amount was too small, that was not a sufficient excuse for turning down this legislation.""


Some legislators did not see the reparation as amending the losses incurred by Japanese Americans, but as an insult and a burden. Rep. Ray Isaacson remarked to his fellow members; ""I think that you are adding insult to injury in thinking that you can buy off a conscience of the nation for a paltry $5,000. And especially with taxpayers money which we do not own, for a limited number of people that were affected.""


Although the bill only directly affects 38 people, Locke said this is not the issue: ""There have been claims raised that we are only addressing or giving aid to a very small number of people. That is true. However, we were the employers of these 38 Japanese Americans. As their employers, we must redress our wrongs.""


Another difficulty the bill encountered was that many could not distinguish between this discriminatory act of the state, toward Japanese Americans who were visibly of another nationality, and other discriminatory acts. Supporters of the bill maintained that this was an act of the state that should be corrected by the state. Others saw it differently like Rep. Dickie, ""I don't think we can go back and give dollars for each time we've seen an injustice done. I don't think that is the responsibility of a future generation to repay the debts of the past. I think that responsibility is to assure ourselves it will not happen in the future.""


Supporters reiterated that we were at war with Japan not the Japanese, that many Japanese Americans served in the armed services with honor and that what this country did was a crime in stripping Japanese Americans of their basic constitutional rights and as a result, caused much grief, puzzlement and heartache.


After nearly half hour of debate, it came time to consider whether the legislature should provide dompensation to those 38 state employees of Japanese descent who lost their jobs during World War II. The moment was tense as the green and red lights appeared on the House of Representatives voting board. When the Speaker of the House locked the roll call machine, the final vote of 57 to 37 glowed.


After 40 years, the Washington State Legislators had made a first step in recognizing the wrongs committed Japanese Americans during World War II. The bill begins to help other Japanese Americans who lost their jobs in Washington State during the war. Hopefully, other states will follow the examples set by Washington and California. Finally, this nation can admit that it is big enough to acknowledge that it did wrong. And that such injustice should never happen again.

SANTA ANA -- For many Asian women who have emigrated to the U.S., the exposure to American society and culture has forced them to examine their values, roles and their relationships with men. In most cases, this practice of self-inquiry is a first, and may lead to some uncomfortable situations in the home.


""Once you get married, that's your destiny, baby -- you can't change it,"" Vy Trac Do, a bilingual specialist at California State University, Fullerton, told the Santa Ana Register. In Vietnam marriage is regarded as a lifelong commitment, but ""here, the atmosphere is totally different. Here you have opportunity, so you start looking for faults in your partner.""


Conflicts arise from the sharp change between the women's traditionally submissive role in Asian society and their liberated one in American society, Vy added.


To be successful in their new environment, the Asian women find that they need to be out-spoken and aggressive. This behavior often creates problems between men and women that would not likely have surfaced back home.


Orange County mental health specialist Mai Cong noted that the change in male female relationships is largely responsible for the growing number of Indochinese who have sought mental health counseling. Many of those conflicts have resulted in divorce.


Confucian tradition has taught that the ""ideal female"" must be: ""skilled in household chores, always must show the world a smile, must talk softly and discreetly, and must be serious when with a man.""


""The daughter obeys the father, and the wife listens to her husband. You always need a man in your life to protect you,"" Vy said. If her husband dies, a woman must live with her eldest son, he added.


He also pointed out that when women work, their income is viewed as supplementing their husbands'. The woman's primary responsibility is to keep the family clothed and fed.


It is therefore ironic that it is these same attitudes that often help Vietnamese women gain success in the U.S. more quickly than their husbands,"" said Quynh Kieu, a Santa Ana pediatrician.


""The male who is educated feels it is beneath him to do blue-collar jobs,"" she said. ""Women are geared toward survival and at home are not allowed to have an ego. Even when she has a good idea, the clever woman will make it appear that it is the man's idea.""


Kieu had a pediatrics practice in Vietnam, but worked as a department store seamstress when she arrived in the U.S. in 1975. On the other hand, men would rather stay at home than accept a job of a lesser status than the one they had in Asia, she said.


""Then there is a role reversal, and the woman becomes the breadwinner. But, because it is women's work, the man may not want to watch the children or do chores. I've seen them absolutely refuse to do it.""


The women then feel guilty when their children become sick or they themselves don't have time to clean their homes, although they are already worn-out from earning a living for their family.


""The woman will not want to look deeply at the problem,"" Kieu said. ""She doesn't want to face the fact that it may be the husband's fault, so she continues to tolerate it and suffer.""


But the mental anguish can result in a break-up, once the woman realizes that divorce is socially acceptable in the U.S., Kieu said. In Vietnam ""people see (a marriage break-up) as her fault -- how could she do this to her husband? Here, her employer doesn't care, and she is not a social outcast.""


But Vo Kim Son, counselor at the Vietnamese Community of Orange County in Westminster, feels that the woman who ""goes overboard with the concept of freedom is as much to blame as the man who is unwilling to adapt.


""There is a misconception of the word 'freedom.' Vo said. ""Many think that the first thing to do to be American is to learn how to dance and to leave your husband.""


The counselors try to help the couples recognize that a compromise can be made and divorce can be avoided if they see the stress as a temporary conflict that occurs with adjustment to a new lifestyle, maintained Vy. ""But I tell them, if you don't redefine your roles, you'll continue to have a problem.""


Cong noted that most working Vietnamese women in successful marriages have managed to balance the Asian and American values.


""I am more fortunate than others to do what I perceive as my role. I want to be a Vietnamese woman, Vietnamese daughter, keep up with traditions and values,"" she said. ""At the same time I want to take advantage of the opportunities here.""


Cong does not have children but said that she still feels guilty when she can't visit her mother at least once a week or spend time with her husband because of work and community activities.


""I've always been bicultural and had the Western influence of the French, but I also have always wanted to remain traditioal. It is a struggle.""


Namphet Panichpant-M, a Lao-Thai woman who is a supervisor in the Orange County Public Health Department, said that she had always longed for equality promised in Western literature.


""I smelled freedom in the alley-ways of Hong Kong, where there were bookstores that offered Tropic of Cancer and Fanny Hill, she said.


But, it was only when she came to the U.S. that she has been able to direct her energies into her own interests, and enjoy her new freedom. This attitude has brought much disapproval from Asian men, she said.


""I do not fit the stereotype of the soft Asian woman. I have often felt like saying to (the men), 'If I were a man you would not be treating me like this.'""


Although she works and attends classes, Kim Nguyen, a former teacher, maintains the Vietnamese tradition of taking care of household chores. She leaves the ideal of freedom to her daughter and is glad that she has the opportunity to pursue this freedom in the U.S.


Nguyen added that even though the divorce rate among Vietnamese is high in the U.S., it reflects the higher status of women here.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Prominent Japanese author Kenzaburo Oe delivered a talk recently on ""Contemporary Japan as seen through Contemporary Japanese Literature,"" sponsored by the Japan Society and the Japan Foundation, that was attended by over 100 people.


Oe's writing is based upon socio-political themes and he holds a considerable international reputation. A Personal Matter and The Silent Cry are his works best known to Western readers.


His latest publication recently won the Osaragi Prize for social commentary. In its 10 years of presentation, it was the first time the prize had been awarded to a literary figure.


Oe's literary brilliance was first established with a selection from his book of short stories that won the Akutagawa Prize in 1958, one year after his graduation from Tokyo University.


Oe's writing and what he considers the ""beginning of modern Japan"" started after the war in about 1949.


""This was a period of great cultural change and a turning point."" He cites three important factors that impact postwar Japan's attitude towards an American-styled democracy:


At the core was the ""Emperor system"" upon which all society was based. He believed the system was a ""mistake,"" or more accurately translated as ""a coming to a dead end.""


After the Meiji, a model was necessary. Asia was ignored and America, France and England were looked towards for providing the ideal model. Oe calls this Western idealization a ""twisted or warped state"" and feels this prevalent attitude is a problem among politicians in Japan today.


The third factor is one that is particularly timely -- it concerns the threat of nuclear war. With the war ending in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oe urges this disaster be ""projected into the future"" and that we ""must struggle to avoid any future possibility of this happening again."" It is imperative that we ""look back in order to better look towards what actions we much take to make certain this does not happen again.""


Oe's writing keeps these themes in mind. His first book, Contemporary Games is about a village/nation and a microcosm/village set in the middle ages and modern times which are brought together based upon the above themes.


Oe spoke of the differing view of Japanese attitudes in the last 20 years. He agrees with political writer Masao Kuniko that there is ""an economic friction between Japan and America, a friction that is cultural as well.""


Even if the economic problem is solved, there is a deeper problem that the Japanese businessmen have become ""arrogant,"" Masao calls this Japan's ""Number One Syndrome."" Oe's feelings differ from his colleague's in that he terms this syndrome as one best described as ""stand up and be defiant.""


An example of this ""stand up and be defiant"" syndrome is one which concerns the problem of increased pollution over the past ten years. It has not been solved and when authorities are provoked, their answers at best are ""the economy is doing well"" and so the problem is ignored.


According to Oe, the opposite of this ""defiant syndrome"" is a word best translated as ""decency."" He remarked that the discussions of ""The Day After"" were very interesting and ""decent"" because everyone tried to understand each other's point of view. He cites this as an example of American democracy. He advises the young to look at such a discussion and learn from it.


Oe has been branded an advocate of the ""New Left."" He asserts he is ""just pro-democracy."" He hopes the youth of America and Japan ""can create a new methodology for understanding each other.""

SAN FRANCISCO--""How many tickets? Four? For you and your family. Okay, just send your passport in and we'll get the visas for you immediately."" Emile Heredia smiled as he put down the receiver. ""These are old-timers, people I've known for a long time. They always come back to use our services,"" he said.


In spite of the ups and downs of the travel market, Heredia's 24-year-old Phil-Am Travel Agency has continued to grow to become the largest. Filipino-owned travel agency in the U.S. Its success can be attributed to the loyalty of the clients and their recommendation of the travel agency to others.


A personable man who enjoys his work, Emile Heredia was born in Manila 73 years ago. He attended various schools and colleges in his home city and graduated from the University of Santo Tomas with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in 1932.


Nicknamed ""The Deer,"" Heredia was an outstanding high school athlete and set track records for the 100-, 200- and 400-meter dash. He was also given the name ""the Galloping Stallion"" in his college days. His athletic pursuits led him to participate in the Olympic Games in 1930 and 1934, at which he was the captain of the Philippine contingent.


He was also a member of the basketball team at the university which competed in the Philippines, China, Japan and other Asian countries, establishing a record of 110 games without being beaten.


Not only an outstanding athlete, Heredia was also an exceptional student. Known as one of the Top Ten mathematicians of his time, he also obtained his chemical engineering and business administration degrees from universities in Manila.


Prior to his coming to the U.S. in 1945, Heredia was general manager of Filipinas Life Insurance Co., one of the largest in the country. His first stop in the U.S. was Los Angeles, but he moved to Oakland shortly thereafter, taking on as station manager of Philippine Airlines at the Oakland . . . When PAL's international flights were temporarily discontinued, he spent much of his time developing the market for California residents to travel to the Philippines.


Heredia acquired the Phil-Am Travel Agency from Jose Casquez in 1959 and today, the agency has branch offices in Salinas, Stockton, Los Angeles and Manila.


In addition to his active role in the travel business, Heredia has also played an important role in the Filipino American community. He founded the Filipino American Political Association in 1965 to unite the Filipino American community in expressing their concerns. The organization now has different branches across the country, providing the ""recognition and representation"" that Heredia believes the community deserves.


""If you want to make progress, you have to get involved,"" Heredia said. At his travel agency he also provides a service which helps immigrants fill out the necessary forms to become residents here. He makes it a policy to have personal contact with his clients. ""To be in business, you have to be fair, never cheat,"" he advised.


He used to travel three or four times, a year to the Philippines, but has since cut down the number of visits. During the low season, a round-trip fare from San Francisco to the Philippines on Philippine Airlines could cost $890 and senior citizens get a discount price of $716.


Heredia claims that he is now semi-retired, with his daughter Marie Sheridan and son Alex assisting in the management of the agency. He and his wife are residents of San Francisco and they also have a son, Emile, Jr. in New York. Heredia devotes much of his time to his valuable stamp collection, which is reported to contain some very rare specimens.

SACRAMENTO -- The state's system for aiding refugees perpetuates dependence on welfare programs and makes it difficult for the refugees to accept gainful employment, according to the Office for Refugee Services.


""If a refugee is referred to a job where the salary is at entry level and is less than their (welfare) grant, they don't have to take that,"" said Byron Smith, chief of the ORS, according to UPI. ""Something's wrong that we don't have some mechanism to deal with that.""


Smith told the Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement and Immigration that more than half of the 284,000 refugees in California are thus locked into the welfare system for now.


Smith also noted that about one-fourth of the state's refugees have come here from other states because the welfare payments in California are higher.


He said 109,000 refugees in the state are supported entirely by the federal government because they have been in the U.S. less than three years. Of the remaining 175,000, about 152,000 are on the state Aid to Families with Dependent Children welfare rolls.


Assemblyman Art Agnos (D-San Francisco) expressed concern that funding that might be better used for job training is going to pay for such services as childcare and transportation.


Smith said the state has contracts with 64 agencies to train refugees in English and work skills.

Can you remember when the International Examiner first came out? I can. I read the paper up at the office of the International District Youth Council (IDYC). It was quite a trip reading an Asian American newspaper produced in Seattle. Most of the ""Movement"" news always seemed to come up from the Bay Area or the East Coast.


Most of the important community issues in those early days were covered in the monthly editions of the International Examiner. Volunteers for the newspaper always seemed to be out covering events -- demonstrations, meetings of housing and social service advocates, public hearings -- the Examiner was always there to tell the community what was happening that would affect people's lives. And it did a good job.


I can remember those early years of the District when the community was in transition. Not all of those pleasant and unpleasant memories made their way into the newspaper.


One afternoon, I walked out of IDYC with several people. ""Look over there,"" one person said, pointing into the distance. ""That's where the Dome is gonna be!"" I thought to myself, ""That close?"" In those days before the construction of the Kingdome; few of us really had an idea that the Kingdome was going to be so huge. As it rose, we watched it block out the view. Some were afraid the structure would cast a shadow on the International District. I'm glad to say it didn't; but it did raise the rents in the District hotels and caused a few tense moments of concern over whether the community would survive as a neighborhood and cultural center for Asians.


When we at the International District Emergency Center went on patrol through the District, one spot we always checked was Hillside Park. In the early days, nobody in their right mind would be caught up there. Several times, I wondered what we were doing in all those blackberry bushes. Back in 1973, that location was an overgrown hillside with one picnic table overgrown with black-berry bushes. Now it's Kobe Terrace Park.


For the longest time, Hing Hay Park didn't have a pagoda, just bricks, Prior to that, the spot was just a mud pit.


The A.D. Building once stood where Rainier Bank now stands. There were several houses on that same site, but people liked the houses so much that they carted them off!


Uwajimaya, now located at South King Street, used to be up on Main Street, along with the New Eagle and Empire Hotels. That spot on main Street now has parking lots.


People used to party at the New Chinatown near Sixth and Main.


A federally funded ""turn key"" housing project was being built at the northeast corner of Sixth and Main. It made you feel that all those boring meetings were paying off.


In the back of the minds of some people was the draft; the Vietnam War was in its final stages. We used to sweat watching the selection of numbers for the draft on television.


The food bank at IDYC opened every Tuesday and Friday. I remember setting up all the food with Annie Galarosa and then waiting for the onslaught of people. Only one person showed up. But soon, through word of mouth, people learned about the food bank, and 300 people would wait in line each time IDYC opened it up.


Students from the colleges, high schools and junior highs would come down to volunteer at the many social service agencies in the International District.


During holiday season, we made decorations for all the hotels in the District, working in 20 degree weather. People took shifts folding up books. Half would fold while the other half defrosted their hands. Then we would head off to the hotels, like the Freeman on King Street with all its dark hallways, or the New Central on Weller Street with some of the most interesting tenants in the International District.


Many of the improvements in the District have occurred because our different ethnic communities have united into a single voice. Just by walking around the District, you can see the results of all those countless meetings, demonstrations, workshops, hearings and bull sessions. In 1973, the District was still a dying area. Hotels were rapidly failing to meet building and fire codes. People had nowhere to move. Small family-owned stores were closing. Sidewalks were in dire need of repair. Alleyways were filled with booby traps. People went through the District without knowing it as a community. Social services serving our elderly were few. In short, it didn't seem like a livable community.


The Examiner has carried the issues to the people and has educated the broader community about what has really been going on in the International District and Asian communities. Those in power always seem to respond faster if they see a major issue affecting people covered in the newspaper.


The next time you're in the District, take a good look around you. See all those hotels being fixed up, new sidewalks, lighting, new shops, restaurants, parks, agencies, people. The International District is becoming a community again. We've come a long way these past 10 years. The next 10 years ought to be just as lively. The paper will be there to cover it all, so you'll read about it.

Harry Lee, sheriff of Jackson Parish


Picture a tall, husky Southern sheriff all decked out in cowboy gear. Boots, spurs, cowhide vest and a wide-brimmed white Stetson. Yup, can't miss that drawl--it's Harry Lee, the only Chinese American sheriff in the land.


Lee, a 6-foot, 260-pound native of Louisiana, is sheriff of Jefferson Parish in the greater metropolitan area of New Orfeans, which has a population of about 450,000.


Growing up in New Orleans, Lee attended public schools and received his bachelor's degree in geology from Louisiana State University. He did a brief stint in the Air Force before managing the family restaurant, The House of Lee.


In 1964 Lee obtained his law degree from Loyola University and in 1971 became a federal magistrate. He resigned from this position in 1975 to run for sheriff, later withdrawing to work as a parish attorney. He was appointed sheriff in April 1980.


""I was bored with the judgeship,"" Lee said candidly in a telephone interview. ""Everything was the same every day. I like to get involved with problems before they happen; that's why this is such a fun job. It's a powerful job.""


As sheriff of Jefferson Parish Lee oversees the activities of 1,100 deputy sheriffs and his office acts as a law enforcement as well as a tax-collecting agency. ""There's something new happening every day,"" Lee said.


He estimates that there are no more than 3,000 Chinese Americans living in the New Orleans metropolitan area, with about 1,000 in his parish. ""Many of them are professionals, doctors, professors and a couple of them are interested in politics, but most stay away from it. It's not something they get into.""


Asked if more Chinese Americans should get involved in politics, Lee said, ""Everybody should do whatever they want to do but nobody should feel inhibited by the fact that they are Chinese.""


Last August the American Veterans of World War II unanimously voted to present Harry Lee with the 1983 Amvets Silver Helmet Americanism Award, an honor previously bestowed on John Wayne and President Harry S. Truman. He will be given the award at the Amvets annual silver helmet awards banquet in April.


An extremely popular man with a hearty sense of humor, Lee is married to Lai Woo, formerly of San Antonio, Texas, and has a 16-year-old daughter, Cindy. His father immigrated from China in the early 1900s. One memento that Lee has kept throughout the years is a writ of habeas corpus for his father to be released from a detention center for new immigrants, a site similar to San Francisco's Angel Island.


A long time friend of Justice Harry Low of the Fifth District Court of Appeal, the two met again recently when the judge went to New Orleans to attend a meeting of the American Bar Association, of which he is a member of the executive board. During dinner with some friends one evening, someone brought up the fact that he was in the company of the only Chinese American sheriff in the U.S. as well as the only Chinese American presiding justice in the country.


Invaderettes?


""Give me an O!"" Cheering the Oakland Invaders on when the team begins play in the newly-formed U.S. Football League will be Jennifer Galon, one of the 30 women who were chosen for the cheerleading squad.


Galon, 20, is a psychology undergraduate at the College of San Mateo and was a cheerleader at Hillsdale High School.


""This is out of the ordinary,"" Galon told a Philippine News reporter after the audition. ""It's the biggest thing I ever tried out for. The competition was based on audience appeal. It was highly different.""


A resident of Foster City, Galon was first runner-up in the 1982 Binibining Filipinas U.S.A. contest and also won the talent competition.

Still Mom's son


Former California state senator Alfred Song revealed his feelings about his mother in a recent interview with Koreatown. The first Asian legislator in the continental U.S. and the first Korean American to practice law in California, he now heads the state's Agricultural Labor Relations Board, making him the first state agency chief of Korean descent.


His mother, Chung Youn Kim, came to Hawaii as a picture-bride and worked hard to raise a family. At the age of 60 she returned to Korea to start an orphanage, after reading about the many orphans of the Korean War. The orphanage is now a high school with about 900 students.


""I am still her little boy,"" the 64-year-old lawmaker said. ""She asks me how is your blood pressure. She admonishes me to go to church. She wants to find me a nice Korean wife.""

""We are sick and tired of being guinea pigs,"" Darlene Keju says on behalf of the people of her native Micronesia, victims of United States nuclear testing and military programs for the past 38 years.


Keju, and Gifford Johnson, were in Seattle earlier this month to talk about the growing anti-nuclear and self-determination movements among Pacific Islanders.


The speaking engagement, part of a West Coast tour held in connection with an upcoming protest at Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California this month, was co-sponsored by the Washington State Commission on Asian American Affairs, the American Friends Service Committee, Pacific Peacemaker Committee and the U.S. Nuclear-Free Pacific Network.


Keju and Johnson presented a slide show and discussed the history and current social and political situations in Micronesia at the Bush-Asia Center in the International District.


Since the end of World War II, when Micronesia became a trustee of the United States under a United Nations mandate, the Islands in the South Pacific, located about 2,000 miles southwest of Hawaii, have become a fertile testing ground for nuclear weapons development and nuclear delivery systems as well as a site for nuclear waste dumping by the United States and other major world powers.


Both the controversial MX and the new Trident II missiles are scheduled to be tested this year at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands, a major chain of islands of Micronesia. The Missile Range is one of the most crucial installations for the development of first-strike strategic nuclear capability, according to a recent study released by the U.S. Nuclear-Free Pacific Network.


""Part of me is going around representing the Marshallese who are the victims of testing,"" says Keju, who was born on Ebeye Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands.


The Marshall Islanders have been the ""guinea pigs"" in the detonation of at least 66 atomic and hydrogen bombs in the 1940s and 1950s, says Johnson.


The Marshall Islanders, according to Keju, continue to suffer from the effects of those nuclear lests, ""We know we are contaminated,"" Keju says. ""We know we are dying out.""


Keju says that several tumors she has are a result of the nuclear testing in the Marshalls during that period.


The Marshallese continue to be guinea pigs, say Keju and Johnson. In recent years, the Marshall Islands have become a vital target for testing long-range missiles fired from California. This includes the new MX missiles, scheduled to have its delivery system tested by the Kwajalein Missile Range this year. The MX missiles will be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at targets near Kwajalein Island.


More than 8,000 Marshallese, as a result, have been evicted from Kwajalein and the other islands in the Marshalls and forced to live on 66 acres on nearby Ebeye Island ""in dilapidated housing amid appalling sanitary conditions,"" stated Keju and Johnson in an article which recently appeared in Pacific Magazine.


Conditions have deteriorated for the Marshallese on Ebeye Island. The Marshallese have demanded redress for being deprived of their traditional farming livelihood and being placed in overcrowded areas on the Island. The U.S. military has made the Marshallese second class citizens in their own Islands. Several protests in recent years have forced the U.S. to rectify or ameliorate some conditions while at the same time renegotiating new leases for the use of Kwajalein Island as a base.


""Our thing is to tell the people of our experience,"" Keju said, ""to make sure that what we have gone through, that you make the decision of not having it again.""

""I have a mission,"" explained Greg Chan, who took ever as bilingual coordinator for the Seattle School District in October. ""I told my staff, I told my colleagues, I have a mission. I don't care what kind of position I have. This is a program that I firmly believe in, to help poor kids, to help kids who come from a different background.


""Because when I was young, I didn't have this kind of help,"" he added.


Chan started with the district as a bilingual aide six years ago and has held a variety of positions in the program including English as a Second Language instructor, helping teacher, instructional assistant, and department head, before being appointed bilingual coordinator. He succeeds Larry Matsuda who left to become principal of an elementary school after coordinating the program for five years.


Born in China, Chan graduated from high school in Hong Kong, went to college in Taiwan, and taught in Hong Kong and Japan before coming to the United States nine years ago. He attended graduate school in Oregon, at the University of Washington, Seattle Pacific University, and is currently writing his dissertation toward his doctorate at Seattle University. ""And I'm still learning to speak English properly,"" he said.


There are 41 bilingual centers in the elementary, middle and high schools of the district, some with more than one type of bilingual service. Regular bilingual centers are for students who are up to grade level in their schoolwork but have limited English proficiency. Newcomer centers help students with limited English proficiency who received little or no prior schooling in their native country. In addition to these centers, there is an over age newcomer center for students who come to this country near the end of regular school age, but have not received much education in their native countries. The district's bilingual program also has a federally-funded Title VII Basic Project in six elementary schools to serve Lao, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese refugees.


There are currently 3,330 eligible bilingual students in the district, a number that has ""more or less stabilized"" though it was thought that the numbers would come down. ""At this time we haven't seen any dramatic changes,"" Chan said. Immigration into the United States has declined in recent years, but it is possible that the district is receiving new students who have moved here from different states.


""Our commitment is to help the student regardless of ethnic background,"" Chan said, ""We have students from Ethiopia, Latin America. We emphasize that whoever needs our help, we have to try to be 100 percent effective to help them.""


""Problems are there; there's always problems, but I think in our so called leadership role, the District is very supportive at this point to plan change to meet those problems,"" he added.


Chan credits his staff, and the leadership of the District particularly Superintendent Donald Steele, Assistant Superintendent Alice Houston and Director of Special Programs and Integration Collin Williams for being very supportive of the bilingual program. ""Money is tight all the time, but because we have good people sometimes the problems are solved, not just because of money,"" Chan explained.


""Day after day it never stops,"" Chan added. ""The staff is so patient, and there is an understanding that if we don't work on the problems, the problems will still be there.


""The Seattle bilingual program has actually been recognized as one of the better ones in the nation,"" he said, ""We still have a lot of problems, without problems there wouldn't be a program.


""Getting bigger or smaller doesn't mean too much. It's the quality that must be the best.""

OAKLAND -- The Laotian refugee community was shocked and grieved this week by the unexplained death of seemingly healthy young girl after a visit to a dental clinic.


Three-year-old Mouang Saephan, was taken by her parents, Cheng Chang and Marn Luang Saephon to a dental clinic at Children's Hospital here on Monday, Nov. 28.


After injection of a narcotic painkiller, a combination of Nisential and Phenargan, and application of nitions oxide gas, she lost consciousness. She was pronounced dead three days later, according to the S.F. Chronicle.


An autopsy failed to find the cause of death. Further laboratory test results will be out in three to six weeks.


The girl's parents said there was nothing wrong with her before she went to the dental clinic, said to be the only such clinic for refugee children in the Bay Area.


The Saephans live with other family members in a tenement in east Oakland. They have another daughter aged three months.


Many refugees said they would not week dental care at the clinic any more, and might retrain from seeking health care for any other minor illnesses.

SAN FRANCISCO--An angry group of Chinatown residents presented Mayor Dianne Feinstein with petitions containing some 2,500 signatures of people opposing the removal of Dr. Cecilia Johnson as the director of Health Center #4 in the Chinatown/North Beach area.


Dr. Johnson's removal has been ordered by Dr. Mervyn Silverman, director of The City's Health Dept., as part of a personnel rotation policy designed to help health workers grow and gain more experience.


Dr. Johnson is 64 years old and due to retire next year. Supporters say her transfer from Health Center #4 will not do much to widen her career horizons, but will serve only to rob the neighborhood of her 20 years of community involvement in the area and perhaps force Dr. Johnson into early retirement.


""We, strongly oppose this needless rotation of Dr. Johnson and we demand that she remain at Health Center #4,"" read the petition presented to the mayor.


Dr. Johnson had originally been scheduled for rotation to Health Center #5 in the Sunset District last year. Supporters lobbied the Health Dept, at that time and won a reprieve for the doctor, based on her plans to retire sometime this year.


In an Oct. 12, 1982 letter Personnel Director Edward M. Gazzano said the rotation policy would be waived for Dr. Johnson and indicated the Health Dept. would be flexible in her case.


""Should Dr. Johnson change her retirement plans, she should notify (Health Dept. officials) immediately in order that reassignment and staffing plans may be re-evaluated accordingly,"" wrote Gazzano in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Asian Week.


However, in response to Dr. Johnson's announced change in retirement plans, by which she asked to stay on until next year when she reaches 65 so she could receive full retirement and social security benefits, Dr. Silverman wrote on Feb. 28 this year that despite her 20 years of service at Health Center #4, Dr. Johnson would be reassigned to Health Center #5 in the Sunset District as of April 4.


When Dr. Johnson's transfer was first ordered last year, Dr. Chalsa Loo, an associate professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, said the policy of rotation for health center directors would hamper directors' abilities to understand the needs of their communities and develop long-range planning.


The director of social services at Cameron House, Dr. Ernest Wu added that it takes years to understand the cultural values and ways of doing things in Chinatown, and that transferring Dr. Johnson out of Chinatown was tantamount to throwing away her years of experience with the community.


""She has been involved and active with the community for many years,"" said Chinese Hospital Administrator Daniel Richardi. ""Health Center #4 under her direction has had a tremendous impact on health programs throughout Chinatown.""


""She was one of those involved from the very beginning to get a nursing home for the Chinatown area, which resulted in the incorporation of On Lok, and she was one of the early supporters for NEMS, Family Planning and for the new wing of Chinese Hospital in her work behind the scenes,"" said Dr. William Gee, board president of On Lok Senior Services.


""Dr. Johnson has used her position as District Health Officer to promote innovations in health care programs,"" Dr. Gee continued. ""It's a tremendous mistake to transfer her out of Health District #4. The community will suffer a loss that will be hard to recover from. If she is allowed to stay, we can expect more and better things to come of it.""

SAN FRANCISCO--Firecrackers heralded the appearance of Sala Burton, wife of the late Congressman Phil Burton, when she had lunch with members of the Asian community on Tuesday, April 26.


While lions pranced to the beat of the drums, Burton greeted friends and was warmly escorted to the Grand Palace Restaurant on Grant Ave. She is no stranger to the Asian community, and is known as a political force in her own right. She is currently seeking election to the Fifth Congressional District seat vacated by her husband when he died on April 10.


With less than two months away to the special election on June 21, Burton is busy reassuring the various communities of her commitment to their needs, just as her husband had been. She was dressed smartly in a brown suit as she shook hands confidently with members of the Chinese, Japanese and Filipino community.


""A few weeks ago, I had no idea that I would be standing here in lieu of my husband,"" Burton began. Her introductory words drew the full attention of the more than 250 people who were gathered at the luncheon. ""Phil was a champion of the rights of the Asian people ... There will be no question that I will support all the issues that you were interested in.""


Having recently returned from Washington, D.C. where she met with various political leaders, Burton said that she has been endorsed by ""the entire California Democratic Committee, the second most important person in the country, the Speaker of the House, and all the congresswomen. But nothing is as touching and important as the people who have come to show their support for me today.


""... I will always be there for you ... to make this community part and parcel of the nation,"" she added.


Burton also voiced her appreciation to the Asian community for being the first to hold a fundraiser for her campaign.


Dr. Dale King, president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, praised Burton as a ""capable, talented and very resourceful"" woman, as did William Lee, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, and Ben Hom, chairman and president of United Bank. Former postmaster Lim P. Lee emceed the event.


""Sala Burton helped mold the philosophy that helped the Asian community ... to obtain redress and other matters,"" noted James Arima, vice president of the Japanese American Democratic Club.


""In life, love begets love and Phil Burton loved the Filipino community,"" declared Alex Esclamado, publisher of the Philippine News. ""The least we can do for him is to pledge our support for Sala ... it be hooves us to see to it that she will be there carrying the torch for us.""


Others who were present at the noon gathering included Joe Quan. Harry Tam of the United Acupuncturists of America, June Sugihara of California First Bank, and Doris Thomas and James Fang from the office of the fifth congressional district.

SAN FRANCISCO--Asians constitute approximately 64 percent of the student population at Lowell High School, a San Francisco public school named by Money magazine as one of the ""12 top public high schools"" in the nation.


According to the Data Processing Department of the San Francisco Unified School District, 2,898 pupils presently attend Lowell, which is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and is a permanent member of the College Board. Of this number, 1,842 are Asians and Pacific Islanders.


Chinese students make up a 44.2 percent plurality of the student population with a total count of 1,281, despite the fact that Chinese represent only 19 percent of The City's total population. With 237 in attendance, Filipinos represent 8.2 percent of the students while the Japanese and Koreans represent 4 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Presently, 119 Japanese attend Lowell, while 66 of the pupils are Korean.


""Other non-white"" students, a category which includes ethnic groups such as Samoans, Vietnamese and Pacific Islanders, constitute 4 percent of the school population with a 139 total.


In terms of class levels, Asians make up 59.8 percent of the freshmen, 62.4 percent of the sophomores and 65.4 percent of the juniors. Lowell's senior class includes approximately 511 Asian students, or 67 percent of the total seniors.


The statistics report did not include an ethnic breakdown according to sex, but there are generally more females than males in each of the class levels. Females, with a total count of 1,687 make up 58.2 percent of the total student population, while the 1,211 males account for 418 percent.


Although Asians currently represent Lowell's majority, such was not always the case.


""Before 1965,"" Lowell Assistant Principal George, Hsu explained, ""the Immigration laws were so strict that many Asians were not allowed into San Francisco."" Consequently, there were (relatively) few Asians in The City itself much less at Lowell After 1965 however, immigration laws were less severe and more Asians entered both The City and the school.


""This just goes to prove,"" Hsu stated, ""that as long as Asians are provided with opportunities, they don't hesitate to make the best out of those opportunities.""


The first public high school built west of the Mississippi River, Lowell was founded in 1856. It was named after James Russell Lowell, a Cambridge Brahmin who became a distinguished poet and editor of the Atlantic Monthly. In 1962, after moving three times in over 100 years, the school took up its fourth and present location at 1101 Eucalyptus Drive, near San Francisco State University and across the street from Lake Merced.


Lowell is a four-year, all-academic urban school where admission is competitive and selective. ""Applicants have increased,"" Hsu said, ""but only one out of every four applicants got in this Fall semester."" According to Hsu, admission depends on space availability as well as several academic requirements.


The school bases ninth grade admission on seventh and eighth grade academic marks combined with the results of a comprehensive test. The previous year's marks determine 10th through 12th grade admission. Grades received in both public and private schools are equally weighted and there are no admission restrictions according to sex or race.


Each student must take at least four academic subjects per semester. According to a Lowell profile report for 1982-83, the overall grade point average of the Spring 1982 semester was 2.857 (A=4.000).


The school offers Advanced Placement (A.P.) courses in all subjects except Art History, French and Spanish Literature, and Music Listening. Honors classes are offered in English, French, Spanish, mathematics and chemistry.


Lowell's 1982 A.P. examination program was among the largest in the nation. Of the 273 Lowell students who took a total of 399 A.P. tests, 91 percent achieved a passing score. The average Lowell score was 3.8. The national average was 3.1.


Of the June 1982 class, 95 percent of the graduates went on to college immediately. Of this figure, 36 percent attend the University of California, 22 percent attend a California State University, 27 percent attend City College of San Francisco, and 10 percent attend other colleges.


Furthermore, Lowell seniors who take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (S.A.T.) consistently average above 1000 in their combined verbal and mathematics scores.


Notable Lowell alumni include governor Edmund G. Brown, Sr.; actress Carol Channing and financier Harold Zellerbach. America's first winner of the Nobel Prize, physicist Albert Abraham Michelson who won the prize for his research on the velocity of light, was also a Lowell graduate. In addition, several other public officials, jurists, sports stars and journalists attended the high school.

Three weeks prior to the Christmas recess of Asian Week I started this series on National Politics and Immigration. This is the concluding article because the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration bill failed in the lame duck session of the 97th Congress. It will be discussed later if the bill goes through the circuitous route of the new 98th Congress.


President Kennedy Initiated Immigration reforms in July 1963. (Asian Week, 9/18/80 and 12/23/82) Unfortunately, because of his assassination, he never saw his reform bill pass the Congress. President Johnson took the leadership for Immigration reform in January 1965. If it were not for the parliamentary skills of President Johnson, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 would not be law today. From the time of the proposal by President Kennedy in July 1963 to the final approval on September 23, 1965, by President Johnson, there was a wide range of events.


Immigration legislation like the 1965 Immigration Act required a great deal of support from many organizations and individuals of natural stature, including President Kennedy and President Johnson. 1963 was also a big year for the Civil Rights Movement. As Mike Feldman, President Kennedy's Special Assistant remarked, Civil Rights and Immigration Reform were part and parcel of the same package. John F. Kennedy proposed and Lyndon B. Johnson disposed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Immigration Act in 1965.


As early as 1958 J.F.K. wrote ""A Nation of Immigrants,"" and in 1963 as President, he was able to do something about it. In a-special message to Congress on 7-23-63, he said:


""The most urgent and fundamental reform I am recommending relates to the national origins system of selecting immigrants. Since 1924 it has been used to determine the number of quota immigrants permitted to enter the United States each year. Accordingly, although the legislation I am transmitting deals with many problems which require remedial action, it concentrates attention primarily upon revision of our quota immigration system. The enactment of this legislation will not resolve all of our important problems in the field of immigration law. It will, however, provide a sound basis upon which we can build in developing an immigration law that serves the national interest and reflects in every detail the principles of equality and human dignity to which our Nation subscribes.""


President Johnson in January 1964 said:


""This bill applies new tests and new standards which we believe are reasonable and fair and right. I refer specifically to: What is the training and qualification of the immigrant who seeks admission? What kind of a citizen would he make, if he were admitted? What is his relationship to persons in the United State? And what is the time of his application? These are rules that are full of common sense, common decency, which operate for the common good.


""That is why in my state of the Union message last Wednesday, January 8, 1964, I said that I hoped that in establishing preferences a nation that was really built by immigrants--immigrants from all lands--could ask those who seek to immigrate now: What can you do for our country? But we ought never to ask: In what country were you born?""


Congressional Record


88th Congress, Second Session


Vol. X # 136


Attorney General Nicholas de B Katzenback of President Johnson's cabinet delivered an address on. Immigration before the Cultural Heritage Dinner in San Francisco on 4-3-65, stating:


""The national origins system harms the U.S. in still another way: it creates an image of hypocrisy which can be exploited by those who seek to discredit our professions of democracy.


""Perhaps the single most discriminatory aspect of existing law is the so-called Asian Pacific Triangle provision. This clause requires persons of Asian stock to be assigned to quota areas not by place of birth but according to their racial ancestry. It is a depressing remnant of the Chinese exclusion laws which were finally abolished twenty years ago when Congress established a Chinese quota.""


Prior to the adoption of the 1965 Immigration Act, China had a quota of 205, Japan 185, and the Philippines 100. The 1952 law set quotas outside of the Western Hemisphere on the basis of the 1920 population. In 1964 quotas were about 158,000. More than half consisted of quotas for England and Ireland in which only 33,000 came to the U.S. Thus in FY 1964 only 102,000 persons entered under the quota system. Another 144,000 came from the Western Hemisphere. The rest were non-quota immigrants of spouses and minor children.


The 1965 Act redistributed the quotas for Canada and Latin America of 120,000 and the rest of the world 170,000 annually. China got approximately 20,000 annual quota, and in 1982 Taiwan, Republic of China, also received 20,000 quota.


Quotas are given to countries on a first come, first served basis to persons in the following categories:


(1) Unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, 20 percent;


(2) Spouses and unmarried sons and daughters of lawful alien residents, 20 percent;


(3) Members of the professions, arts and sciences, 10 percent;


(4) Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, 10 percent;


(5) Brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, 24 percent;


(6) Needed skilled and unskilled workers, 10 percent;


(7) Refugees from communism, the Middle East and natural calamity, 6 percent.


Four American Presidents--Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson--recommended that Congress abolish the national origins quota system. Congress did in 1965. The Simpson-Mazzoli bill is the first tinkering of that system. Let's see what happens in the 98th Congress. Asian Week will keep you informed.

TOKYO -- Hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the banks of the Sumida River one recent summer evening to watch bursts of red, white, blue yellow and purple colors flood the night sky.


For more than hour, 17,500 ""powderballs"" were launched into the air, at a cost of $540,000. The Sumida River Fireworks Festival is one of hundreds of Japanese pyrotechnic shows that take place throughout the summer. This year the festival marked what was billed as its 250th anniversary, reports AP.


Although the pyrotechnic display has been held on an irregular basis since 1868, scholars have traced the origins of the festival to 1733. That's when the shogunate, or feudal government, blasted fireworks over the river in a religious ceremony to soothe the ""vengeful spirits"" of people who died in a cholera epidemic the year before.


Ever since fireworks were first introduced by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, they have been a popular amusement for the Japanese. In present-day Japan more than 200 companies compete in the $30-million-a-year industry, noted Shoichi Minemura of the Japan Fireworks Association. About 10 percent of the products are exported.


Kyosuke Ogatsu, whose centuries-old family gunpowder business turned exclusively to fireworks in 1864, claimed that Japanese fireworks are better than those made in the U.S. and Europe.


For one thing, Ogatsu pointed out, Japanese use spherical rather than cylindrical shells and can unfold into elaborate circular images while changing colors. But he also added that the European models often have more brilliant colors because of the availability of materials that produce bette grades . . . gunpowder.


Ogatsu's company, Maruta maya, won the first prize in a recent contest held in conjunction with the Sumida Festival. The 15-shot series, in which seven other companies participated, was titled, ""The Tradition of Light and flowers falling over the Sumida River.""


""Hanabi,"" the Japanese word for fireworks, literally translates to ""fire flowers.""


Unlike Marutamaya, most fireworks companies also produce gunpowder products, usually for military use. Hosoya Kasei is another fireworks firm in Tokyo which is under contract to the Japan Defense Agency and makes explosives, smoke bombs and flares. Fireworks account for about 30 percent of the 70-year-old company's $7 million in annual sales.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Citing the tennis star's ""bad behavior at Wimbledon,"" Chinese for Affirmative Action barred John McEnroe from participating in CAA's 1983 Fundraising Tennis Tournament, to be held Saturday, Sept. 10 at the Chabot Canyon Raquet Club in Oakland.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The board of directors of the Hoy San Ning Yung Association voted unanimously last week to have its building committee start studies of the proposed condo tower at 814-828 Stockton St., ending speculation that the association might back out of the costly project.


Harrison Lim, president of the association, said the board adopted the attitude that the lengthy list of conditions placed on the development actually provide an excellent opportunity for the . . . carry on its tradition of service to the community.


The S.F. Planning commission stipulated that before building the condo tower, the association must provide funds for improved maintenance and clean-up at Portsmouth Square, adult supervision for children playing after school and during weekends and vacations at Commodore Stockton School, assistance to the garment factories being displaced from the site of the building and must provide assistance in acquring space for a new park in Chinatown.


Lim pointed out that Portsmouth Square could give Chinatown a bad image if maintenance is not improved. Also, supervision for children would be a boon to the many families in which both parents are working during the day, as well as provide an opportunity for educational programs to heighten the children's awareness of Chinese culture.


Lim pointed out that if Ning Yung takes the Planning Commission's conditions seriously and endeavors to meet those conditions, The City must also live up to its end of the bargain and seriously attempt to acquire space for a new park in Chinatown. That too would be excellent for the community, he said.


""Whatever is good for the community is good the the Ning Yung Association,"" he said.

SAN FRANCISCO--He started business on Grant Avenue in Chinatown in 1936, and has served the neighborhood ever since. But when his rent skyrocketed from $726 to $3,000 per month, Dr. Arthur Chong decided it was time to throw in the towel.


Chong an optometrist, has done business in the cramped, eight-feet-wide office at 752 Grant Avenue since 1942, when he took it over from the American Steamship line for a monthly rent of $75. He had originally started business six years earlier in an herb doctor's shop next door and was the only Chinese optometrist in the area.


He has watched Chinatown go from a residential neighborhood to an attraction for tourists, ""especially since the U.S. opened up to imports from mainland China,"" he noted.


And now the shop he runs with his son, Dr. Richard Chong, will itself become a business catering to tourists.


A new jewelry shop will be moving into the space at 752 Grant. The 700 block of Grant Avenue already has no less than 15 shops dealing in jewelry and art goods, as well as one clothing shop, one bank and four restaurants.


Chong noted that a shop on one side of his office sells jade while one to the other side sells other types of jewelry; and speculated that the new business moving in might be able to specialize in yet another type of gem or material in order to carve out its own niche. ""But what are they going to have to charge for it to be able to make the rent?"" he wondered.


The younger Chong will open shop at 1833 Powell Street, between Greenwich and Filbert in North Beach. The two optometrists have sent notices to 5,000 of their regular customers to alert them to the move, and hope the new location will not cause any inconvenience. ""The new office is just a short bus ride away.""

Hey, hey Marcos, smile while you can.


Remember what happened to the Shah of Iran.""


That has been the recurring chant of protesters outside the Conculate of the Philippines in San Francisco during the past several weeks, since the assassination of Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino. And many fear the similarities between the cases of the Shah and President Ferdinand Marcos could have drastic consequences for the United States.


Steve Psinakis, one of the leaders of the opposition in the U.S. to Marcos was outside the consulate during the demonstration on Wednesday, Sept. 21, collecting signatures on petitions requesting that President Ronald Reagan postpone his planned trip to Manila at least until after Marcos has been absolved of any involvement in the assassination, by an impartial international investigation.


""The question -- is whether Marcos would allow such an investigation,"" Psinakis said in an interview. ""He should have been the first to jump at the chance to have an impartial investigation clear him of any complicity. His appointment of a pro-government commission to investigate the government only enhances the suspicion that he was involved in the conspiracy.""


On the comparison to the situation in Iran in 1979, Psinakis said the anti-American sentiments fostered by the conquest at the turn of the century, the bias against Filipino immigrant laborers prior to 1934 and the lack of aid to the Philippines after World War II, had for the most part faded in recent years.


""But these recent events have resurrected some of those sentiments. The U.S. is no longer seen as a colonial imperialist, but my contacts in the Philippines tell me a strong sentiment against American neocolonialism is growing among the people.


""When the American Embassy in Tehran was taken, the TV cameras showed us the faces of these apparently insane animals who had seized the complex and taken our people hostage. Yes, they looked insane. But what the cameras didn't show us was the years of abuses which had built up the intense hatred that the people of Iran felt toward the Shah, and therefore toward the U.S. which supported him.


""The same thing is happening in the Philippines."" Psinakis claimed. ""People's wives or sisters are raped, a man is arrested in the dark of night and put in all indefinitely without ever being charged of any crime, people are beaten and tortured. And the U.S. is increasingly seen as the power which allows Marcos to do this.""


Of Marcos' claim that he would be able to provide security for President Reagan during his planned visit to Manila in November Psinakis scoffed, ""It is almost an admission of guilt. If he is capable of providing security for Reagan, then that means he deliberately did not provide security for Aquino. If he says he did provide security for Aquino... Three unarmed guards -- what were they supposed to do if an assassin showed up, box with him?


""We have heard that there have been threats. I am convinced that President Reagan's life would be in danger if he went to the Philippines at this time.""


Psinakis also disputed the government claim that it did not know which flight Aquino would be on when he arrived at Manila International Airport on Aug. 21. ""That is a lie. We know now that an intelligence colonel walked up to Ninoy at the airport in Taipei and said. 'Have a good trip, Senator.' And contrary to the public statements of Marcos, no other planes were surrounded or searched that day.""


Psinakis said he has spent ""endless hours"" studying all available material on Aquino's assassination, and has consulted with a former police inspector whose conclusion was that ""there had to be a conspiracy.""


""All the available eveidence so far indicates that (General Fabian) Ver was the principal executor of the plan, and Ver is known to be the one man in the Philippines who would never do anything contrary to the wishes of Marcos and, more importantly, without his okay and approval.


""It was Ver whose men were assigned to the airport. And it was he who announced before Ninoy's arrival that there was an assassination plot that would take place at the airport. And it was he who at least totally neglected to provide security and thus allowed the assassination to take place.


""You tie Ver to the plot and you definitely tie Marcos,"" Psinakis charged.


""I am aware of at least eight credible witnesses who confirm that a soldier shot Aquino from the steps (of the plane),"" Psinakis said. ""So it is my conviction, not a theory, that Marcos gave the word to go ahead (with the assassination.""


Psinakis was suspicious of the recent violence at demonstrations in the Philippines.


""I don't believe the bombings and violence are the work of either the moderate opposition or the communists. The opposition has nothing to gain by such attacks. They have the upper hand at this time, picking up momentum every day. Why would they engage in such cruel acts?


""It is possible that Marcos had some of his goons infiltrate the demonstrations to foment violence and create an atmosphere conducive to a new government crackdown. He did this in 1972 -- this is established, it is known -- just before the imposition of martial law in 1972. The demonstrations by students were infiltrated by goons of Marcos, secret police people who threw bombs, killed a few people, engaged in such terrorist activities in order to give the impression that some sort of discipline was necessary. This was part of the excuse Marcos used to impose martial law.""


Psinakis admitted, though that he has no evidence indicating that any government agents had created the violence at recent demonstrations in the Philippines.


On the question of a peaceful transition of power following either the resignation, death or incapacitation of President Marcos Psinakis said much will depend on the actions of the Reagan administration.


""If the U.S. sends a signal to Marcos, as well as to the Filipino people, that Marcos should heed the wishes of the masses and should step down for peaceful elections, there is a good chance there would be a peaceful transition. If, on the other hand, Reagan were to embrace Marcos and give him total U.S. backing, the chances for a peaceful change in government would be hurt very much.""


Psinakis laughed at the government's position that dissidents are free to express opinions against Marcos without fear of retaliation.


""Since 1974, when I tried to expose the government's blackmail of my wife's own family. I have received hundreds of threats. I have received offers of bribes from Imelda Marcos herself. They have harassed and intimidated many Filipinos here through their agents.""


One Filipino businessman in San Francisco who asked not to be identified, told Asian Week that several years ago when he ran an advertisement in the Philippine News, an opposition paper, he was told by an official of the Philippine government to remove his ad from the paper. He did stop advertising in the paper, but has recently resumed.


Psinakis, said that at about 5:30 on the morning of Oct. 15, 1979, he was driving to his restaurant in the Financial District of San Francisco when two men pulled their car up close to his at a traffic signal. After signalling Psinakis to roll down his window to answer a question, one of the men drew a pistol equipped with a silencer and placed it against Psinakis' temple, saying, ""This is your last warning."" The men then drove away, Psinakis said.


Psinakis said the recent events in the Philippines have unified the Filipinos in the U.S. and erased much of their fear at speaking out. And he said they have become a more visible force in American politics, as evidenced by the California Legislature's recent approval of a resolution calling on Reagan to cancel his visit to the Philippines.


""I see unity coming out of this issue, which overrides differences on other issues."" He said that unity was sensed by California legislators when they quickly passed the resolution against Reagan's visit. ""The Filipinos can become a powerful voting bloc,"" he said.

One-armed bandits pay off big


The bells were ringing loudly for two lucky jackpot winners last week. An Ton Vuong, a 29-year-old San Francisco resident, won $180,927 at the MGM Grand Hotel in Reno after putting in only $3 in coins at a dollar slot machine.


After his big win, Vuong told reporters that he was ""shocked and couldn't believe it--now I can buy a home and take care of my family."" Vuong and his family are natives of Cholon, Vietnam, and have been in the U.S. since 1979. Back home they were candlestick merchants but have been living on federal aid since coming here.


The other big winner was Kam Chin Lee, a 64-year-old dishwasher at a Stockton restaurant who won $250,000 at Harrah's in South Lake Tahoe. Lee, who earns about $125 a week at the Chinese restaurant, hit the jackpot after playing $15 in quarters, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.


The elated restaurant worker said he wants to use his winnings to bring his family to the U.S. He has not seen them in 32 years. Lee left Canton in 1951, ""when it was easy to get out,"" and went to Cuba, where he stayed until 1980. He worked in the sugar cane fields and sent most of his income to his family.


Before coming to the U.S., he lived in Spain for six months, he He had always hoped ""to make enough money someplace to reunite his family in a more prosperous country.""


Community involvement


Serena Chen, producer and host of ""Asians Now!"" has been awarded the Marcus A. Foster Educational Institute's Distinguished Alumni Award. She was one of five former Oakland students chosen to receive the award, which is given annually to recognize the community work of alumni of the city's schools.


As a senior at Oakland Technical High School she helped organize the Associated Students of Oakland, a largely Third World group that was formed to express student concerns such as ethnic studies and bilingual counseling.


Her activity in the school community led her to active involvement in the Asian community.


""'Asians Now!' is a way of showing what Asians are doing,"" Chen added. ""We have more than 30,000 viewers every week, even some from southern Oregon, Eureka and San Luis Obispo. There are some non-Asian viewers and also Southeast Asian refugees who write us letters. This is probably one of the few programs that they can identify with, that validates their existence.


""If I didn't feel the need to do community work, I'd feel like a part of me didn't exist. Community work helps you to look beyond yourself, to stretch beyond your own limitations to help others.


""There are so many needs in the Asian community, it seems like a big waste if we don't help out.""


A BIG surprise


At 6-foot-7, Chen Kai was quite a ""big surprise for Americans,"" when he first visited the U.S. five years ago while playing basketball for the Chinese National Team. Now a student at Santa Monica College, he resides in the area with his wife Susan, who is a business lawyer.


Even at this height, Kai was only the fifth tallest member of his Chinese team. ""I had a teammate who was 7-foot-5 and weighed more than 400 pounds,"" he told Randy Krauch of Corsair, the campus newspaper.


He explained that natives of northern China are usually taller than those from the south. Most of the Chinese in the U.S. are from the southern region.


Twenty nine-year-old Kai has played basketball for more than 15 years. At the age of 17, he joined the Chinese Army for a ten-year stint. It was during this time that he became a member of the National Team, which was called ""August the First,"" named after ""the day the Chinese Army was established in 1927."" He usually played forward, averaging about 20 points per game.


Switching desks


Moving around in the business world:


Kiyoshi Mizuno, vice president of Sumitomo Bank of California and manager of the bank's office in Stockton will head the Geary Blvd, branch in San Francisco, replacing vice president Yuichi Higuchi, how transferred to San Mateo. The new manager of the downtown Sutter-Stockton office is vice president Toshio Yamada of the corporate banking unit.


Hidemasa Takizawa and Hank Abrahams are making it on their own. Takizawa, 47, was president and chief operating officer of Allied Canners and Packers, an international trading firm, while Abrahams was the chairman and chief executive officer there.


A veteran of the import-export business, Takizawa has been in the U.S. for 16 years. Now with Abrahams, he imports and exports goods under the Meto Corp. label. Their special imports are mandarin oranges from Japan, Taiwan and Korea, Japanese tuna, Chinese mushrooms and Thai pineapple. They export a lot of West Coast fruits and vegetables.


Worth 1,000 words


Gary Fong of the San Francisco Chronicle was named ""Photographer of the Year"" at the recent California Press Photographers Association awards ceremony. This is the second time that he has received the award.


Through the years Fong has received numerous awards for his work, and does not regret his switch from engineering to photojournalism in college.


""You have to be in love with photography,"" he said in an interview last year. ""The extra dedication it takes--you don't consider it a sacrifice of your personal time if it's really an overgrown hobby. Socially, you don't feel you're giving up anything, if you really enjoy what you're doing.""


New womanager


Leslie Quan Hudson of Santa Rosa has been promoted to manager of special projects at the TransAmerica Title Insurance Company. She handles the company's Sonoma County operations such as the Santa Rosa Square and Waterfall Towers transactions. A native of Santa Rosa, Hudson joined TransAmerica Title in 1976 after working in the real estate field for 11 years.


Haven for investors


Just as the Canadians eagerly sought U.S. property in the 1970s, Mimi Kuo Cary believes that the ""next wave"" of American real estate are the Hong Kong investors.


In a report in USA Today she predicted that Hong Kong investors will hold ""10 to 12 percent of the major metropolitan developmental and commercial real estate, about the same market penetration Canadian buyers' had in the 1970s.""


What has created the rush to buy land in the U.S. is the uncertainty about the colony's future after 1997, the year Britain's lease on Hong Kong expires and the colony returns to Chinese administration. This ""causes people to rechannel their money into a more politically stable situation. The safest haven is the U.S.,"" Cary said.


Cary, 35, was born in Hong Kong. A graduate of Radcliffe College, she joined the Oakland-based firm of Grubb & Ellis a year ago after several years in the real estate field. She is currently co-vice president of the company's international investment division and is trying to get buyers from the Pacific region, such as Japan, Malaysia. Indonesia and Hong Kong, to buy American.

SAN FRANCISCO -- ""Coining"" is a common practice in Southeast Asia. A coin is rubbed over the body of a sick person to drive out the ""bad wind"" that afflicts him. In the process bruise-like marks are often left behind; when Western doctors and nurses see such marks on a child, they are likely to believe it is evidence of child abuse.


Such confusion frequently occurs when Western, medicine meets Eastern customs and practices, and in at least one Southern California case it resulted in the suicide of an Asian refugee unjustly accused of child abuse, according to Ron Rowell of the S.F. Refugee Health Agency. ""We try to make sure that never happens here,"" he said.


Rowell believes the misunder-standings that arise from ""coining"" are but one example of the difficulties encountered by persons with little or no English in obtaining health care. The quality of such care is an important concern in San Francisco, where an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 refugees -- most of them Asians -- have settled. When the well established Asian and Hispanic communities are taken into account, the possibility exists that a large segment of the local population may not be getting adequate health care because of cultural or language problems.


Some other examples:


""(Refugees) don't like to give blood because they don't believe it will be replaced. No one has ever explained it to them,"" . . . said.


Many . . . take smaller doses of prescribed medications than they should because they are physically smaller than Caucasians. ""They think the medicine is for bigger people,"" Rowell said, ""so they cut back on it.""


A Vietnamese woman who needed a hysterectomy initially refused to have one because she misunderstood what the surgery involved, according to Patricia Tanquary, an assistant administrator at French Hospital. The woman believed that the surgery would leave her unable to have sex and that she would no longer please her husband. After an interpreter explained the procedure to her in her own language, she agreed to go ahead with the surgery.


Hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities which provide around-the-clock health care are legally obligated to assist patients with language problems. Federal regulations require that all such facilities which receive federal funds provide equality of care to all of their patients.


Gov. George Deukmejian last September signed into law AB 885, which specifically states that hospitals must furnish medically trained interpreters for all languages spoken by more than five percent of the population in the surrounding area.


But writing a regulation or passing a law does not necessarily mean a problem is solved. What are local hospitals, community groups and governmental agencies doing to help break the language barrier? What more could be done? What if you are sick and don't speak English?


Bouakham Phenepasany has been a medical-interpreter for the past three years, first for the U.S. Public Health Service refugee program, then for S.F. General Hospital. She is one of 15 full-time paid interpreters employed by the hospital to assist patients in Spanish, Chinese and several Indo-Chinese languages. She speaks three Chinese dialects Laotian and Thai. One morning she was on her way to interpret for three young Vietnamese refugees who needed eye examinations.


Just speaking the right language isn't always enough when trying to explain modern medical practices to persons who may have no experience with them, Phenepasany said.


""Sometimes I use hand signals or make funny faces to make them understand,"" she said. But since she herself came to the U.S. only five years ago, she can sympathize with the patients' problems. ""When you first arrive (in this country) you feel lonely and sad because nobody understands. I feel happy helping people.""


The people she would help that day were two brothers, 15 and 16, and a sister, 12, who were referred by General's Refugee Screening Clinic to Dr. Al Shiba, an optometrist. They arrived two months, ago with their mother, father, grandmother and three other children. Dr. Shiba began with the little girl.


""Can she read the (English) alphabet?"" he asked. It happened that she could if she couldn't, Dr. Shiba would have had to use another eye chart designed for children too young to read.


""Sometimes it's hard for them to understand the concept of what we are trying to do."" Dr. Shiba said. ""I can usually determine -- if they need glasses -- what the prescription should be. But the exact level of vision is sometimes hard to determine.""


The examin . . . revealed that all three children had similar eye problems and will probably need glasses to correct them. Dr. Shiba asked if any of the children have worn glasses before. The 15-year-old said he once wore glasses but left them in Vietnam.


Dr. Shiba feels that the presence of an interpreter is an important advantage in treating patients with . . . problems. It is sometimes possible for a doctor to diagnose and treat a person without speaking that persons' language, but it is just as important to let the patient know the results of an examination and the course of treatment to be followed. For that, an interpreter is invaluable, he said.


Bilingual employees


The staff at S.F. General provided such assistance 1800 times in September, according to Ray Rivera, General's bilingual services officer. He said General takes a two-stage approach to solving language problems. The first stage was to hire a staff of paid interpreters who are on duty from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. every day. The second stage has been to recruit bilingual employees for key positions in the hospital. He identified such positions as nursing, admitting and social work as being especially important.


Rivera said that an April 1983 survey of the hospital's 1,300 employees indicated there are 255 civil service and approximately 100 non-civil, service employees who speak a second language.


General's program began about five years ago when the hospital was approached by several community groups concerned with health services for non-English-speaking persons. The current program is the result of an agreement between the hospital and these groups.


Rivera claimed significant progress has been made toward equality of service since the agreement was reached.


""The situation has improved a lot,"" he said, ""but it has not reached the point where it meets the spirit of the agreement."" He welcomes input from interested groups and individuals on how the service can be improved.


""I was born in Cuba. My mother and father spoke Chinese and I picked up Spanish on my own,"" said Connie Hom. She is a housekeeping aide and volunteer interpreter at Kaiser Hospital in San Francisco Because she speaks both Spanish and Cantonese, she has been frequently called upon to interpret for patients in her three years with Kaiser.


Hom enjoys interpreting.


""I love the Lord; I'm a Christian. I believe we should help people in difficulty,"" she said. Her duty station is in the operating room, so she has occasionally been asked to interpret during surgery. ""Usually, the doctors just ask if it hurts.""


The most difficult aspect of interpreting is being asked to be the bearer of bad news, Hom said. She was once asked to tell a woman her child had died.


""It was very said,"" she lamented. And because interpreting takes her away from her job, she can't always spend as much time with the patient as she would like. But many persons are grateful for her help and ask for her by name, she added.


Kaisers' volunteer interpreter program began about three years ago, once again after an agreement with local community groups. In the first quarter of 1983, 89 Kaiser employees were called upon to interpret 860 times in 14 languages.


""The volunteer approach has been very successful,"" asserted Dan Danzig, Kaiser's public affairs representative. ""It is not popular with our employees. They feel it enhances their job.""


Since S.F. General and Kaiser are two of the busiest hospitals in The City, it should be no surprise that their interpreter programs are also the most intensively used. But all of the hospitals contacted here have made at least some provision for helping patients with language problems.


UCSF Hospital has a list of 150 volunteers who can interpret for more than 50 languages and dialects. The hospital also works with S.F. General, the Refugee Health Agency and other outside sources to help ensure their patients get the service they need.


French Hospital has also developed some resource materials to aid in overcoming the language barrier. These include admission packages and menus in Chinese Spanish, French and Russian and illustrated pamphlets with common patient requests in the patient rooms. A drawing of a glass of water above a printed request for water both in English and the patients' language can usually get the message across without the need for an interpreter.


Telephone service


But all of these programs assume the patient is in the hospital or at least prepared to wait on the telephone until an interpreter can be located. What can persons with limited English skills do in an emergency?


The S.F. Police Communications Dept. maintains the emergency 911 line. According to Lt. Steve Driscoll, the watch commander several dispatchers are bilingual -- including ""three or four Chinese speaking individuals.""


Driscoll said the police would like to have more, but we have a very difficult time trying to recruit people who speak Oriental languages because English must be their primary language. They must handle all calls, not just calls from people who don't speak English.""


When a call comes in to 911, the calling number is immediately available to the dispatcher. By February the dispatcher will also have an automatic address locator, so the police will be able to respond even if they don't understand exactly what the problem is, said Capt. Michael Brush, head of the Communications Dept.


Brush believes the address locator will help with calls from persons with hearing and speech problems and children, as well as those with language problems.


""We would like to have the capability to handle calls in a half-dozen languages 24 hours a day,"" Brush said, ""but we can't promise that.""


Medical training


Rowell believes it is important for intrpreters in a medical setting to have medical training. He hopes A.B. 885 will ensure that competent interpreters are always available.


""I'll be interested to see what the future brings."" Rowell said. ""It will take time for (the new law) to be felt. I don't think that many hospitals are aware of it yet.""


Rowell sees the use of volunteer interpreters as an incomplete solution to language problems, because the employees in such programs often have no medical background -- no anatomy, physiology or medical terminology. Also, the employees are not being paid extra for the extra work involved.


""If hospitals can continue to do what they do now -- which is to draw up a list of employees who speak another language -- and say these are our interpreters, then nothing much has changed,"" Rowell charged.


His judgement may seem harsh in light of the efforts local hospitals are already making to meet the needs of their non-English speaking patients. But without the services of competent, accessible interpreters, is clear that true equality of service will remain an unrealized ideal.

DAVIS -- The preliminary hearing for the murder charges against James ""Jay"" Pierman, 17 accused of killing 17-year-old high school student Thong Hy Huynh, has been postponed until Dec. 8.


Huynh was stabbed to death on May 4 during a fight at Davis High School. (See Asian Week, 5/12/83.) Principal David Murphy of the school said there had been some racial taunting against Vietnamese students for several weeks before the incident.


According to David C. Henderson, assistant district attorney for Yolo County, the preliminary hearing was postponed because a new attorney from the Public Defender's office has been assigned to represent.


Pierman and needs time to study the case.


Pierman is being tried as an adult.


Henderson said that previous statements by counsel for Pierman indicates the defendant will not deny having held the knife that killed Huynh.


""Initially, Mr. Pierman claimed that it was a coincidence that he was holding the knife,"" said Henderson. ""He said he had retrieved it from his car to return it to its owner. He said the Vietnamese boy attacked him and fell on the knife.""


Henderson said the owner of the knife was Russell Clark, another student involved in the fight.


Pierman's hearing will be held Thursday, Dec. 8 at 9 a.m. in the Davis Municipal Court, 3rd and D Streets.


Henderson said if the hearing is completed on Dec. 8 and the judge finds just cause for prosecution, then Pierman will be ordered to face arraignment in Superior Court on or before Dec. 23.


Huynh's killing caused a wave of outrage and protest across the country, coming right on the heels of lenient sentences being given to the confessed killers of Vincent Chin in Detroit.


The same week Huynh was killed in Davis, Vietnamese widow Trac Thi Vu was shot by a sniper while she worked in the kitchen of her home in a Los Angeles suburb. Reports at the time said neighbors had been annoyed by the ""extended family"" living situation at the woman's house, with a number of working adults there and a large number of cars parked in the driveway.


The rising tide of violence against Asians has caused alarm nationwide. The Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission recently held an all-day hearing to explore the phenomenon and search for ways to stern the bigotry before it becomes widespread. (See Asian Week. 11/18/83.)

PULLMAN, Wash.--Most people think of American pioneers who civilized and cultivated the frontiers as those in covered wagons making their way westward across the Great Plains. Many, however, came from the opposite direction.


""Asian American Pioneers of Eastern Washington,"" a daylong symposium to be held at the Wapato Filipino Community Hall April 30 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., is devoted to showing how Japanese and Filipino immigrants made the eastward journey across the Pacific and settled in locales like the Yakima Valley.


""With panel discussions, a videotaped performance of a nationally broadcast drama set in Wapato, and talks by nationally and internationally noted cultural leaders, the symposium aims to enrrcn the . . . and participants' knowledge of these pioneers' histories, achievements, and the distinctly American cultures they have developed among other Americans of the region,"" said Gail Nomura, assistant professor of Asian American Studies at WSU and co-chairman of the symposium. The symposium is sponsored by the Washington State University Asian American Studies Program and the Department of Comparative American Cultures.


""Recognizing the need for learning about Asian and Pacific Americans to complete the picture of pioneering and settlement in Eastern Washington, the Washington Commission for the Humanities, a state-based program of the National Endowment for the Humanities, is helping to fund the symposium,"" Prof. Nomura said.


The symposium is free and open to the public, who are invited to attend any or all of the day's programs.


""It is especially important that community members of all the region's ethnic groups take part in the discussions with scholars and resource persons for the project,"" Nomura said. ""One major goal of the symposium is to incorporate the local Asian American community's history into the more broadly known history of this region. Community knowledge left unrecorded is being lost and forgotten.""


The day's programs feature speakers from the Yakima community and elsewhere in the state. These local resource persons include Kara Kondo and Roy Baldoz of Yakima; Gail Nomura, Stephen Sumida and Earl Smith of the Washington State University Department of Comparative American Cultures; Peter Bacho of the University of Washington Asian American Studies Program, and Dorothy Cordova of the Demonstration Project for Asian Americans, based in Seattle.


Wapato native Momoko Ito, a nationally noted playwright, will return to her birthplace from Los Angeles to show and discuss her play, ""The Gold Watch,"" about a Japanese American family in Wapato at the outbreak of World War II. Joining Iko in a discussion of Asian American literature and other cultural expressions of the region will be poet Alan Chong Lau, who now works and writes in Seattle.


Arriving from California State University at Hayward will be N.V.M. Gonzalez, one of the most distinguished writers of fiction among Filipino Americans. Internationally known and acclaimed for his work in literature, Prof. Gonzalez will speak about the deepseated feelings people have about immigration and the movement of peoples from far away to settle in places like the Yakima Valley.


For further information about the April 30 symposium contact Gail Nomura or Stephen Sumida at Washington State University, Pullman (509) 335-1966; or Roy Baldoz, Yakima, at (509) 877-4325.

TOKYO--Atari Inc. will begin sales of video game players and cartridges in Japan next month, according to an AP report.


The new Japanese subsidiary, Atari International Nippon, Inc., will start selling the players and 25 cartridges on May 10. The player will sell for 24,800 Japanese yen, or about $104, while the cartridges will range in price from $18 to $29.


""The big Japanese electronics companies view these video games as toys, and so the big boys have not been paying attention to this field. We may hit the jackpot (in Japan) or be a total flop,"" said Akira Euchi, manager of Atari International Nippon.


The popular Pac Man video game will not be sold in Japan because the game was designed in that country and Atari's license agreement does not allow for the sale of the game there. Euchi said that there is a possibility this may change as the agreement is being worked out.


Atari's market research has shown that Japanese mothers are especially education-conscious, so the company plans to sell educational video games later in the year, Karen Kenken of the marketing division noted.


Also to be put on the market is a keyboard which, together with the game console, television set and a cassette recorder, will function as a basic personal computer, she said.

Robert Lindsey, writing in the New York Times, 6/26/83:


For the past four years there has been a new wavn of immigrants from Southeast Asia, and they are changing the look, the economy, the culture and the texture of life in the Valley. In Merced County alone there are more than 7,000 Indochinese refugees in a population of 146,000. According to County Supervisor Ann Klinger, ""refugee issues totally permeate every other issue.""


Officials in many part of California are complaining with increasing sharpness that refugees are causing a serious strain on local welfare budgets, schools and medical facilities. The complaints have been particularly vocal here in the San Joaquin Valley, which suffers from chronic high unemployment and other economic difficulties despite its fertile soil and fame as a farming center.


In Merced County, where the unemployment rate is 16.9 percent, and the schools will go on double sessions in September because of the refugee influx, tensions are growing particularly bitter between immigrants and local residents. Competition is increasing between Asian and Hispanic Immigrants, a conflict that has been mirrored in demand for housing and jobs in urban areas of California. Almost all of Merced County's 7,000 Asian refugees are receiving county welfare checks because they have exhausted their 36 months of Federal relocation assistance, according to Barbara Johnson, the county's refugee services coordinator, and the number is growing.


""They come here because of the climate,"" she said, ""which is the kind they're used to, and because we have agriculture, which is also something they're used to although they find out our agriculture is different than what they were used to."" For their part, the new immigrants say they merely want help to learn English and learn a skill with which they can earn a living. At a public hearing in Fresno recently on the growing expense of supporting the refugees, Dag Hoa, a Hmong from the highlands of Laos who now lives here, said: ""Our goal is self sufficiency, but we ask ourselves, 'How?'""


The Hmongs were admitted to the U.S. by President Carter and President Reagan in recognition of their contributions during the Vietnam. War on the side of the Americans. They fought Pathet Zao, the Communist ruler of Laos, rescued American pilots downed by North Vietnam and . . . rilla warfare until driven into . . . refugee camps. An estimate by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in September of last year put their number at 53,300. They were originally scattered in Minnesota, Rhode Island. Oregon, Washington and Southern California. Finding Central California more to their liking, 20,000 flocked to California's San Joaquin Valley and are now relocated in Stockton, Fresno and Merced. The Hmongs as a group are more visible because of their unique characteristics and better feadership by their former military commanders in Laos.


""In the Valley's Merced County, Hmong have poured in in several waves. From April to June 1982, the Hmong population rose from 1,800 to 3,336, in November, the number was 5,000 and current estimates suggest 7,000.


""Unemployment ranged around 20 percent before refugees started to arrive in large numbers. Now it stands at 22.7 percent, with refugee unemployment at 92 percent, according to Diana Robertson of the State Employment Development Department Poor weather this year and the government payment-in-kind program have exacerbated the county's economic problems, she said.


""Schools in Merced County first noticed refugees 'trickling in' when they opened in September 1981. The influx became heavy by the end of the year and put a serious strain on the school system, according to Loren Peters, director of instructional services for the Merced City School District, where indochinese children, mostly Hmong, make up 13 percent of the school population.


""'But we've been able to cope,' said Peters, by leasing additional portable classrooms, and instituting programs to teach non-English-speaking children and to train teachers in second-language teaching methods. Peters praised the Hmong children's eagerness to learn and adapt their intelligence. 'We can't get them out of the classroom, even for recess,' he said. But he cited an obvious need for a new school building. The prospects for one look dim, however, because the state limits the amount of property tax (which provide the funds for new school construction) that can be collected.


""Because the county lacked experience in the national resettlement program, local officials were unsware until last fall that it could receive federal assistance for refugee social service. And only recently, after local officials voiced concerns to state officials and to the regional ORR office, was the county recognized as an impacted area and placed on the list of areas eligible for federal targeted assistance. The county may receive up to $1 million in federal funds for programs to help refugees find or retain employment and to overcome barriers to obtaining jobs.""


Refugee Reports, 5/20/83 American Council for Nationalities Services, Washington, D.C.


Next week I shall discuss the ""Availability of Funding for Targeted Assistance Grants for Services for Refugees in Local Areas of High Need"" made available through the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Social Security Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, which will help Merced, Fresno and San Joaquin counties in dealing with the S.E. Asian Refugees. I wish to acknowledge the assistance from Dr. Sharon M. Fujii, regional director, and Ms. Pauline K. Lee, senior program specialist, Office of Refugee Resettlement.

. . .


. . . Gorton Certamly there are places where our hand has been very very light and our guidance has been soft perhaps more by example than by chrection or by conditioning and on the change in certain policies in which there have been improvements. And I suppose there are several Latin American nations in which that is the ease. We seem to be faced now with an improving situation in a nation like Brazil for example which certainly the U.S. has encouraged. But it has not encouraged that by the use of some kind of heavy hand severe restrictions on trade or aid or anything else as a condition of our friendly relation ships with the nation. It has rather been simply to be supportive and at the same time to encourage any reasonable movement oward greater liberties and a greater degree of democracy.


And to that extent of course, that's exactly what we should encourage in the Philippines or, in any other place. But without any expectation that we're going to create magic solutions or that by simply saying, you will do it in thus and such fashion or you know we will take some kind of unpleasant steps . . . feel that we're going to have a sudden change not only in government but in the culture and other institutions which are a necessary prerequisite to certain forms of government.


Miller I don't believe that the United States should be involved in these countries at all whether that in fact would improve the situation or not if its own strategic interest aren't involved.


Now in virtually all of these countries we're talking about there seem to be strategic interests involved on the part of the United States or at least there are allegations of strategic implications. This is certainly the case in regard to the Philippines.


G. True


M. the Clark Air Force base and all that Given these strategic interests we are in fact involved in these countries we do have a lot of actual power over there to a large degree it's . . . power that is responsible for keeping some of these regimes in power.


G I think that's absolutely nonsensical, Jon I think you're misusing the word power to mean two different and antithetical things. We have power in the Philippines in the sense that we have both a naval base there and an air base there directed at our own external security and not of the Philippines. That should not be used to imply that we have or should exercise power over the internal activities of the Philippines. We have interests in the stability of the Philippine Republic at least as long as we are interested in having those bases but the fact that we have bases in that country does not give us power and should not give us power over the internal arrangements of the nation itself.


M I think it does whether we like it to or not I think that for instance Marcos is very much able to use the fact that the United States . . . to stay in power. It's quite . . . it the United States was not over there. . . . would be thrown . . .


. . . to remove ourselves from those bases we would be invited to remove ourselves from those bases (more quickly).


M. Let me read a statement by Rene Cruz, the National Chairperson of the Union of Democratic Filipinos, about the Marcos regime.


The regime enforces its rule through a so plustieated military apparatus.


. . .


G Where does that lead you?


M. In effect he is saying that the United States is responsible for keeping the Marcos government in power. Therefore it has tremendous leverage which it could use for good or evil or not use at all which perhaps seems to be the case.


G. If we were to withdraw all of the military and what in your view would happen in the Philippines?


M. According to this guy, and it's reasonable to me it would destabilize the situation and quite possibly Marcos would be thrown out of power.


G. And be succeeded by what?


M. It might go from bad to worse. I agree. But it the United States is not involved in a country in the first place then I don't think it is our responsibility. I don't think we have an obligation to improve the world. But it in fact we are involved. I think we do have an obligation to what happens there.


G. Well. I think that you'd better first then come up with a set of policies which don't permit you or other observers to . . . and . . . casually go over the . . . on that we might go from bad . . . It sounds . . . like you are . . .


Before we take . . . we ought to have some . . . what the . . . and consequences of that action would be don't you suppose?


M. Yes, I would agree, but the two things we're considering here are one keeping our bases and our forces there and using it as leverage to force reform on the Marcos regime; or, the alternative of pulling it out entirely and the consequences be damned.


G. You know you only have two choices. You're either going to say that if you do not take certain actions relating to your own internal arrangements and structure of government, we will withdraw any military, or for that matter economic aid which we are giving to the country, and we'll withdraw our military bases from the country. Now if that's a phony threat that's worse than doing nothing at all. It you don't really mean to do it you better not make the threat in the first place. It you do make that threat to the government of the Philippines, in my opinion the consequences will be the government of the Philippines will say very politely to us please remove your aircraft and your navy and keep your military aid to yourself, and we'll tax our citizens more and we'll buy that military aid from France.


While I can agree with the facts as to the dollar amounts of aid to the Philippine army in the last decade. I don't agree with the consequences in the article which you read. My firm opinion is that that aid is not necessary to the security of the present regime in the Philippines and that any effort on our part, to take a much stronger position towards its internal structures would simply result in their asking us to leave, and that if anything the net result would be a more repressive and not a less repressive Philippine regime. It's that premise on which I based my own statement about what our relationship with the Philippine government should be.


I believe that as long as we are taking that individual one that we should do everything of a positive nature we can to encourage greater liberties for the citizens of the Philippine Republic. I think we should do that by example. We do have something of a special relationship with she Philippines created by the history of the entire twentieth century. I do feel . . . strongly however in spite of the strong and . . . feelings of . . . exiles either forced . . . self-induced from the Philippines that a significantly harder line on the part of the United States would be counterproductive to the growth and progress of the Philippines and we'd probably end up with us with a much less secure relationship with that country and the Philippines, with not only less stability, but less freedom as well. And I think that we had better look very, very carefully at the instances, such as Iran, in which we have followed policies of that sort. Because it seems to me that it is far more likely than not that it would result in a worse situation than the one in which we originally took our steps designed to cure.


M. It's quite possible that I would agree with you in regard to your factual statements there factual allegations, if in fact that is the situation in the Philippines. But would you say that in principle, that if the United States could use its power in such a way in the Philippines, to improve the human rights situation there, without actually causing more harm or destruction than it prevents.


G. I would make a much broader statement than that. I would say that if in any place in the world we can increase both the security and the freedoms and the economic opportunities of a given group or nation of people, by our policies, direct or indirect, as long as they don't involve the use of force and violence against them, that we should do so. I wouldn't limit that to countries in which we have bases or with which we have alliances. It would include every nation of the world whether it's of strategic interest to us or not, whether it is presently, democratic, authoritarian, or communist or not. The whole direction of our foreign policy in addition to our own security would be to secure the benefits of liberty and progress to anyone whom with whom we can conveniently supply those magnificent American commodities.


M. Do you think that in the case of countries where we do have actual military involvement, bases, we do have actual power in the situation that if we could use our power in such a way that it would improve the human rights situation even though it might involve force and even violence, but let's say not against the people.


G. No I do not. No. I can't think of any thing more unpopular with the American people, or more wrong from a . . . of view of international relationships than to use our armed forces to impose governmental reforms or governmental changes--I wouldn't call them reforms. I rather doubt that they would be such--governmental changes on other sovereign nations of the world I think that's absolutely disasterous.


M. In other words you'd be against the use of our military power in the Philippines to get Marcos, let's say to open up his jails and release political prisoners.


G. Yes, that is absolutely accurate or for that matter in any other country.


I suppose since I've run to the end of my time, at least for this interview. I simply have to reiterate that I do not believe that we have a responsibility for the nature of the government of the Philippine Republic. The idea that somehow or other we have an obligation which must be enforced even by the use direct use of our armed forces I find--I'm not sure I can get the word for it--I find it not only incredible but immoral. And I also from a strictly practical point of view think that under such circumstances we would not only be ineffective in reaching our goals but would almost assure that the last condition of that country would be worse than the one in which we had started out.

SAN FRANCISCO--Teenagers flocked to the conference room of the Holiday Inn on Wednesday, Feb. 16 where popular Hong Kong entertainer Jenny gave a brief press conference.


Wearing a white woolen dress in the latest new wave fashion, the singer chatted candidly with reporters and fans about her career and personal life.


""After this tour I will be going back to Hong Kong to finish an album which I am doing with Lo Mun,"" she said in Cantonese, ""then I'll take a break for about one and a half years. After 11 years in this business, I think I deserve a break.""


One fan asked if she was taking a break to have a baby. ""No,"" she laughed, ""I don't have a big stomach. Does it look like I'm going to have a baby?""


Asked if her husband of seven years, Fu Seng, a popular Hong Kong martial arts expert, wanted a baby boy or girl, Jenny quipped, ""He's lucky if I give him a baby at all.""


She and her husband have separate careers, and do not plan to work together. ""My husband is still making movies, all about chasing girls,"" she said.


Jenny wrote three songs on her soon-to-be-released album and hopes to write more. She gave a two-hour concert at the Masonic Auditorium in The City on Sunday, Feb. 27, and also performed at the Miss Chinatown USA Coronation ceremony.


After her concerts in San Francisco, which marked her third visit to the U.S., her tour will move on to the cities of Los Angeles on March 3, Vancouver on March 4 and Houston on March 9. She will return to Hong Kong on March 10.

The Pacific Alumni Association of the University of the Pacific, Stockton, California, invited my class of '34 to return on May 12th for the 50th Reunion. Good grief, 50 years have passed since we left the cloistered halls of C.O.P.? The school is now known as the University of the Pacific. We had only 600 in our entire student body in 1934; today, the University have 5642 in all of its affliated colleges.


We were children of the Depression of the '30s and we saw Europe and the Pacific Basin went into flames in WWII. Since then there were Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, and now Central America. When we left the campus of the College, we were taught the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. In our 50th Reunion we are further and further from that Reality.


During my undergraduate days weekly Chapel and Assemby were compulsory. We had the opportunity to listen to the best spiritual and intellectual minds of our generation.


President Tully C. Knoles was a rare combination of a Methodist preacher and platform lecturer. Once a week he taught a class to the upper classmen, prior to his weekly radio broadcast; he opened the vista of the world for us. In those days the best Methodist preachers became bishops; Dr. Knoles inspired his students to become preachers and bishops. Bishops Gerald Kennedy and Wilbur W. Y. Choy came from the University of the Pacific.


Another Methodist clergyman taught the Bible at C.O.P. He was a prophet as well as a dedicated teacher. Dr. George H. Colliver was the chairman of Bible and Religious Education. He taught his students what were known as the ""Social Gospels"" and to be active in society. This was long before activitism was popular. In the Depression of the '30s it meant to challenge the status quo. It was not an easy task in the communities of Central California which were predominately agricultural.


I did not have a Christian background before I went to C.O.P. Anything compulsory was distasteful for me. Old Testament and New-Testament history were compulsory courses, but Dr. Colliver was a wise interpreter of the Bible. I can still hear him today teaching the social justice of Amos, the love of Hosea for his unfaithful wife, and the wisdom of a Micah interposing justice with mercy. Above all Dr. Colliver taught me to see Jesus as a compassionate redeemer for a sick society.


Dr. Robert E. Burns, onetime Field Rep. of C.O.P. who later became President of the University of the Pacific, was two classes ahead of me. He returned to the campus to woo Grace Weeks, a classmate of mine, and Bob married her later. Grace became the First Lady of the University. She will be at the class reunion in Stockton.


Under Dr. Burns and Mrs. Burns, our school grew from a small town college to a full-fledged University with the Dental School in San Francisco and the Law School in Sacramento.


While at C.O.P. I had many conflicting values. It was the depth of the Depression, and the Sino-Japanese War had started in Manchuria. Franklin D. Roosevelt ran against Herbert Hoover and Norman Thomas for President of the United States. The New Deal was not born and there were 15-17 million unemployed in the nation. Businesses went backrupt; banks had filed; ""bonus machers"" were in Washington, D.C.; factories were shut down; farms became dust bowls.


I told Bob Burns I had one emotional crisis after another. My philosophy of life was changed completely; my values were turned upside down; my directions were turned 180 degrees; I wondered at the time where can I go?


I found a friend and confidant in the Dean of the School of Education, Dr. J.W. Harris. Call it psychotherapy, or what you will, because that branch of science of human relations was not developed in the '30s. Whenever possible. I had what is known today as ""counseling sessions"" with Dr. Harris. I began to see life steadily and saw it whole, in the words of Matthew Arnold. Under the influence of Dr. Knoles, Dr. Colliver and Dr. Harris; I thought I wanted to be a pastor. I got a scholarship to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.


The political animal in me was too strong to control. In a year I became the President of the Chinese Students' Association of Southern California. (That is another story for the future.)


I shall return to Stockton on May 12, 1984, to join my classmates for the 50th Reunion. We shall march together with the Class of '84. We shall be inducted in the Half Century Club.


With fond memories of the green lawns of the College, the Conservatory of Music and the sunken garden with its reflection pool, how we wish we can have the last 50 years to do over again. On a second thought maybe not. Not many of us in the Class of '34 will be able to return to the reunion. Age and the adversities of life have taken their tolls. World War II and Korea, and perhaps even Vietnam may have reduced our rank. The departed will only march with us in spirit. President Knoles, President Burns, Dean Harris, Professor Colliver and other saintly teachers will be taking the roll call in Heaven.


The faculty in their colorfull academic gowns, the proud parents, the siblings of the graduating class and the Class of '84 will sing the Pacific Hymn one more time and then walk into the world to face the next 50 years we left behind. Good Luck!

SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying the Chinese American community holds a ""pivotal"" vote in The City, Kevin Starr pledged to develop a ""solid working relationship"" with the Chinese if they help elect him to the Board of Supervisors.


In an interview with Asian Week, Starr emphasized the important role Asian cultures have played in the history of San Francisco and projected that The City's prominence as a gateway to trade and relations with the Pacific Basin will make Asian culture an even more important aspect of life here.


""Twenty years from now I see the Asian Art Museum being located in the Yerba Buena Center downtown; I see a Chinese American mayor being elected, and Chinatown being able to build more housing and parking structures,"" Starr predicted.


A former S.F. Examiner columnist, New West Magazine editor, city librarian and historian, university professor and one-time executive aide to Mayor Joseph Alioto, Starr has spent his entire life in The City except for a stint in the military and at Harvard University, where he earned his Ph. D.


""While at the Examiner I wrote more than 1700 columns. I got to meet quite a few people,"" he noted. He said his long experience with San Francisco has given him insight into what directions The City will be moving as it enters the 21st century, and he sees Asian Americans playing a prominent role.


""We need a whole new structure of leadership geared toward the private sector. San Francisco government needs to be toned up, it needs to start listening to the communities again. Right now you've got the tall wagging the dog,"" he said.


The most important issue Starr sees facing San Francisco is its policy toward growth.


""All issues hinge upon us having a policy for proper growth. We need a concensus.


""I recently talked to a man who said he had advised a Chinese investor not to try coming to San Francisco right now because of the political confusion here. We should not be discouraging capital investment in our city. Not all growth is good, but we should be able to have growth occur in such a way that the general population will be able to participate in the resulting prosperity,"" Starr said.


Pointing out that Hong Kong has made ""very creative use of space"" to accomodate its more than five million people, Starr called for innovative solutions to the housing and parking problems in Chinatown, the most densely populated area west of New Jersey.


""The City has got to let you build to accomodate more people. A lot of the more extreme zoning laws have got to be re-thought.


""The cultural discipline of the Chinese is stronger, they can live in a high-rise situation quite comfortably,"" he continued. ""I live up on Chestnut Street, and my wife and I love to walk down Stockton Street in Chinatown -- with no fear of crime, I might add.""


Starr said Chinatown is a mecca for non-Asian residents as well as Chinese.


""Do you know how many non-Asian people do their shopping on Stockton Street? It's the best place in The City, especially for fish. That is a very special street for retail, and merchants should not be harassed by the police,"" he added, referring to the recent controversy over sidewalk displays of merchandise.


""When I am elected Supervisor, Chinatown's right to determine its own architecture and lifestyle will nto be brushed aside,"" he declared. ""We should not be harassing developers.""


Commenting on the growing Asian population and its influence on San Francisco, Starr said The City is entering a ""Golden Age"" when it will become unique in America.


""We should have the Asian Art Museum moved from Golden Gate Park to a newly built structure in the Yerba Buena Center,"" he proposed. ""The museum has got the best collection of Asian art in the country, but 90 percent of the collection remains downstairs, unexhibited. If elected, I promise to get a lot for a new museum at the YBC, which will give it direct access to Grant Avenue. We can get I.M. Pei to design it.""


On an issue of great concern to the Chinese American community, Starr said he way sorry to see Proposition O, the measure opposing bilingual ballots, passed by voters last November.


""I didn't like Proposition O -- it had an anti-immigrant tone to it. Chinese immigrants make the transition to English, but those who are 50 to 60 years old will not master the language well enough to read some ballot argument that's written like a State Department policy paper.


""Attacking bilingual ballots is discriminatory to elderly immigrants. I say give them a fair chance to make an educated vote,"" Starr said.


""I have great respect for Guy Wright (his former colleague at the Examiner), but on this issue I differ with him.""


Speaking as an historian, Starr said the current era will be marked as the period for the gradual joining of Eastern and Western cultures.


""You may be critical of Richard Nixon, but 100 years from now he will be seen as the pivotal President because he opened relations with China. And now the Chinese and other Asian countries are rapidly absorbing our technology and our capitalistic practices, while we are more gradually and subtly absorbing their culture, which is thousands of years older than our own.


""The Chinese were lighting the Imperial Palace with natural gas 2,000 years ago, but such lighting did not come to Europe until relatively recent times,"" he noted. ""We are now integrating aspects of Eastern medicine, philosophy and art with our own.""

LOS ANGELES -- An exhibition of 150 Japanese netwuke selected from the renowned collection of Raymond Bushell will be on view Nov. 21 through June 1985 at the L.A. County Museum of Art. Bushell's vast and extraordinary collection rarely has been exhibited and includes thousands of netsuke.


Netsuke are intricate miniature carvings used as toggles to attach an inro (carrying box) or sagemono (hanging pouch) to the traditional Japanese sash, called an obi. Generally made of wood, ivory or stag antler, netsuke represent a wide variety of subjects, including common themes from daily life, animals, and legendary and imaginary figures. As such, netsuke often reflect the culture and social life of Edo period Japan.


The word ""netsuke,"" (ne: root; tsuke; to fasten) denotes their utilitarian function. Netsuke became popular in the 18th century, as the result of several important historical events. After the Tokugawa shogun lifted the ban on tobacco in the 17th century, smoking became a popular pastime, and the lack of pockets in traditional Japanese clothing created the necessity for pouches for tobacco and pipes. The Tokugawa's edict forbidding unnecessary displays of wealth additionally encouraged the development of netsuke as luxurious personal adornment. The earliest netsuke were simple disks resembling rice cakes, or manju, but the medium developed as the rich merchant class actively commissioned elaborate designs for the necessary toggles.


Among the early netsuke on view in the exhibition are several dating from the beginning of the 18th century. Chinese artistic, philosophical and mythological traditions influenced these early pieces. Chinese Woman Holding Dog and Temple Guardian on view in the exhibition. were inspired by elongated carvings that surmounted Chinese seals and like Chinese sculptures show more attention to sculptural design than to surface detail.


Early netsuke carvers left their work unsigned because most were artisans specializing in other media Gradually, as techniques and individual style developed, a separate class of artists, or netsuke-shi, formed. Master carvers opened schools for teaching carving techniques, and soon these artists began to sign their works. Restricted only by the function and balance of the netsuke, netsuke-shi in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were challenged to create works depicting an increasingly broad range of subjects.


Early and middle 19th century netsuke became smaller and more functional, because the longer pieces had proved awkward to wear. The subject matter and treatment of these smaller netsuke developed as realism and technical proficiency became conventional Surface detail and overall modeling received equal attention. while artists increasingly drew their subjects from everyday life.


Mitsuhiro's Duck and Stylized Frog on view in the exhibition are typical examples of 19th century netsuke. Mitsuhiro stressed his technical virtuosity for example, by treating one material to look like another or by using the fineline engraving techniques of katakiri and kebori Through complex execution these works are distinguished by their simplicity of composition, their graceful, flowing lines and their beautifully proportioned masses.


Kaigyokusai's No Evil Monkey and Sleeping Cat exemplify the highly developed late 19th century netsuke The amber used for No Evil Monkey is a uniform shade of claret, as translucent and lustrous as it is rare. The Sleeping Cat reveals the artist's dexterity in carving whiskers and fur.


The opening of Japan to the West in the 1860s and the ensuing rush to adopt Western ideas and dress, including trousers with pockets, caused a decline in netsuke production, as they no longer served a functional purpose. The exhibition includes several examples of netsuke from the So School. among the last practitioners of the art, who worked into the 20th century. Soko, the master of this school, is noted for his meticulously carved netsuke of wood with a milk chocolate finish. Soko's Peony captures the flower in the shape it takes as a breeze blows through its petals. Contemporary netsuke carvers are producing miniature sculptures for a special home market or for Westerners who are collecting this once utilitarian art form.


Raymond Bushell, a leading netsuke scholar and collector, is the author of seven books and 40 articles on netsuke. A lawyer who lives in Japan, Bushell began collecting netsuke in 1945.

BANGKOK -- The emergence of a mysterious ""bathtub disease"" has affected businesses at massage parlors here, reports UPI.


Primarily a male malady, the disease has been found to be most easily contracted by clients of the city's massage houses, where a long, luxurious bath and scrubdown is part of the package.


""A large number of men who frequent massage parlors were found to be victims of the disease caused by excessive acid in shampoo and bathing soap,"" a local newspaper observed.


Quoting Dr. Voravit Lebnark, director of the Environmental Health Division of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the paper said the ""bathtub disease"" starts out with a rash and can lead to viral infection and hepatitis.


""Dr. Voravit does have a suggestion on how to avoid getting the bathtub disease -- stop visiting massage parlors,"" the paper noted. ""But if you can't help it, he said you should wash yourself clean immediately after getting out of the bathtub.""

Western Movies


Ingmar Bergman's ""After the Rehearsal,"" about a film director and his relations with women close to him, is fascinating but not, as some critics have said, the greatest Bergman. Its four characters reveal much about art and life, men ane women, and particularly good is Ingrid Thulin, long one of Bergman's ""stock company."" Well worth seeing, particularly for those involved with theater or film, but a small closet Bergman drama, not comparable to ""Fanny and Alexander"" or his other larger works.


""The Woman in Red,"" starring Gene Wilder, is an adaptation of a charming French sex comedy. Alas, one can only remember that ""they do these things so much better in France."" Wilder scripted and directed -- often over-directed. As the wimp hero he often has sensitive charm, in spite of often gross dialogue. And Kelly Le Brock is dazzling in the title role, the woman with whom he is fascinated. But the antics of Wilder and his macho buddies, played by Charles Grodin and Joseph Bologna, two actors I've long been able to do without, are as sophomoric and crude as any teen-age Porky's gang. Some really funny and touching scenes: Wilder, pursuing the heroine on a horse in Golden Gate Park, with the horse in total control; Wilder stranded on a ledge of the Mark Hopkins Hotel, clad only in a bathrobe, with a crowd urging him to jump -- these are inspired moments, but there aren't enough of them.

ATLANTA -- Investment capital from the Far East is starting to flow into Georgia.


Louis C. Robinson, a developer here, told Asian Week he is representing investors who have brought capital in from Hong Kong to help develop a 700-acre industrial park in an unincorporated area of the county about six miles from downtown Atlanta and seven miles from the airport. The Chinese language World Journal reported the capital came from the Tao Investment Company, owned by interests in Singapore.


Robinson hinted this may be the beginning of a trend, but that he isn't holding his breath.


""Asian investment is picking up a lot, but the Asian dollar usually stops on the West Coast. Most foreign investments in the Atlanta area have come from Europe in the past,"" he said.


Robinson said he hopes an influx of Asian capital will not inflate property values and rents as has been the case in other cities, but at the same time he pointed out that real estate in Georgia is less expensive than in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth, other cities which have attracted the attention of Asian investors. He said Atlanta wouldn't mind an infusion of capital.


""We are quite pleased that they are looking at Georgia,"" he said.


Robinson said 600,000 square feet of industrial development is currently under construction and will be open within six months, and streets and sewers are being installed. Some of the areas in the rest of the 700 acres are somewhat hilly and might be better suited to residential development, he said.


One of the companies currently building a plant in the industrial park is the Sanwa Chinese noodle company of Los Angeles.


Mayor Andrew Young has reportedly expressed a great deal of interest in the project. City officials have scheduled a public hearing next month to solicit public opinion on more development.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The presentation of the platform drafted by the Asian Pacific American Caucus of the Democratic Party got a warm reception from the party's Platform Committee, said APA Caucus Chairman Thomas Hsieh.


""This is really a history-making event for us -- to give a comprehensive position paper to the national party and have it received so well,"" Hsiah said.


""There were over 30 groups presenting position papers, and ours was picked to be heard first. There are about 200 people on the Platform Committee, and they gave us a round of applause after we had made our presentation,"" Hsieh added.


Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraldo of New York introduced the Asian group, pointing out that Asian caucuses have been officially established with the Democratic Party in 20 states now.


The proposed platform of the national Democratic Party will be examined in six regional hearings throughout the country before the final draft is presented at the convention in San Francisco in July.


The proposed platform of the APA Caucus focuses on five general areas:


Civil rights, and the continuing rise of anti-Asian bigotry and violence;


Redress and reparations for Japanese Americans interned in camps during World War II;


Economic and social services, including minority business development and bilingual issues;


Immigration law;


Greater representation and participation of Asian Americans in elected and appointed positions.


In a related development, the Asian Pacific Caucus of New York held its first event last week, a candidates' forum.


More than 100 people braved the snow and rain to attend the forum, which featured representatives for former Vice President Walter Mondale, Senator Gary Hart and Reverend Jesse Jackson.

The enduring beauty of wood is the focus of this year's Seattle Cherry Blossom and Japanese Cultural Festival May 2 to 6 at the Seattle Center.


Dozens of displays and demonstrations of fine Japanese wood crafts and arts will be featured. There will be performances by the Kagami Brothers of Tokyo; a comic juggling magic act, and Japanese dancers, musicians and martial artists.


The five-day festival, now in its ninth year, will coincide with the ongoing exhibit at the Pacific Science Center, ""China: 7,000 Years of Discovery.""


Displays of Japanese wood arts will include over 15 types of crafts and will feature many demonstrations by masters from Japan. Among the wood arts high-lighted are: woodblock printing, Noh mask carving, toys, footwear, trays, religious objects and Buddhist sculptures.


Displays will be located in the Flag Pavilion, while the main performing arts will be staged in the Center House. The opening ceremonies are slated for Friday, May 4 at 6 p.m.


The performing arts that will be featured are: traditional music and dance, the martial arts of karate, judo, kendo and aikido, and the rhythmic drumming of Seattle Taiko.


A regular part of the festival is the presentation of the traditional arts of tea ceremony, bonsai, ikebana flower arrangement, poetry recitation and calligraphy and the games of go and shogi. Films and videotapes of Japanese life and culture also will be shown throughout the festival.


A heartwarming part of the festival each year is the display of children's art from Kobe, Japan, Seattle's sister city. This year, May 5 is Children's Day in Japan.


To open this festival of culture, a mikoshi, or portable Japanese shrine, will be brought out by members of Isezaki Shinto Shrine in Gumma Prefecture. The ornate shrine is five feet tall, weights about 800 lbs and serves as the focal point of raucous religious festival parades in Japan. Members of the Seattle audience will be invited to join the Mikoshi parade here.


The entire Cherry Blossom Festival is free and open to the public. It is produced through the cooperation of several Japanese community cultural groups and attracts crowds of 10,000 to 15,000 people each year.

Asian Americans are often stereotyped as being too ""quiet,"" ""modest"" and ""passive."" To some extent this is true--depending on the situation.


But in American society, being quiet or passive has its definite drawbacks.


""Americans are geared toward a very competitive society,"" said Sue Hayashi, a guidance counselor at San Francisco State University, who once taught an assertiveness training workshop for Asians.


""To be competitive, you have a better chance if you know how to speak your peace. The positive stereotype of Asians is that they're super polite. But then there's also the negative stereotypes: Asians are sly, not upfront, not candid, not direct or Asians don't express themselves verbally or behaviorally.""


A bicultural person should ""adapt"" to the dominant society, Hayashi said. People who don't are at a disadvantage, especially in the business world. She said recruiters from corporations often see Aslan students as quiet and passive.


""And this can be read as negative for companies who are looking for certain types. The recruiter doesn't like it when he has to pull information out of you. They think, 'If I have to do that here, how are they going to perform on the job with customers?'""


Hayashi said that because of negative stereotypes, members of the dominant society have a difficult time ""reading"" Asian Americans as to how they're thinking and what they're really feeling.


She said that if Asian want to compete in this society, they have to be assertive. But she stressed that assertiveness is not aggressiveness.


She gave an example:


Person A asks a simple question:


""Can you throw this out for me?""


The aggressive response: ""Who do you think you are?! Throw it away yourself!""


The assertive response: (said calmly) ""You know, the garbage can is right there.""


The timid response: ""You know, the garbage can is right there, but I'll throw it away anyway.""


The aggressive response did not consider the other person. In fact, it was almost an attack. The assertive response was said calmly, but strong enough to let the other person know that he would have to throw away his own garbage. The passive response speaks for itself.


""The key is how to become more assertive without losing your respect and the other person's respect,"" Hayashi said.


But for many Asian Americans, it's not easy to become more assertive all of a sudden.


Hayashi cited some examples.


""A lot of times Asians are not able to get the rights they should. They're not able to refuse, or disagree or complain. They don't know how to turn off a nasty person who's been bothering them without being rude or walking away.""


She said that culture has a lot to do with Asians and their lack of assertiveness.


""In the Asian culture it's impolite to make direct eye contact, but to be assertive you need eye contact."" She also said Asians are often non-expressive with their facial expressions.


""I've seen Asians who smile when they're mad. They're careful not to show anger. It's impolite, and you're losing control. Asians are always supposed to have control of their actions and behavior.""


So how do Asians become more assertive?


For some Asian students at San Francisco State the answer was joining an assertiveness training workshop which Hayashi taught for five years.


The students shared their experiences and role played situations such as getting rid of someone who was bothering them, while being recorded on video tape. Seeing themselves on tape helped them make corrections, and through the role playing they learned that the best response was not rude or angry, but polite and civil, yet firm.


""After nine weeks, it's amazing to see the changes,"" Hayashi said.


Some changed after a few weeks. Some changed after nine weeks. Becoming more assertive is something that definitely doesn't happen overnight.


""It's hard. There's certain parts of me that I can't change,"" Hayashi said. To change, Hayashi suggested practicing certain situations with family or friends and also reading books on assertiveness.


""The first time you're going to feel awkward, and sometimes you'll fail. But that's okay. That's how you learn. And by learning, you'll know how to do it another way next time.""

Recently, architect Ed Sue, founder of Ed Sue AIA Associates in Oakland, was asked to replace the late Kenneth B. Hoh's position on the governing board of Peralta College District.


The college district, with its 30,000 students, includes the College of Alameda, Laney and Merritt Colleges in Oakland, Vista College in Berkeley, and Feather River College in Plumas County. The district also administers the East Bay Skills Center in Oakland.


Sue candidly admitted that when he was approached to run for the vacant seat on the seven-member college board, he was a little reluctant to do so. ""I felt that there were so many more resourceful people around who could do the job better than myself, but my wife, Amy, suggested that it might be good for me to try something new.


""Being involved in a public office is a totally new experience for me. After my acceptance. I was surprised at how quickly the press was alerted to the news, and I was flattered when the Oakland Tribune and other news agencies asked for an interview. Suddenly, I was aware that people wanted to know more about me and I must confess, I like it!""


There were twelve applicants contending for the board. After the six current members interviewed the five top contenders, Sue was unanimously chosen to fill the vacancy.


His appointment to the trusteeship will continue into the spring of 1985. At that time, Sue will have to run for re-election and be voted into the office.


However, there was talk of his disqualification from the post because he was not a registered voter.


However, Asian Week contacted the President of the . . . College Board, Booker T. Jackson, in regard to the matter. Jackson's response was that ""as far asthe board is concerned, Ed Sue is a legally constituted member of the board.""

South of Seattle's downtown, the International District, otherwise known as Chinatown, sits inconspicuously. It's not a major attraction like San Francisco's Chinatown.


Seattleites speak proudly of Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, the Waterfront, University District and even Capitol Hill. But never the International District.


It doesn't have chic restaurants full of ferns. Just plain Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean and Vietnamese eating places. The area isn't exotic. Not enough Buddhist temples, curio shops, bamboo or rickshaws. Besides, the neighborhood looks sort of run-down despite the new and renovated buildings and the decorated street lights and brick-paved sidewalks. The International District is just there.


But, mainly, little is known of the International District because it is different. Its commerce and people are predominantly Asian American. The District is an urban, ethnic neighborhood. It is one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, with roots that begin with the founding of Seattle. It is also an area which was settled and developed by Asian Americans. The only area in America where Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos settled together.


The District is an enclave that has overcome many obstacles and changes. It continues to perservere as an Asian American community while other such immigrant colonies have vanished.


But clearly, the history of the International District is not merely the story of the growth, development and changes of a neighborhood. The history of the District is the story of Asian Americans in Seattle. It is a history of bitter struggle and perseverance. The experience of a neighborhood and people trying to adjust and find a rightful place.


The history of the International District begins with the emergence of Chinese immigration.


The Chinese who came to North America were mostly from seven districts: Namboi, Punyu, and Shuntak (where the people spoke the Sam Yup Cantonese dialect), and Sunwui, Hoiping, Yanping, and Toishan (where the people spoke the Sze Yup dialect). All seven districts are in Kwangtung Province, on the Pearl River Delta south of Canton.


In the middle of the nineteenth century, circumstances in Kwangtung Province as well as the United States encouraged immigration to North America.


In 1849, when the wave of Chinese immigration to North America began, China had just lost the Opium War, which was fought against the British who had insisted that China buy opium from them. China had lost its prestige as a nation. Additionally, there was widespread exploitation of peasants by ruthless landlords, famine and ""over-population."" Heavy floods in the Pearl River Delta made conditions worse.


Meanwhile, in the United States, gold was discovered in California in 1849. Stanford Lyman, a scholar on Chinese Americans, wrote: ""The announcement that gold had been discovered in California, that the passage was cheap, that indentured labor could be secured, and that Chinese merchants had already pioneered a settlement electrified the peasants and handcraftsmen who had begun to overcrowd the port cities of Canton, Macao, and Hong Kong.""


In the years that followed, the Tai Ping Rebellion (1850-1864), an uprising of peasants in southeastern China, uprooted the ""Mandate of Heaven,"" by which the emperor of China ruled. This uprising, which shook the political and social fiber of the country, created rebellion among the peasants and a deepening feeling of discontent towards their country. Meanwhile, the increasing demand for ""cheap labor"" in America's Western Frontier provoked capitalists and their agents to recruit additional Chinese labor.


By 1880, more than 300,000 Chinese had come to the United States. Most were male sojourners who had come to America with the intention of staying for a short period of time to seek economic gain, then return to China. At the time of the first Chinese Exclusion Act, in 1882, over half of those who migrated to this country returned to China, including a few who made their expected fortune.


San Francisco was the main port of entry for the Chinese. Although this city was to become the main Chinese settlement in America, by 1870, Chinese could be found throughout the western United States, particularly in California, working in a variety of occupations: farming, railroad construction, mining, fishing and canning, and in the woolen, cigar, textile, and show industries. Chinese also served as domestic workers, doing laundry, cooking, and house-cleaning because of the shortage of men to do ""women's work.""


The first recorded Chinese in the Pacific Northwest came here in 1789. They were part of Captain Mears' crew which landed on Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. No one knows what happened to them, but there is some speculation they integrated with the native Indians. Other Chinese joined the crews of British ships which came to the Northwest as part of the Canton trade route. But, these Chinese crewmen never settled here.


The 1850 census showed that there was one Chinese in the territory. He was nineteen-year-old Ah-long, a servant to Captain Rufus Ingles at Vancouver Barracks in Clark County. There is no record of what happened to him.


Ten years later, there was still only one Chinese recorded in the territorial census. He was probably Chin Chun Hock, also on record as the first Chinese resident in Seattle. He came here in 1860 and began as a domestic worker, just nine years after the first white settler, Arthur Denny, landed at Alki Point.


In 1867, Chen Cheong began manufacturing cigars on Commercial Street (now Occidental Avenue). He has the distinction of being the first Chinese to begin a business in this city, and the first person to establish a cigar business in what was then Washington Territory.


One year later, Chin Hock took his savings and began a general merchandising store. The Wa Chong Company, as it was called, opened next to the tideflats just south of Henry Yesler's lumber mill on the foot of Mill Street (now Yesler Way). The store advertised as a manufacturer of cigars and a dealer in sugar, tea, and Chinese goods. Some years later, the company advertised an added feature, opium, apparently legal at the time.


Chin Hock, taking opportunity of the growing Chinese population and the need for workers, also became a labor contractor. His company additionally labeled itself as a ""Chinese Intelligence Office"" in its ads, asking anyone wanting to employ Chinese to contact him.


The Wa Chong Company became, by far, the largest Chinese business in Seattle; and Chin Hock became a very wealthy and powerful person in the community. By the time he died, Chin had married 13 times. One of his wives was the daughter of Chief Sealth.


By 1870, there were 234 Chinese in the territory, but only a few in Seattle. Most were in eastern Washington seeking gold. They followed the trail of white miners from California and worked their abandoned mines. With the depletion of gold in that region, many headed west of the Cascades to Puget Sound to work on the railroads or in the coal mines, hop farms, lumber mills, fishing industry and in other jobs.


Largely because of Henry Villard, who financed railroads and allied industries, Seattle's economy steadily grew during the next decade. Two of his major projects, the Northern Pacific and the Oregon Improvement Company, eventually were instrumental in bringing the Chinese to Seattle. The Northern Pacific's terminus point was nearby Tacoma and, at one time, employed 15,000 Chinese laborers, many of whom were shipped here to work on the project. The Oregon Improvement Company was an exporter of soft coal and had many Chinese working in its coal mines around Seattle. Another railroad project, the construction of the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroads, which Villard's firm eventually controlled, also employed many Chinese.


By 1873, there were 100 Chinese among the city's 2,000 inhabitants.


The Chinese, a source of reliable and ""cheap labor,"" attracted capitalist entrepreneurs interested in expanding or venturing into new businesses, and others who demanded that the territory develop rapidly. At the same time, many Chinese sought employment opportunities wherever possible in order to quickly return to their homeland and family.


Within Puget Sound, many Chinese laborers were contracted out to various job locations by Chinese labor contractors headquartered in Seattle. Once their jobs were completed, most laborers headed for Seattle or Tacoma, which was the largest town in the area at the time, to seek other employment. Some of the more fortunate Chinese accumulated enough money working in the outlying areas and came to Seattle, and eventually became successful labor contractors themselves.


As the economy of the city grew, others came here from China. Some arrived here through Port Townsend, where the U.S. customs house was located. Others came via Port Gamble and Port Blakely, where they had worked in lumber mills. In 1874, the first boat run between China and Seattle took place. Some Chinese came here from points as far south as Portland, and as far north as Canada.


In 1876, the city's population reached 3,400, of which 250 were Chinese. There was an additional ""floating"" population of 300, the transient Chinese labor force contracted to the various work sites, as noted earlier.


Until the mid-1870s, the Chinese quarter was primarily a base for Chinese merchants. Thereafter, a commercial-residential area developed as increasing numbers of Chinese found work in the city.


During this time, the Chinese quarters gradually shifted from the Commercial-Mill Street area to Washington Street, between Second and Third Avenues. The new location of the Chinese quarters, next to an area similar to San Francisco's infamous Barbary Coast, was only several blocks away from the initial area.


Chin Hock led the shift by moving his prosperous Wa Chong Company to Third and Washington Street. Soon thereafter, other Chinese merchants leased buildings along Washington Street from wealthy white property owners.


According to one early settler, the movement of Chinese into the area brought about such resentment by whites that it resulted in the depreciation of property values and the unnatural growth of the city's business district.


""It instantly depreciated all surrounding property for business purposes,"" wrote J. Willis Sayres in his book, This City Of Ours. ""It is entirely likely that had it not been for those Chinese leases just at that time, business in Seattle would have followed the easier grades of lower Washington, Main and Jackson Streets, instead of going up the steep hill of First Avenue, which was a high bank on the east side and a drop off to the waterfront on the west side.""


The new location quickly became congested. ""In 1877, Washington Street was Chinese Headquarters,"" wrote Clarence Bagley, the late University of Washington history professor. ""On that street there were twenty-seven Chinese houses in about a half a block . . . During any alarm of fire they poured out like rats from a burning house.""


The Chinese engaged in a variety of occupations within the city. Some worked in small businesses owned and operated by Chinese merchants. These small laundries restaurants, and dry goods stores were patronized by whites and Indians as well as Chinese. The Indians, in fact, regularly patronized the dry goods stores and some Chinese employees learned Indian sign language and Siwash (an Indian language).


Other Chinese peddled vegetables which had been planted at either of two gardens: one in the northern section of town on what is now the Seattle Center; and the other on the Duwamish River, south of the city's commercial area. Some worked in factories; others became domestic laborers. Still others found jobs in lumber mills. Some worked on public works projects such as street clearing and paving. A gang of Chinese dug the first canal connecting Lake Union with Lake Washington. Other Chinese engaged in net fishing in Elliot Bay. There was even one Chinese who peddled ice cream on a converted wheelbarrow.


In 1882, a school for Chinese children was established at the Methodist Episcopal Church at Fourth and Columbia. About 40 children attended these classes. According to Bagley, the classes were taught by two women: ""The efforts of these two ladies and of the church to better the conditions of the Chinese and their customs were commended by the newspapers of that date."" Such recognition, it might be added, suggests a racist attitude towards Chinese culture, inferring that it was inferior to American culture.


Economic conditions grew worse in the early 1880s when a depression swept the country. As conditions got worse, antagonism towards the Chinese increased. By the time of the anti-Chinese riots in Seattle, in 1885-1886, there were about 400 Chinese in the city, a small increase in 10 years.


Antagonism towards the Chinese existed in the Territory of Washington even before Chinese arrived in large numbers. When Washington Territory was created in 1853, legislators immediately adopted a measure denying them franchise. It is doubtful that there was even one Chinese in the territory in that year, although there is a record of one in the territory before then.


By the mid-1860's, after a scattering of Chinese began to make their appearance, territorial legislators passed additional anti-Chinese laws. One law barred Chinese from providing evidence against whites in court cases; another measure was entitled, ""An Act To Protect Free White Labor Against Competition With Chinese Coolie Labor And To Discourage The Immigration Of Chinese In The Territory."" The later law resulted in the ""Chinese Police Tax,"" a poll tax levied against every Chinese residing in the territory.


As the legislation suggests, the Chinese were unwelcomed as settlers in the territory. As in California, the white settlers wanted to develop the territory for white Americans.


But, until the 1880's, overt hostility towards the Chinese was not continuous. In railroad construction, for example, whites generally reacted without hostility to the employment of Chinese laborers. According to historian Robert E. Wynne, ""The work was so obviously needed and all groups and areas vied with each other to entice a company to build a railroad in their area that they would have welcomed the devil himself had he built a road . . . the lack of white labor was too evident to cause even the most ardent anti-Chinese to resent their employment on such work."" On other occasions, the arrival of shiploads of Chinese was greeted by cheering white Washingtonians. The importation of Chinese was a sign of economic prosperity and growth.


At other times, however, overt violence was directed towards the Chinese. In Sultan, a small town northeast of Seattle, neither the whites nor the Indians liked them and eventually the Chinese prospectors were run off their claims. On another occasion, a Chinese labor contractor had to write a letter protesting the mistreatment of Chinese laborers by whites at a lumber mill at Port Blakely. As a general rule, the violence towards the Chinese increased as the number of Chinese grew.


By the mid-1870's, local newspapers and politicians frequently focused on the ""Chinese problem."" The Daily Pacific Tribune, on December 27, 1877, referred to the Chinese as ""money leapers"" when commenting on the departure of Chinese to Hong Kong. A Seattle newspaper, discussing the illegal entry of some Chinese, remarked, ""If there is any cute trick in which Ah Sing is not equal of Brother Jonathon or any other man, it hasn't yet been put before the eyes of a curious public."" That same year, an article in the Snohomish Northern Star read:


We are glad to be able to chronicle one fact in relation to the Puget Sound Fisheries. We are informed that Tull & Co. formerly of Mukilteo, now of Seattle after a careful trail they discharged all of their Chinamen and employ White men in their places. We are glad there is one firm operating our fisheries for the benefit of our own country instead of the Mongolian empire. There are hundreds of White men on this coast, who are knocking at our doors for work, yet ""capital"" brands them ""tramps,"" casts them aside, and negotiates with some ""Boss"" of a Chinaman for a cargo of coolies to flood our land with this class of laborers, and grind the face of our poor still deeper into the dust, Shame.


With completion of the railroads and the onset of a depression in the early 1880's, the anti-Chinese movement in Seattle and the rest of Washington reached a crescendo. The Northern Pacific was completed in 1883, and the Canadian Pacific was completed two years later. Many Chinese employed in the construction work evaded the Exclusion Act of 1882 to come to Seattle. In Seattle, they competed with whites for jobs in a saturated market.


The poor economic and social conditions encouraged scapegoating of the Chinese. They were of a different racial and ethnic stock, and had constantly been labeled as ""unfair labor competition."" American and European foreigners, alike, favored removal of Chinese from the territory. Led by the Knights of Labor, who, by 1894, had held many anti-Chinese meetings west of the Cascades, and ""prominent Seattleites,"" the anti-Chinese movement in Seattle effectively resolved the ""Chinese problem"" in 1885-86.


The immediate spark that precipitated the anti-Chinese outbreaks in Seattle was the riot in September, 1885, at Rock Springs, Wyoming where 28 Chinese were murdered and over 500 were driven out of town. On the night of September 5, a group of whites and Indians armed with rifles ambushed a camp of 35 Chinese at a hop farm in Squak Valley (now Issaquah) a few miles east of Seattle, killing three and injuring three. Five whites and two Indians were indicted, but after an eight-day trial they were acquitted. On September 19, the Chinese were driven out of the coal mining town of Black Diamond, south of Seattle; nine Chinese were also injured. Towards the end of that same month, another coal mine near Seattle was cleared of Chinese. Also in the same month, a party of masked and armed men entered the Franklin Mines and forced their Chinese victims on a special train to Seattle. Similar incidents were reported in Newcastle and Renton. In all of these incidents, no one was brought to trial.


The predicament of the Chinese in Seattle was the same as in the surrounding areas. Four days after the Squak Valley incident, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reminded the public of the nuisance of Chinese in their midst. ""The civilization of the Pacific Coast,"" the P-I reporter remarked, ""cannot be half Caucasian and half Mongolian."" Such a statement, of course, had no basis in fact since the Chinese only constituted a small percentage of the population; four years earlier, Chinese immigration was nearly totally curtailed with passage of the first Chinese Exclusion Act. Nevertheless, the P-I article did exemplify the Sinophobia that prevailed at the time and suggests that racial and cultural differences played as significant a role in the anti-Chinese sentiment as economic factors. Interestingly, before the anti-Chinese outbreaks in Seattle and Tacoma, nearly all of the Chinese were unemployed.


During the outbreaks of 1885-86, the anti-Chinese movement in Seattle consisted of two major groups. One group, referred to as the ""anti-Chinese,"" favored direct removal of the Chinese, physically running the Chinese out of town. They were led by the Knights of Labor and were primarily working men, white Americans and foreigners. The ""Law and Order"" group consisted primarily of ""prominent"" citizens and city officials. These ""taxpayers and property owners"" favored removal of Chinese through legislative action. Apparently, this group tempered their hostility with concern over: the reputation of the territory and the chances of Washington gaining Statehood; the future of international trade and the possibility of Seattle becoming the ""Gateway to the Orient""; and the property damages that might result if violence broke out.


On September 28, 1885, the first of two meetings was called by the anti-Chinese group. At that meeting, the ""Anti-Chinese Congress"" resolved that the Chinese must leave western Washington by November 1. On October 10, a committee formed as a result of the meeting invaded the Chinese quarters and warned the Chinese to leave.


On October 24, about 2,500 persons participated in an anti-Chinese demonstration called by the anti-Chinese faction. Notified of the hostile situation in Seattle, F.A. Bee, Chinese Vice-Consul in San Francisco, telegramed Territorial Governor Squire to inquire about his ability to protect the Chinese. Meanwhile, both the anti-Chinese and Law and Order groups agreed to meet with Chinese leaders.


This meeting with five Chinese labor bosses ended with an agreement for the Chinese to depart. The labor bosses only asked that the Chinese be permitted a reasonable amount of time to gather their belongings, dispose of property, and collect unpaid debts.


On November 3, one day before the meeting with Chinese leaders, the loyal citizens of Tacoma loaded their 700 Chinese onto wagons, hauled them out to trains headed for Portland, then returned, two days later, to burn down the Chinese quarters. This incident heightened the tension in Seattle and did much to reaffirm the anti-Chinese group's belief that their strategy of direct action was the appropriate means of removing the Chinese. Frightened by the Tacoma incident and the hostile atmosphere in Seattle, 150 Chinese left by boat and train during the next three days following that incident.


But the actions of the Chinese apparently did little to diffuse the hostile situation. On November 8, the Secretary of War ordered federal troops to Seattle. The following day, 350 soldiers from Fort Vancouver arrived in Seattle with Governor Squire. However, from the actions of these troops, it is difficult to argue that they were there to protect the Chinese.


The uniformed visitors committed a number of brutal attacks on the Orientals, of which six were formally reported. Four Chinese were beaten up in apparently unprovoked assaults; one had his queue cut off; and another was thrown into the bay. In addition, according to one reporter, a group of soldiers visited the Chinese quarters on the night of November 9 to collect a special tax from each Oriental. This foray was supposed to have netted approximately $150. After discussing these outrages the Call remarked: 'The chances are that the people will be called on to protect the Chinese.


On November 17, the troops returned to Fort Vancouver.


During the following two months, people waited for legislative action to remove the Chinese and the conspiracy trials of leaders of the anti-Chinese group. In an attempt to divide the anti-Chinese faction, 17 Seattle residents were charged with conspiring to deny Chinese of their legal rights. After 14 days of testimony, the jury deliberated for ten minutes and handed down a 'not guilty' verdict. This action, and the failure of the city council and territorial legislature to pass effective measures disposing of the Chinese, brought about more hostility and strengthened the forces favoring direct action.


On Sunday morning, February 7, following a meeting of the anti-Chinese group the night before, an appointed committee and their followers invaded the Chinese quarters and notified the Chinese that they were going to be sent away that afternoon on the steamer ""Queen of the Pacific."" Most of the 350 Chinese in Seattle were forced on wagons and hauled to the dock. From that point, according to one historical account, ""most of the Chinese were eager to get aboard and away from Seattle, but had no funds. The majority of them were in Seattle because they could not find employment in the mines or mills, had no money to move on, or were in debt to the local bosses for their passage from China and had no surety save themselves.""


The departure of the Chinese was delayed a day because of a writ of habeas corpus sworn out by a Chinese merchant who alleged that his countrymen were unlawfully detained aboard a ship. Meanwhile, the anti-Chinese raised sufficient funds to pay the fare of 188 Chinese, at seven dollars per head. Eight Chinese managed to pay their own fare. Thus, 196 Chinese, the legal limit of passengers permitted on the ship, left Seattle February 8. When the remaining Chinese were marched back to the Chinese quarters, shots were exchanged between the guards and the crowd; one man was killed and four were injured.


The incident provoked Governor Squire to proclaim a state of insurrection, declare martial law, suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and request federal troops. At first, his demand for troops was turned down by an Army officer on the grounds that troops can be sent only upon ""last emergency,"" but, when prominent citizens of the city became alarmed and sent telegrams to congressmen, President Cleveland sent troops. On February 10, eight companies of the 14th Infantry returned to Seattle.


When the next steamer arrived in Seattle, February 14, 110 Chinese boarded. The rest of the Chinese were scheduled to leave on the next steamer.


On February 22, civil law was restored in Seattle, but it was not until July that federal troops left. By this time, only a handful of Chinese remained -- a few laundrymen and domestic servants. Anti-Chinese sentiments, meanwhile, were maintained by newspapers and public speakers. In the city and county elections of that year, the ""People's Party,"" organized by the anti-Chinese group, made clean sweeps.


A couple of years after the riots, slightly fewer than 300 Chinese remained among Seattle's 30,000 inhabitants. Economic conditions in Seattle had begun to improve, helping mellow the anti-Chinese feeling considerably. Chinese laborers, once again, were recruited to work at logging and sawmill operations, do street paving and land diggings and provide domestic services. Additionally, some Chinese merchants wanted to re-establish their businesses. In other areas, however, the Chinese were still persecuted and hated. One year after the Seattle outbreaks, in 1877, seven white men massacred 31 Chinese miners on the Snake River in southeastern Washington. Nearby Tacoma, although it had the largest number of Chinese in the territory before the outbreaks, never re-established a Chinese quarter.


During the last decade of the nineteenth century, Seattle's economy rapidly grew. After the wide-spread fire of June 6, 1889, many laborers were needed for re-construction. Publicity from the fire brought in additional people and businesses, including what the city had fought hard for -- the Northern Pacific Railroad. Yet, when 40 Chinese arrived in Ballard, a district of Seattle, in early 1892, the Seattle Press Times warned the public of hordes of ""boat loads (of Chinese) coming."" A man, described by the newspaper as an experienced employee of the custom house, cautioned: ""These Chinamen . . . are of the class of fellows who usually get into this country. They are gamblers, convicts and murderers. Fully, one-third of these Chinese that come to this country have some sort of crime hanging over their heads. Chinese are safer in this country than elsewhere. . . . There are a number of highbinders in this city.""


The sentiments of Washington's Senator Squire, the former territorial governor, echoed the feelings of many white Washingtonians and suggests that anti-Chinese agitation remained strong in the 1890's. In a May, 1892 speech before the U.S. Senate on the Gerry Chinese Exclusion, he remarked:


. . . I ascertain from personal observation that a very large portion of the Chinese on the Pacific Coast are of a kind whose presence is deleterious to the best interest of society. . . .


I may be permitted to urge the view which is naturally taken by Americans of the Pacific Coast, that it is important to have the country settled by free American laborers who have respect for the institutions and laws of our country; who will establish permanent homes, and who will rear their families and train their children to have proper respect for labor even in its humbliest sphere . . . the hiring of hordes of Chinese in the towns is thought to interfere with the healthy growth and development of society, and is a constant source of uneasiness and dissatisfaction to the white laborer.


In retrospect, while the depression contributed to driving Chinese to Seattle, it also provided a rationale for whites to drive them out. The slow growth of the Chinese population (an increase in Seattle of only 100 from 1880 to 1890; and an increase of 438 from 1890 to 1900) largely reflects the intensity of the anti-Chinese movement and the effects of the Chinese Exclusion Acts.

FLINT, Mich. -- A poster described by Congressman Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento) as ""racially offensive"" and denounced by Asian Americans across the country has been removed from public display at the Six Flags' Auto World here.


The exhibit showed a car depicted as a caricature of a Japanese plane dropping bombs on Detroit against the background of the ""rising sun"" used on Japanese flags before World War II. The flying automobile had bucked teeth and slanted eyes.


Kathy Schoch, public relations manager at the theme park, said in a Rafu Shimpo article that the poster, and others in the exhibit, were removed at the beginning of the month ""as part of a regular rotation of exhibits."" A Mercedes Benz display replaced the exhibit.


Expressing surprise over the uproar caused by the poster which she described as being ""very satirical,"" Schoch said that ""Six Flags Autoworld didn't originate the poster (anyway). It appeared on a calendar created by a Detroit ad agency.""


Stressing that the contoversial artwork was removed as part of routine change in exhibits and not because of the protests, Schooh added that the poster is now in storage and she did not know if it would be publicly displayed again.

. . ., Thailand -- The number of Hmong crossing the border into Thailand from Laos has doubled this year, despite the fact that they are not welcome.


According to Barbara Crossette of the New York Times, as many as 10,000 Hmong has crossed the border in the last six or seven months, twice as many during the same period last year.


But the Thai government no longer considers the migrants as refugees deserving humanitarian consideration and assistance; they are now illegal aliens, and the government is trying to stop the flow of Hmong into this country.


Ban Vinai, originally a refugee camp, has become a home to some 43,000 people, some of whom have lived here seven years. The Thais are reportedly pressuring many of them to go back to Laos.


While many of the Hmong were at one time looking forward to beginning a new life in the United States or some other Western nation, they are now hearing from hmong refugees in America that resettlement there can be traumatic. Thus, many now prefer to stay here.


The younger Hmong, according to Crossette, are also being pressured by their own military leaders to stay in Thailand and prepare for a guerrilla war against the communists in Laos.


Family ties also prevent many Hmong from migrating to other lands. When a French team recently came trying to recruit 80 settlers for French Guiana, only about 30 took up the offer.

MADISON -- Two hundred Chinese are currently studying and conducting research at the University of Wisconsin in an educational program that could lead to world peace and understanding, noted university chancellor Irving Shain in a Los Angeles Times report.


The number of Chinese scholars at the school is the largest at any educational institution in the U.S. There are also 353 students from Taiwan 271 from Hong Kong and 247 South Koreans at the university.


""I'm convinced that road to world stability and peace involves knowing as much as you can on a person-to-person basis about people from other countries and other cultures,"" Shain said.


""I think it's important for the Chinese to know as much about the United States as possible, and for us to know as much about China as possible. One way to do that is to bring Chinese to Madison and let them see what we're all about.


""We hope the leaders of China 20 years from now will have had their training at Madison,"" he added.


Shain noted that the exchange program, which began in 1979, has had a significant impact on the university and the city.


""There has been a tremendous increase in interest in China and the Chinese culture. When we started...there were only four or five Chinese restaurants in Madison, but at last count somebody told me there were 22 -- and some of them are pretty good.""


Although a few scholars are supported privately, the Chinese government pays for the expenses of most of them. UW covers the travel expenses of its professors when they go to China, and their host country pays their expenses there and research costs in return for their teaching.


Shain noted that a minor problem with the program was the differences in subject interest of the two countries. The Chinese come here to study science, technology, engineering, agriculture and medicine, while most of the American professors who travel to China are social scientists more interested in Chinese culture and politics.


""Sometimes the match-up isn't very easy,"" Shain said. ""They want engineers to go over there to teach short courses. They don't want social scientists.""


However, he believed that the university is gaining much from the exchange program.


""We're learning a lot about China. Our faculty are getting opportunities to do research in China that are just not available to other people.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- When one thinks of fashion, one pictures the glamorous models, the fussy tailors with pins clamped between their teeth as they make emergency hemline adjustments, and the esoteric designers who deign to tell us mortals what we should and should not wear.


But few actually see the nuts-and-bolts work behind the scenes which actually brings the fashions to the general public.


Irene Chen, who herself looks like a model, is the fashion coordinator of the Missy Department of Macy's 22 stores in California.


Chen was born in Shanghai and lived in Hong Kong until her senior year in high school. She then came to the U.S. and continued her education here. She attended San Jose State University, where she obtained her degree in Interior Design.


After graduation she joined Liberty House as the assistant manager of the Better Sportswear wear Department, and later joined Mark Fenwick Boutique and became its store manager.


When better opportunities came along, Chen joined Macy's as a sale manager. She went on to be assistant buyer, then regional fashion coordinator, and finally her present position.


As fashion coordinator of the Missy Department, Chen supervises three divisions within the store: Better Dresses, Club House (career oriented dresses), and Sportswear. The Missy Department also has 18 to 20 buyers whom Chen trains for seasonal buying.


Chen also works with a photo stylist on daily newspaper advertisements and on the Macy's catalogue, and is involved with designs for window displays, for the highlight display areas in the store as well as fashion shows.


Besides the load of in-store activities, Chen makes buying trips to the fashion capitals of the world three times a year.


All this sounds glamourous and exciting, but Irene Chen knows better.


""I love what I am doing,"" she said, ""and this is what makes my work interesting. Sure, there is some glitter associated with my type of work, but there is a lot of hard work, too.


""People often fantasize my role as a Fashion Coordinator as being glamourous and fun, but I would say that in my position, I only create fantasies for other people, but I do not have any delusions as to how hard I have to work,"" Chen said.


Just putting on a fashion show, for instance, is exhausting work. A fashion show means creating an overall image through staging, music, lighting and suitable models. Colors and designs of clothing, plus accessories must be coordinated to make the image; and in order for me to do this, I have to pull clothes off the racks, and select the proper shoes and accessories for each model. All this is time-consuming work, especially when there are dozens of outfits to be modeled, plus coordinating all the different components of the show,"" she said.


""As for my travels to New York, Paris, Milan and London -- most of my tme is devoted to work there, but I do try to balance work with pleasurable activities. I try to attend the latest and 'hottest' shows around and I enjoy entertaining moments with friends and colleagues.


""During the day, however, much of my time is spent attending designers' shows and fashion show previews,"" she said.


""We spend two to three weeks in Europe and we make appointments to see three to five showrooms a day. However, when we go to New York, we make appointments to see 10-15 showrooms a day. In Europe, we are dependent on interpreters to help us so our pace is much slower.""


Chen also spends time buying samples from local boutiques. Many of these are brought back to Macy's to be used as inspiration for new creations by their own designers.


When Chen tours local boutiques in the cities she visits, she looks for the latest concepts in merchandising presentations and she gleans new ideas for displays in the store.


""Dresses become the fashion phenomenon this season, featured by every designer and part of all sportswear collections."" Chen also said the Japanese influence on fashion will continue this year, though with a less bohemian look, and a ""much cleaner silhouette.""

PASADENA -- Dr. Taylor G. Wang is expected to become the first Chinese American to fly a space mission.


Dr. Wang, 44, is tentatively scheduled to serve as the space shuttle payload specialist for Spacelab 3 this November. However, a spokesman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here told Asian Week that the schedule for the mission has not become official yet.


Dr. Wang was born in Shanghai, China, and later moved to Taipei. He obtained a Ph.D. in physics at UCLA in 1971, and became a U.S. citizen in 1975. He and his wife Beverly live with their two teenaged sons in Glendale.


At a recent speech before a Chinese audience at Caltech, Dr. Wang noted that he is seven pounds overweight, according to NASA specifications. ""That's my wife's fault -- her home cooking is so good, especially her lamb!"" An audience member then asked jokingly whether he would be taking any lamb along on the space shuttle, and he said he is only allowed to take family pictures.


Another audience member pointed out that Dr. Wang will be the first Chinese to get close to the Moon Goddess. Will he get to meet her? ""First let me check with my wife,"" he joked.


If the flight takes off according to schedule, Dr. Wang will study the behavior of drops of liquid in zero-gravity in his experiment, called the Drop Dynamics Module.


Another Asian American, Dr. Eugene H. Trinh is Dr. Wang's alternate for the mission. A JPL. spokesman said that Dr. Trinh will fly a similar mission sometime in the future.

""Sixteen Candles,"" a recently released movie playing in theaters nationwide, is an innocent enough story of the trauma a teenager goes through as she turns ""Sweet Sixteen.""


Critics have hailed this film as ""A sure fire hit,"" ""This year's 'Risky Business,'"" ""Funny and Entertaining."" Even the little man in the Chronicle's Pink section is clapping. The Chronicle critic calls the film ""funny"" and ""dreamy.""


I agree that this is an okay movie; there's no violence, nothing really vulgar happens -- you could take your kids to see it.


But one character, a Chinese exchange student named ""Long Duk Dong"" spoiled this film for me. ""Long Duk"" is one of the worst stereotypes of an Asian I have ever seen in film. His character is never developed; he is used strictly for cheap laughs.


The film is set in a typical American middle-class town with a typical white American family. There's mom and dad, the whining little sister, the pretty older sister, the sister who just turned 16, and the bratty little brother. We also meet, both sets of grandparents, who are in town for the pretty older sister's wedding.


Finding her grandparents in her room, Samantha, the 16-year-old main character, goes into the bratty brother's room and sits on the bunk bed. And then we hear:


""GONG!"" It's your typical garbage can lid sounding gong, supposedly symbolic of the Orient. But in this film, the gong is used over and over whenever Long Duk Dong appears.


""Whas happening hotstuff,"" Long Duk says to the girl in a heavy Chinese accent. He is lying on the top bunk looking at her upside down.


Samantha goes downstairs to her mom and says that there's a weird Chinese guy upstairs. He's an exchange student, the mom says. ""Grandpa and grandma brought him.""


Samantha complains that she was kicked out of her room. But the bratty brother says. ""At least you don't have to sleep under a Chinaman.""


""GONG!""


Long Duk Dong is sitting at the dinner table as the whole family watches him, trying to hold back their laughter. This is the first close-up we get of Long Duk. He's a stereotypical F.O.B.: short, greasy hair parted in the middle, funky clothes; the only thing missing are the coke-bottle glasses.


""This is a very interesting dinner,"" Long Duk says as he tries to eat his quiche.


The family laughs at him.


The audience at the theater laughed at the family laughing at him.


""This is a joke,"" I said to myself.


Unfortunately, there is more.


Long Duk, a small Asian, is at a high school dance dancing head to chest with a big-busted girl. I think you could figure out this ""eye-opening"" situation.


""GONG!""


Long Duk is shown driving madly through the streets after the dance. He is with the same girl and says, ""I've never been so happy in my foreign life."" Then he crashes into a compact car.


After Long Duk gets drunk at a party, he is shown laughing crazily on a tree. Dressed as a Samurai, he yells ""Banzai!"" and jumps off.


And the final insult comes when we find Long Duk flat on his face by the tree in the morning. He was there all night. A dog comes by and licks his face.


The family, on their way to the sister's wedding, sees him. They seem concerned and ask if he needs help. Then the grandpa asks what happened to his car.


Long Duk says he crashed it. The mild-mannered granny suddenly becomes upset, calls him a ""scuzbag"" and then kicks him where no guy wants to be kicked. A sad scene.


Long Duk never evolves as a human being. We never learn anything about him. It's one stereotype after another. And the audience, mostly teens, loved it. That's the sad part.


It is this type of character that we, as Asian Americans, do not need, especially in a major motion picture. The dominant society will see Long Duk and look at Asian Americans, and think we're all the same.


Teenagers, who can be cruel, often believe what they see. Many don't know better. Just look at Homestead High School.


Universal Studios is responsible for this film. It is written and directed by John Hughes.


And an actor named Gedde Watanabe plays Long Duk Dong. I wonder if Gedde has any pride left. I know actors have to make a living, but what he did was demeaning. It was a slap in the face to every Asian community.


The critics should also be criticized. Only once have I seen the stereotype mentioned in a review. They probably laughed at Long Duk like everyone else. Like . . . some critics don't know any better.


""We're never going to get rid of stereotypes if things like this keep coming out,"" a friend of mine who also saw the film said.


I don't know if it will make any difference, but I am sending a letter of protest to Universal Studios. One letter represents 2,000 people. I strongly urge you to write to:

SACRAMENTO -- State Superintendent Bill Honig met with Young Choon Kim, Education Attache for the Republic of Korea on Thursday, Oct. 11.


Kim is visiting California in order to promote educational ties between California and the Republic of Korea. Of the estimated 550,000 Korean Americans in the U.S., more than 150,000 reside in California. The state's schools currently enroll nearly 21,000 students who have a Korean language background.


While in California Kim also met with Senator Leroy F. Greene on Oct. 11, and on Oct. 12-13 Kim participated in the Second Annual Conference on Korean American Education in Pasadena. The conference was organized in order to establish a better understanding of the social and educational needs of Korean Americans in California. Organized by the Korean American Educators Association with the assistance of the Department of Education, this conference is the only statewide activity in the nation which addresses the needs of Korean American students.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Two years of planning and anticipation came to a happy conclusion this week as a representative of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development delivered a copy of a check for $3,637,282 for construction of an 11-story, 70-unit apartment building to provide housing for the elderly in Chinatown.


Mayor Dianne Feinstein hailed the efforts of Chinatown activists in securing the loan, and publicly thanked Republican Senator Pete Wilson for his assistance in the matter. (See Asian Week, 9/28/84.)


Anni Chung, executive director of Self-Help for the Elderly, the organization sponsoring the project, thanked a wide range of volunteers and officials for their assistance in obtaining the federal loan.


Feinstein gave particular praise to Chung, who she said was on of the principal moving forces behind the project.


""Anni is like a sweet dragon lady,"" Feinstein said before a crowd of nearly 200 at Self-Help last Monday. ""She knows where she wants to go, what she wants to do and what needs to be done to accomplish her goals.""


Turning to Scott Hart, an aide to Sen. Wilson, Feinstein suggested more such federal grants should be offered by the Reagan administration. ""If you follow this one with some others it would be wonderful.


With the presidential election less than a month away, Hart denied that the timing of the loan announcement was politically motivated.


Henry Wong of HUD's Housing programs office in San Francisco confirmed that such loans for housing projects are announced every year at the end of September, and that no consideration was given to this year's presidential election. Community leaders present at the ceremony Monday seemed unconcerned about the motivation behind the loan.


""No matter which way you look at it, Chinatown is getting 70 more units than it had before,"" said attorney Gordon Lau.


Feinstein said the HUD senior housing loans are ""few and far between,"" and added that she would like to see more such loans coming to the City.

The Washington State Asian American Elected Officials earlier this month honored Tomio Moriguchi, president of Uwajimaya, Inc., for his contributions in promoting cultural understanding and international trade and tourism with the Pacific Rim.


The October 3 reception, held at the Madison Hotel in downtown Seattle, was co-sponsored by the Port of Seattle, the Boeing Company, Northwest Airlines, Pacific Northwest Bell, Touche Ross and Company, Rainier National Bank, SeaFirst Bank and Uwajimaya, Inc.


Also honored was the Pacific Science Center for its work in putting together the ""China: 7,000 Years of Discovery"" exhibit.


Moriguchi received a special plaque in front of a crowd of 200 foreign dignitaries, business representatives, educators, elected officials and Asian American community leaders.


Seattle City Council member Dolores Sibonga, in comments to the gathering, noted Moriguchi's community involvement in the International District. She said that Moriguchi, as a businessman, ""has also promoted our links with the Pacific Rim.""


A recent survey showed, she said, that Asian businesses consider ""the understanding of culture and language"" significant factors in deciding where to locate and invest. ""Seattle is fortunate to have a large Pacific Asian community that can help bridge cultural and language differences,"" Sibonga said.


King County Council member Ruby Chow, a member of the Council's Economic Development and Intergovernmental Relations Committee, said, ""I am glad to see so many local public officials taking an active interest in international trade.""


Sibonga said that, in the past, international trade issues have been the responsibility of state and federal jurisdictions. ""Today,"" she said, ""we all recognize the interdependence of our world economy and the importance of maximizing cities' abilities to take advantage of the economic potential.


""More importantly, in the end, an expanded revenue base provides us with the money to fund our social service programs, repair our streets and take care of our citizens.""


Ruthann Kurose, international trade coordinator for the City of Seattle, commented toward the end of the evening that the City ""has taken a series of actions to highlight a role of utilizing trade and tourism as an effective economic development tool to bolster our economy.""


Kurose pointed out that she and Sibonga attended a trade conference hosted by Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. ""His strategy,"" Kurose said, ""is to establish strong economic trade links with various Caribbean and African nations by emphasizing cultural sensitivity and understanding. I believe this principle is very applicable to our situation.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Geraldine Ferraro praised Secretary of State March Fong Eu for her prowess at the ballot box Wednesday in an address before the Asian Pacific Caucus, apparently in an attempt to defuse caucus members' anger and the threat of a boycott of the first ballot vote for the Democratic nomination that night.


In what had come to be known as ""Mondale's convention,"" Eu was not invited to address the convention from the podium. Caucus Chairman Thomas Hsieh at one point threatened to lead a picket line outside the hall if Eu was not scheduled to deliver a major address. Some of the more forceful Asian Pacific delegates were threatening to join the Hispanic boycott of the first ballot, which would also serve to register strong protest over the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill.


Ferraro's appearance before the caucus was apparently intended to placate Asian Pacific delegates sympathetic to the Simpson-Mazzoli boycott.


Ferraro insured an enthusiastic response by giving praise to Congressmen Norm Mineta and Bob Matsui, and especially to Eu, who is the top female votegetter in the country.


""We do have women votegetters -- particularly in this state. We have Secretary of State March Fong Eu,"" Ferraro said to a sudden burst of applause from the packed meeting room at the Hilton Hotel.


Eu joined the New York congresswoman onstage, and the pair received a standing ovation.


Earlier, Ferraro spoke glowingly of Mineta and Bob Matsul. ""I will miss my colleagues in the House. Bob Matsui and I were first elected at the same time, and we went through all the aches and pains of getting our committee assignments together, and getting to know our colleagues, and getting to know where the committee rooms were.


""And of course Norm is my chairman, Very bossy,"" she said, drawing laughter. ""But he's excellent. With all the things Norm has done for this country, we should all be proud of him.""


Ferraro praised Asian Pacific Americans for their rapid rise within the Democratic Party.


""I asked Tom Hsieh how many delegates you have this year, and he said 103. I asked how many you had in 1980, and he said three. Now isn't it wonderful that all of us are participating this time?""


Ferraro, who chaired the Platform Committee for the party, credited the Asian Pacific Caucus and Hsieh for their hard work to get planks of the caucus platform adopted by the national party.


""Redress, bilingual education, immigration, all the issues you're especially concerned with are addressed on the platform,"" she declared.


Matsui gave a joking endorsement of Ferraro's qualifications. ""She's more experienced than Spiro Agnew, and twice as smart as George Bush,"" he said. But more importantly she has opened the door not only for women but for all of us.""


Mineta pointed out that the congresswoman was a ""child of an immigrant family, and she knows of the special problems that entails. Her leadership on the Platform Committee is responsible"" for the inclusion of Asian Pacific planks being included, he said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The tenants of 1000 Montgomery Street and their attorneys announced completion of a settlement agreement with the new owners of their much-fought-over North Beach apartment building. That agreement requires the owners, 1000 Montgomery Associates, to pay the tenants a total of $225,000 over three years. For their part, the tenants agree to voluntarily leave the building and drop all lawsuits against the owners and The City that sought to prevent the conversion of the building from low-income housing to offices.


The owners of the property have been attempting to convert the 17 units of affordable housing to legal and professional offices for over three years. The tenants, supported by a citywide coalition of neighborhood and housing organizations, have opposed the conversion plan from the outset on the grounds that it would directly displace them and their families and would further reduce Chinatown's and North Beach's supply of affordable housing.


After almost half a dozen public hearings before various city agencies over the course of a year, The City reluctantly granted a permit to convert on the basis that the law did not give them the power to refuse the permit. It was at that point that attorneys representing the tenants filed a number of lawsuits to stop conversion.


Most tenants said they would have preferred to remain in the apartments that some have called home for 20-30 years but felt that the proposed settlement of $20,000 per household, 10 times the $2,000 originally offered by the owners, combined with an end to the stress and uncertainty they have had to live under for the past three years, made the offer acceptable.


""If we had continued our lawsuits we might have won everything,"" explained Mrs. Cruz Luna, ""but there is just as much chance we could have lost everything too."" Tenant attorneys Tim Lee of the San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Aid Foundation and Steve Schectman of West Bay Law Collective also pointed out that the owners must provide 17 replacement units in the city at comparable rents before they can receive an occupancy permit for the renovated offices.


The owner/developers seem to welcome the chance to put an end to years of public hearings, demonstrations, litigation and media attention. Partner Richard Mitchell stated, ""We are happy to have reached an agreement that satisfies the tenants needs and allows us to proceed with our project.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Chinese American Democratic Club has endorsed challenger Pat Norman for San Francisco Supervisor in the Nov 6 municipal election.


Norman, a progressive Democrat and civil rights activist, said she regards the CADC endorsement as an important one in her bid for office. ""The Chinese American Democratic Club has had a healthy influence on San Francisco politics for many years,"" she said, ""and I welcome its support.""


The influential club addresses the interests of not only Chinese Americans, but of other Asian Americans and the population of the city as a whole -- addressing such issues as housing, unemployment and development.


The CADC joins other organizations in its endorsement of Norman, including recent endorsements by the San Francisco Chapter of the National Organization for Women (Political Action Committee). San Franciscan Democratic Club, the Harvey Milk Lesbian & Gay Democratic Club, and the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian/Gay Democratic Club.

Curtis Choy, a second-generation San Franciscan, became involved in the ten-year struggle to save the International Hotel in Manilatown--and film that struggle--in the early 1970s.


Now nothing remains of the I-Hotel but a hole in the ground on its site -- and Choy's imaginative documentary, which will be shown at a benefit at San Francisco's Victoria Theatre, Thursday, March 1.


Choy ""began hanging out"" at the hotel when he learned of the situation in his ethnic studies classes at San Francisco State, where he was also studying filmmaking. It took him six years to make ""The Fall of the I-Hotel,"" because of the ""financial problems, writer's block and its film-editing equivalent. It was a very complex story, focusing on the elderly (the 50 Manongs, long-time residents there), housing issues and the gentrification of the City.""


""Gentrification,"" he maintains, is ""a problem throughout the world's major cities--the driving out of long-established lower class people"" from neighborhoods to create expensive housing and posh ""Union Streets.""


San Francisco's Manilatown, Choy says, ""was part of the history of being a Filipino in America."" In the neighborhood were also such organizations as Asian Legal Services, the Kearny Street Workshop, the Jackson Gallery and the original Mabuhay restuarant.


Now nothing remains of this one-time community of 10,000 Filipinos. The hotel provided housing for international seamen, farm workers, cannery workers, houseboys and single working men.


But the encroachment of business and commercial property from downtown did much to destroy its surrounding community, and by 1968 all that remained was the I-Hotel. After an almost 10-year-struggle, that went too, with the forced removal in 1968 of 50 Filipino oldsters and others in the predawn by over 300 of San Francisco's finest--police and other ""law enforcement"" officials. The Four Seas Corporation had triumphed.


Choy was highly complimented when someone said of his 57-minute documentary in color and black and white: ""It captures the feeling of an epoch--the activism of the '70s."" He found ""The Big Chill"" ""not so real."" Added Choy: ""A couple of people have said of my film that it gives them the spirit to continue.""


""The Fall of the I-Hotel"" uses poetry, animation and rare newsreel footage, as well as interviews with residents, community workers and politicians. It climaxes with the mass eviction and the huge demonstrations that followed.


As a filmmaker, Choy says, ""I don't like doing things the way everybody does them."" For example, he has done interviews without the faces of interviewees on camera.


He is taken by French filmmaker Godard, whom he says ""is always pushing to the limit. But art should not be so obscure that people don't get it. Some personal filmmakers are so personal that their work should never be shown.""


Choy made his first films in a Fremont High School, (Oakland) crafts class. Among them was ""Family Life Serious,"" a spoof on the family life series, ""one of those 'how not to get pregnant' high school offerings."" Choys was done with ""animated pipe cleaners"" and a hero named Sammy the Sperm. His second was a political film, ""The Turn of the Hitleresque Screw,"" about the authoritarian elements of high school: ""the teacher-student relationships, the history classes on the Vietnam war.""


Only after getting involved in ethnic studies at S.F. State did he have his introduction to Chinatown, and then he made his ""first real film,"" ""Dupont Guy: The Schiz of Grant Avenue,"" an ""essay"" on growing up Chinese American, based on ""real interviews with real people, who do not necessarily appear.""


In 1976 he made ""Wendy--Uh--What's Her Name,"" about Wendy Yoshimura, the woman who was caught with Patricia Hearst, and imprisoned for supposedly having explosives in her garage. ""The case was stacked,"" Choy maintains. ""She's just an artist,"" into printmaking before ""she got nailed."" Choy made his half-hour film in two months, hoping to aid the fundraising for her defense, but timewise that didn't work out.


More recently he worked as sound recordist and video engineer on ""The Gospel in Guatemala,"" about the fundamentalist right-wing political leader of that country, co-produced by Steve Talbot and Elizabeth Farnsworth for KQED in 1982.


He's also been sound mixer for Wayne Wang's ""Chan is Missing"" and the soon-to-be-released ""Dim Sum.""


Choy wrote, produced, directed and edited ""The Fall of the I-Hotel."" What's his current project? ""To promote the film, make it available to housing groups, groups for the elderly. It ought to serve their needs.""


""The Fall of the I-Hotel"" will be shown Thursday, March 1, 7:30 and 9:15 p.m. at the Victoria Theatre, 16th Street between Capp and Mission, San Francisco. It is sponsored by Chonk Moonhunter Productions, the National Asian American Telecommunications Assn. and the Kearny Street Workshop. All proceeds will help reduce production debts. Ticket information: (415) 392-4400; general information (415) 444-3074.

SAN FRANCISCO -- She started trying to bridge East and West 12 years ago when President Nixon and Henry Kissinger visited the People's Republic of China. And she is trying to bring the two worlds together through music still today.


Zhang Yan, who gave performances for Nixon when he made the historic visit which ended the 23-year era of cold relations between the U.S. and P.R.C., has been acclaimed at concerts here for her mastery of the zheng, or Chinese harp, as well as her ability to adapt the instrument to Western music. ""I played some Beatles music at a concert last January,"" she said excitedly. ""And I got to play an electric piano there, also. I've never gotten to play one before!""


This is Zhang's second trip to the U.S. She came in 1978, strictly for a musical tour. This time she came to meet and visit with her grandparents in Denver, and also to learn more about Western music and instruments.


""I'm anxious to get together with an American orchestra,"" she said.


And she may get her chance. A friend of hers, Kent Nagano is a director with both the Berkeley and Oakland symphonies, and he has expressed interest in having her play.


It would not be her debut in the East Bay, however, Zhang recently got rave reviews in the Contra Costa Sun for her concert with the Symphony of the Mountain in Moraga last month, at which she played works by Gershwin, Bernstein and Barberr.


Zhang does not have a hard time picking up new styles to music; she studied at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music for 17 years. She has visited more than 20 countries, learning of the instruments and styles in each place and performing the music of China for those who have not heard it before.


Heads of state have heard solo performances by Zhang. Among her most notable audience members have been the President of Pakistan, the President of Algeria, President Joao Bernardo Vieira of Guinea-Bissau, President Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela, Imelda Marcos of the Philippines, the Premier of Burma, President Didier Ratsiraka of Madagascar, President Mathieu Kerekou of Benin and President Mzee Jome Kenyatta of Kenya.


""I think people in the United States would appreciate Chinese music,"" she told Asian Week. ""And I would like to stay here long enough to learn more of American music. I think we can bring the two styles together.""

OAKLAND -- The City Council voted Tuesday to block Asian Holdings, Inc. from further development of a three-block area around its Trans Pacific Centre in Oakland Chinatown.


The council was upset because Yap Lim Sen, owner of Dragon Base and Darton Ltd., two companies which took over Asian Holdings' estimated $76 million U.S. properties, refused to divulge information of his personal finances, according to Lonnie Isabel of the Oakland Tribune.


Asian Holdings will maintain ownership of the six-story office building and garage it built at the Trans Pacific Centre.


Dragon Base/Darton took over Asian Holdings last year after the latter's parent company, Carrian Investments Group, collapsed amid scandal in Hong Kong. George Tan, principal owner of Carrian, was arrested in Hong Kong for fraud and is currently out on bail, Isabel reported.


Though the city of Oakland considers redevelopment of the area around Trans Pacific Centre essential to its plans for modernization of the downtown area, Chinatown residents have long been skeptical of the developers and have expressed concern that new developments should not endanger Chinatown as a residential neighborhood.


Last August Asian Holdings submitted proposals for three office buildings, a hotel and a commercial-and-residential building on the land adjacent to the center. Cost of construction for the projects was estimated at $206 million.


But members of the City Council suspected the new owners of Asian Holdings were closely related to the same interests who had arranged financing for the company's earlier projects. The council demanded financial statements from the developers to show clearly where the capital for the projects would come from.


The developers contended that the request for Yap's personal financial statement has irrelevant to the project and represented an ""unreasonable intrusion into his personal affairs,"" Isabel reported.


Tuesday's action was the first time Oakland has ousted a major developer since it launched its ambitious redevelopment campaign in the late 1960s.

Recent beatings, stabbings and house burnings confirm that violence against Asian Americans is on the rise. These incidents are not an isolated problem of the Asian American community, indeed they threaten to smother the great American dream of liberty and justice for all. Our country is nourished on the truth that every person regardless of race, color or religious persuasion has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. However, it appears that a growing number of people wish to keep this great dream away from those Americans who came to this country over the Pacific Ocean rather than the Atlantic. But freedom is not for the few, it is for the many. And for the sake of our country's freedom, we must protect the freedom of each individual.


The most puzzling part of anti-Asian American violence is the rationale given for its practice -- patriotism. Somehow it is thought that harassing Asian Americans is patriotic. As if beating up an Asian is equivalent to waving the flag.


It is not.


Acts of racism have absolutely nothing to do with baseball, hot dogs and apple pie. Denying parking spaces to Japanese-made automobile cannot be equated with protecting our borders from enemy attack. Fire-bombing Laotian refugee homes should not be confused with bombing of enemy territory. Can you explain how these acts are patriotic?


Who can explain this patriotism to the fiancee of the young Detroit man, Vincent Chin, who was brutally beaten to death by two auto workers who blamed Chin for their unemployment? Chin, a Chinese American, was celebrating his upcoming wedding at a Detroit bar when be was confronted by the auto workers who thought Chin was Japanese. The two men stalked Chin over a five-block area, and when they found him they beat him to death with a baseball bat.


Who can explain this patriotism to the wife of the Laotian refugee who was killed by two St. Louis motorists angered by the refugee's stalled car?


Who can explain this patriotism to the nearly 60 Asian refugees in Boston who were driven from their homes by a series of suspicious fires?


Who can explain this patriotism to Keo Sopheap, a 19-year-old Cambodian refugee, who is ridiculed by his fellow high school students who tell him to return to Cambodia?


Who can explain this patriotism to the Cambodian family forced to move from their home because their neighbors throw rocks through their windows, one of which hit their baby in the head?


And who can explain this patriotism to the husband of Ly Yung Cheung, a seamstress in New York's Chinatown, who was pushed into the path of an onrushing subway train? Cheung was waiting for the train when a man came up and pushed her into the path of the train which decapitated her. It was reported that the man shouted, ""We're even"" after pushing Cheung. Defense attorney for the accused man claims that his client has a ""psychotic phobia about Orientals.""


The truth of the matter is that none of these actions can be construed in any way with patriotism.


Racism is unpatriotic and un-American.


As we plan for the future of our country and of Asian American participation, there are two trends that should be carefully watched. First, violence against Asian Americans is on the rise. Statistics show that anti-Asian violence increased by 26 percent last year. This dramatic rise has promoted the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to conduct a study of discrimination against Asian Americans, which reportedly will begin this year. Second, the Asian American population is growing very quickly. According to the U.S. Census Bureau our current Asian population is 3.5 million and will double by the year 2000. As the increase in population grows, so does the possibility for racial tension and racist behavior.


The American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is what makes America what it is today. It is a dream to be shared with all citizens of this country. We cannot allow greed and hatred to turn this dream into a nightmare. If we work together we can keep the dream alive.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Thirty-eight years ago, 61-year-old Wai Cheow Lam started his first day on the job at the Commercial Club at 465 Montgomery Street. He was joined five years later by Bob Woo, 59. With 29 years of service behind him, Louis K. Woo has been ""Married"" to his job longer than he has been to his wife.


These men represent the 56 cooks, waiters, bartenders and dishwashers currently on strike against the reputable business club, which is one of 15 such clubs holding a contract with Local 2, Hotel and Restaurant employees and Bartenders Union. About 40 of the workers at the Commercial Club are Asian.


While most of the major clubs such as the Pacific Union, the Bohemian, World Trade Engineers, Concordia and Town and Country have settled the contract dispute with Local 2, negotiations between the Commercial Club and union officials continue to be at an impasse.


Commercial Club management is calling for an 11 to 12 percent reduction in wages for waiters and bartenders, a one-year wage freeze for cooks and dishwashers, contributions of $121.38 a month from each of the majority of employees to maintain current benefits in the life of the contract, contributions of $27.57 a month from most employees toward pension, and a reduction in the shifts for cooks and dishwashers to four and six hours.


The union's final offer consists of a wage freeze in the first year, a wage reopener in the second year, maintenance of current benefits for the life of the contract; no increase in pension in the first two year $5 per month in the third year; eight-hour shifts for cooks and dishwashers.


Larry Tom, executive vice president for Local 2, noted that club management believes they can save about $54,000 per month in health and welfare benefits if their terms are met. Union officials are currently trying to bring management back to the bargaining table.


""It is unbelievable that after so many years, I have to strike at the two restaurants. I work at,"" lamented Commercial Club waiter Louie K. Woo, who is also a 26-year employee of Ernie's Restaurant. ""Never in my life has it happened before.""


""We all hope that there will be some agreement soon. I've been (at the Commercial Club) this long, I cannot say I don't like the job. I've worked here longer than I've been married to my wife.""


Woo, like other strikers, is getting $50 a week from the strike fund.


""(The club) raises their prices two to three times year,"" added Woo, ""but they want to cut down our wages. A couple of years ago, a cup of coffee used to be 45 cents, now it's 75 cents.""


""Since the strike, many of the regular members have stayed away,"" observed Bob Woo, who has worked at the club for 32 years. ""We all know them very well, and they are like family. We know what their favorite food is.""


Unlike other employees who spend most of their time at the picket line, Bob Woo works part-time at the Presidio Officer's Club.


The strikers are currently being replaced at the restaurant by white workers, who probably will not stay at the job long, the two employees feel.


""Many of them are young people, below 35, and I think they are temporary because there is no tipping there. The whites don't want these jobs.""


Alan Hong, affirmative action officer of Local 2, said that the union has met with members of the Asian community about the workers' plight, and has received support from all segments. The union has also approached Asian members of the club and asked for their support.


There are about 20 Asians in the 1,500-member club, including 19 Chinese and one Japanese.

In the middle of a February night in 1983, dozens of Southeast Asians at 434 Leavenworth St. in San Francisco's Tenderloin District were roused from sleep by the smell of smoke. Hurrying outside, they watched numbly as the entire building was wrapped in flame.


But like all major fires, this one brought a little comfort in the form of a Red Cross bus dispatched to the scene. The homeless were invited inside; blankets and slippers were handed out. Through interpreters, they were told that their immediate needs would be met -- food, clothing and shelter.


""When we brought the victims from the fire into the Red Cross building, normally we would get them coffee and donuts,"" recalled Peter Ashen director of Emergency Services. ""We quickly realized that we had primarily Asians. So we went down and got 100 pork bau and tea. I think that's symbolic of how the Red Cross is sensitive to cultural expectations.""


Eight families from the fire were taken to the Sam Wong Hotel on Broadway, near Grant Avenue in Chinatown. The hotel staff speak both Cantonese and Mandarin, and there are cooking facilities in the rooms. ""We have been doing this for almost 10 years,"" said Manny Wong, the hotel manager. ""They usually stay here for one to four weeks."" All expenses are paid by the Red Cross.


The language barrier seldom poses a problem during emergencies, according to Sue Smith of the Red Cross office at 1550 Sutter.


""Quite often at the fire scene, the children will speak good English. Also, we have a language bank -- a list of people and the languages they speak. Or we can call staff if necessary,"" Smith said.


The Asian staff members and volunteers enable the Red Cross to send roots deep into the community and provide information, training and social services to those of limited English proficiency.


Agnes Chan, a member of the State Board of Education, works at the Red Cross two days a week as the earthquake coordinator. One of her slide presentations on earthquake . . . measures. ""You Can't Say No to an Earthquake,"" has pre-recorded soundtracks in Cantonese and Mandarin. She has shown it in health centers, senior centers and schools throughout the Chinese community, answering questions afterward.


""We expect a lot of casualties in the Chinatown area, because all the buildings are brick or mortar,"" Chan pointed out. ""The streets are narrow, it's so densely populated that there's no place for the people to go for shelter: For 72 hours, there won't be any aid available.""


Three or four times a year, Self-Help for the Elderly sponsors a 10-week training program for home health aides. The Red Cross provides classrooms, hospital beds and teaching aids for the first phase of the program. Open free to persons age 45 and older, all classes are taught simultaneously in Chinese and English. Graduates are certified by the Red Cross and also by the California Department of Health. There is a long waiting list for the program, which boasts an employment rate of 100 percent of its graduates.


The Red Cross's family reunification program helps bring together families who have been separated by war or other extreme circumstances.


""We have a contract with the State Department to verify the true relationship between relatives and refugees in the camp,"" said case worker Catherine Hong, who helps reunite 150 to 200 families per year. Then there is the orderly departure program.


Explained Annie Chan of the office of volunteers. ""Vietnam has decided to let a number of their people out as immigrants. We help them to get all their paperwork done after the Vietnam government gives approval for them to leave.""


Once the refugees arrive, the case is handed over to one of the 11 voluntary agencies that work in cooperation with the Red Cross. The largest of these is the U.S. Catholic Conference. John Yarling, director of the group's Migration and Resettlement Office on Golden Gate Avenue, said that ""this year we expect to resettle between 500 and 550 people. About 90 percent or them are from Southeast Asia.""


Several Red Cross publications, such as first aid and disaster information, are available in Chinese. But perhaps the best example of the organization's involvement in the Chinese community is the Red Cross Youth for Chinatown Elderly. Started in 1972, the programs matches 45 Asian-born high school students each with an elderly person living alone, who speaks the same Asian language. Through weekly visits they get to know each other, and together learn to overcome the difficulties of adjusting to American life.


""Many of the students are very shy and withdrawn in the beginning. We try to provide an extended family, a warm environment, a community for the students and elderly to expand out into, to encourage them to reach out and take a chance in America,"" said Meg white, a longtime volunteer for the program.


Added program director Ann Lee: ""Some students don't understand the program at first, but later they do. They learn to love their parents more.""


The Red Cross has a shortage of bilingual volunteers. If you would like to help tutor English, learn to teach first aid, or assist with earthquake presentations, call Annie Chan at 776-1500.

OAKLAND -- The First Interstate Bank of California Foundation awarded a $5,000 grant to the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC) for development of a community meeting and multi-purpose room.


A non-profit community development organization, EBALDC was created in 1975 to serve low- and moderate-income Asians in the East Bay by creating affordable housing, facilitating business ownership and assisting in the preservation of Oakland Chinatown as a residential, commercial and cultural center.


EBALDC is the owner, manager and leasing agent for the Asian Resource Center, a three-story commercial structure which houses five social service agencies, an art gallery, retail and commercial agencies.


""The gift from the Foundation will help provide a much-needed community meeting room for the social service agencies housed in the Center and the many volunteer service agencies in the community,"" said Lynnette Lee, EBALDC's executive director.


During the check presentation to the Reverend Frank Mar, Board of Director, A.H. Kingman, Jr., executive vice president and head of Northern California administration for First Interstate Bank of California, stated, ""On behalf of the Foundation, we are proud to present this grant to an agency whose goal is to maximize the benefits and needs of the Asian community in the East Bay.""


Also representing the bank at the check presentation were Steven Herrick, manager of the Franklin-Webster Office, and Russell Sakaguchi, assistant vice president, Urban and Community Affairs.

Western Films


""Firestarter,"" the novel by horror author Stephen King, is in this writer's opinion his best book, mainly for its delightful child heroine, Charlie McGee, a sensitive, loving little girl with only one problem. She can start fires with a glance. Drew Barrymore, the wonderful little sister of ""E.T.,"" now older (9), is perfectly cast in the role, as is George C. Scott as a very peculiar assassin indeed.


The special effects are fiery, and the climax has an awful lot of them, but Drew is so believable -- the best kid actress around -- that you're with the film almost every minute. Art Carney is very good as a grandfatherly farmer type who believes in freedom, and ""the Shop,"" a sinister government scientific establishment, is not all that unbelievable. Sticks closely to King's book, with two exceptions: Scott, an American Indian in the story, has been de-ethnicized (perhaps from fear of repurcussions), and in the end Drew goes to reveal all to the New York Times, King had her heading for the Rolling Stone.


""Moscow on the Hudson"" is perhaps the most ethnic picture of all time: Hispanics, Blacks, a Russian hero, even a few Asians, virtually no WASPs. Robin Williams as a dissatisfied Russian jazz musician who defects in New York's Bloomingdales, is often very good indeed.

DETROIT -- The admitted killer of Vincent Chin was sentenced to 25 years in prison this week.


Ronald Ebens, 44, was ordered by U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs to undergo treatment for alcoholism as well for the June 1982 slaying of Chin, according to Associated Press. Eben's attorney said he will appeal the decision, and Ebens remains free on $20,000 bail.


Ebens's step-son Michael Nitz, who pleaded no contest to charges of his involvement in the baseball bat bludgeoning of Chin, was acquitted of violating Chin's civil rights.


Jim Shimoura, spokesman for American Citizens for Justice, the Asian American civil rights group which brought national attention to the case, said he hoped the sentence against Ebens would ""send a message"" that anti-Asian violence will be punished.


Helen Zia, president of ACJ, said she was satisfied with the sentence.


""Justice has run its course. We accept the verdict. But one fact remains -- Vincent Chin is dead,"" Zia said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Senator Alan Cranston of California remains the only Presidential candidate in either of the major parties to have put out a position paper specifically addressing issues of concern to the Asian American communities.


In a statement issued last October, Cranston deplored the rise in anti-Asian sentiments current in the United States. Noting the ""brutal, senseless slaying"" of Vincent Chin in Detroit by unemployed auto workers, Cranston said that ""in the fight for social justice for Asian Americans, we still have much more work to do.""


Cranston was also the first of the candidates to publicly support redress for Japanese Americans who were interned in concentration camps during World War II, and in fact authored a Senate resolution which endorsed the redress concept, though it did not specify a cash figure.


""I opposed the relocation of Japanese Americans from the very beginning. While working in the Office of War Information after Pearl Harbor, I joined closely with Eleanor Roosevelt, Archibald MacLeish and then-Attorney General Francis Biddle trying to dissuade President Roosevelt from issuing the relocation order,"" Cranston said.


In his position paper Cranston specifically promised to:


Ensure full participation by Asian Americans in federal programs regarding civil rights, equal opportunity in employment and business development;


Support educational programs -- including bilingual education -- designed to help Asian American students. He pointed out that in 1974 he co-authored bilingual education legislation with Sen. Edward Kennedy that ""became the backbone of federal bilingual education efforts"";


Implement employment and training programs that ensure a fair-share allocation of resources to Asian American communities;


Enact federal policies promoting the construction of low-and moderate-income housing in Asian American communities;


Continue efforts to implement fair and efficient immigration policies and encourage the reunification of families;


Enact guidelines for states to serve the special interests of Asian Americans in the areas of health and human services;


Promote self-help programs for Southeast Asian refugees to eliminate social and economic dependency, and adopt procedures to encourage their speedy resettlement in the U.S.; and


Monitor all federal statistical efforts to make sure accurate data on Asian Americans are compiled and reported regularly.


In addition, Cranston so far seems to be the only candidate with Asian American aides in highly visible positions. Jadine Nielsen, a third-generation Chinese American, serves as his top administrative aide at his district office in San Francisco. And Kam Kuwata serves as his deputy press secretary.

Despite the low number of Asian Americans seated as delegates and alternates to the Republican National Convention in Dallas, and the Republican Party's refusal to directly address Asian American issues to the degree that the Democrats did, the Reagan administration acknowledged the importance of Asian Americans by sending Vice President George Bush to campaign in San Francisco Chinatown, the symbolic ""capital city"" of Asian America.


Asian American Republicans are now organizing an Asian Pacific Caucus for their party, which they hope will be firmly entrenched before the next election.


Anna Chennault chairwoman for the party's outreach effort to Asian Americans, fought hard for treatment of Asian Pacific Americans equal to that given to blacks and Hispanics within the party. Her fierce demands were one of the most newsworthy items of an otherwise well-orchestrated, rehearsed (""boring"" was the description used by many reporters) convention.


In his visit to Chinatown last October, Bush praised Asian Americans for their ""strong belief in faith, family and hard work,"" noting that these were the ideals the Republican Party was attempting to bring back to Middle America.

With the successful conclusion of the World Olympiad in Los Angeles, it is well to note that at one time in San Francisco Chinatown, participation in American sports was not so popular. In the early 1920s a group of Chinese Americans introduced tennis and golf to the youth of the community instead of kung-fu, and produced such luminaries as Charles S. Lee, Billy Louie, Tommy China and Walter Mun-Fay Wong. The ""307"" Club on Commercial St. brought tennis to Chinatown before the Chinese Tennis Club, Walter M.F. Wong was an early player in tennis and golf and won Championship trophies from the ""307"" Club.


Walt Wong never went to school with the kids of Chinatown who attended the Oriental School (now Commodore Stockton) or Francisco Middle School. He went to the Henry Durant Grammar School, Hamilton Junior High, which at that time was located in the Benjamin Franklin Middle School and the Lowell High School. He graduated from St. Mary's College in Moraga with an A.B. degree in 1934, and received his Doctor of Dental Surgery in 1940 at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, which was amalgamated with the University of the Pacific at Stockton in 1962. Dr. Wong went into private practice and also taught at the Dental School 1949-1982. He is the Curator of the Dental School Museum from 1974 to date, and will celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Museum.


Like many from his generation Dr. Wong served in World War II and retired from the U.S. Air Force as a Major. While overseas he served in Kunming, China in the China-Burma-India Theater with General Chennault in the 14th Air Force. He practiced dentistry in Capitola as early as 1946. Up to this point of time Dr. Wong was no different from any of his compatriots of the WWII veterans. He got married, raised a family and settled down to practice his profession.


However, the difference between Walt Wong from many of his contemparies, he chose Capitola to practice dentistry, while serving as an instructor at the old C.P.S. Dental School. He joined the Pasatiemo Golf Club of Santa Cruz and was able to get the Chinese American golfers a recognized ""golf handicap."" It placed the Chinese Golf Club of San Francisco on a par with the American golfer. Not being a golfer, I asked Walt Wong for the significance of this golf handicap. This was long before the civil rights, days, and any step toward equality was important whether in sports or social and professional life.


In his civic life, Walt Wong was elected the President of the Capitola Kiwanis Club, and Master of the Soquel Masonle Lodge #746 in 1969, a member of the Shrine, Knights of Templars and the Scottish Rites in 1957.


Dr. Wong, in my opinion, was not a fiery ""soap box orator"" in his young days; but in schooling, sports, civic and fraternal life, he is a ""role model"" and broke racial barriers for the new generations of American-born, newly arrived immigrants or recently naturalized citizens.


As a grade school student he did not attend a segregated public school, he practiced Dentistry in Capitola instead of San Francisco, participated in social, civic, veteran and fraternal activities in an American community. As professor Emeritus and now a Curator in the School of Dentistry Museum, he counsels young men and women in his profession. Future dental surgeons can find him at the museum of the U.O.P. Dental School.

MANILA -- After a widely publicized announcement that Imelda Marcos, wife of President Ferdinad Marcos, would resign all her governmental posts, she has been reappointed to her position in the Cabinet.


President Marcos said on Saturday, June 30 that his wife would retain her position as Minister of Human Settlements, according to the Washington Post. That would at least leave Mrs. Marcos in a position to wield influence in the event of her husband's death.


In fact, the Post reported, President Marcos retained 22 of his previous 27 cabinet members. The most notable change was the appointment of Arturo Tolentino as Foreign Minister. Tolentino is reputed to be something of a maverick in his independence of Marcos.


Acting Foreign Minister Manuel Collantes, apparently embittered about losing his post, said he was joining a group of 30 assemblymen pressing for a review of the president's controversial power to legislate by decree.

WASHINGTON -- Senator Pete Wilson recently announced a $1 million loan has been approved by the federal government to help members of the San Francisco Asian community build a Mission District small business project.


Approved by the federal Housing and Urban Development department was a loan from the Urban Development Action Grant program to help the Rede Investment Corp. and Asian, Inc., both of San Francisco put the project together at 1901 Bryant St.


The partnership proposes to acquire an existing building and reconstruct 150,000 square feet of space to sell on a condominium basis to small businesses for light manufacturing and office uses.


The total project will cost $9 million, and over $5.6 million of the amount is from private sources. The project also has support of the City of San Francisco and the Ford Foundation.


An estimated 195 permanent jobs will be caused by the project as well as 160 one-time construction jobs.


The UDAG funds are considered essential to the project to ""meet the goals of reducing sales prices to small minority businesses,"" said the proponents of the effort.


In urging approval of the loan, Wilson said it is the kind of ""public-private partnership"" which is needed to stimulate jobs and development in the minority community.


""We have here a case where the business community is putting up considerable funds to help the cause of the community, and all it is seeking is a helping hand from the government instead of the government leading the way,"" Wilson said. ""This is the way to urban revitalization and job development in my book.""

BEIJING -- After an eight-year legal battle, a Beijing social welfare worker has won a $100 million inheritance in a Japanese court, reported the New China News Agency.


It said the extraordinary tale about the gold, jewels and real estate of a former senior Chinese official in Japan's wartime puppet state of Manchuko drew more than 70 claims from people who claimed to the dead man's wife and children.


Workers in China earn about $300 a year.


The amassed fortune belonged to Zhao Xinbo, president of the Manchuko parliament of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his wife, Zhao Biyan, went to Japan in 1938 and left their wealth in the charge of a Japanese lawyer when they returned to China in 1943.


Zhao died in 1951, following the Chinese revolution, and his legal counsel died a little while later. It was then that people from Macao, Taiwan, Malaysia and Japan began to claim themselves as heirs.


Three women said that they were Zhao's widow, while one man, on learning that the Zhaos' son, Zhao Zongyang, was blind in one eye, took out his own eye to claim the money.


In 1976 Zhao Zongyang joined in the fight for the inheritance and won the money in September.


A Beijing social worker with four children, Zhao Zongyang, 59, stands to inherit the $100 million from his 84-year-old mother.


It is rumored that China plans to make a film about the unusual circumstances surrounding the wealth of Zhao Xinbo.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Asian Americans' contributions to the United States and the important role they play in politics, the economy and the culture of the country received official recognition by the administration of President Ronald Reagan last week.


About 180 Asian and Pacific American leaders from throughout the country attended a briefing on Thursday, Feb. 23 at the Old Administration Building across from the White House.


They were welcomed by President Reagan and members of his Cabinet, who stressed the importance they place on the Asian American community in forming the government's policies.


Subjects covered included civil rights, bilingual education, the economy and foreign policy. Many of the leaders in attendance said they were impressed with Reagan's sincerity in trying to attract Asian Americans to play a stronger role in his administration for the good of their communities and for the country at large.


In a speech before them, Reagan praised Asian Pacific Americans for ""living up to the bedrock values that make us a good and worthy people.""


""It's no wonder that the median income of Asian and Pacific American families is much higher than the total American average,"" Reagan continued. ""After all, it is values, not programs and policis, that serve as our nation's compass.""


Reagan stressed that the nation's economic recovery is well under way, as evidenced by recent reports that housing starts and personal income are up and that in January the sales of durable goods rose.


The President also pointed out that the U.S. has a ""promising future"" in its relations with nations in the Pacific Basin.


While on the subject of foreign relations, Reagan said the January visit of China's Premier Zhao has paved the way for improved relations while preserving America's right to continue support for Taiwan.


""Friendship gives both countries the freedom to disagree, even to criticize without fear of lessening cooperation and understanding,"" Reagan said.


""We will continue to support (Taiwan's) needs and requirements in accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Realations Act,"" Reagan said to an outburst of applause.


William Bradford Reynolds, the assistant Attorney General in charge of the Vincent Chin case, said the Reagan administration is taking the case very seriously and will continue to pursue justice for Asian Americans. Chin was killed by two unemployed autoworkers in Detroit, who were later fined and put on probation after admitting their guilt.


Reynolds said the defendants have asked for a change of venue in the federal case against them for denial of Chin's civil rights, but he added that the government will fight such a move.


U.S. Treasurer Donald Regan said the economic recovery is helping Asian American businesspeople. A number of people at the meeting, however, expressed the concern that Asian American small business owners need more government contracts and other assistance. Though the economy is on the upswing, they said, many are still not doing well.


A spokesman of the Education Dept. told the meeting of plans for a $13 million center to be built in Hawaii, which would study the specific needs of Asians as regards to bilingual education.


But Herbert Yee, who is the first vice president of the Asian American Republican National Association and also the executive secretary of the California Asian American Republican Assn., said there should be more discussion of the bilingual education center.


""I'm curious why they said it should be in Hawaii. It would seem we ought to locate it on the West Coast, where I think there is a larger concentration of Asian Americans needing bilingual education,"" Yee said.


Yee, who lives in Orange County, said the tremendous influx of Asian Americans, Asian immigrants and Southeast Asian refugees into Orange County in the past several years has created a need for attention in that area.


He said, though, that with the economic recovery ""things have gotten much better for the Asians in Southern California.""


Richard Y. Koo, managing partner of Koo, Chow & Co. in Los Angeles, the only Chinese American member of the state Republican Party's Central Executive Committee and also the chairman of the Asian Pacific American Republican Assn., said APAs should immediately begin preparing for the next White House conference.


""The White House told us these briefings with Asian Pacific Americans will be held each year from now on,"" Koo said. ""I feel that next time, the people participating in the briefing should do their homework, should figure out in advance exactly what points they want to cover and what questions they want to ask.""


""I think we touch on most of the important issues, but there were many things we had no time to discuss,"" Koo continued. ""Next time the representatives of the Asian American community should be more organized, better prepared to deal with all the issues.""


According to Brenda Wong, an assistant to the associate director of the White House Office for Public Liaison, Asian American representatives from 13 states attended the briefing. She said they were from groups of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and Indian heritage.


Ron Wakabayashi, national director of the Japanese American Citizens League, expressed concern that the next briefing be betting planned and that participants should give a better representation of the different Asian groups.


""Mike Suzuki represented the JACL at the briefing,"" Wakabayashi said in San Francisco. ""I didn't find out there was a briefing going on until almost as it was happening. And Suzuki told me later that he only saw one other Japanese American from the West Coast there that he recognized.""


Dr. Youn-Cha Shin Chey, director of the Multi-Services Center for Koreans in San Francisco, applauded the Reagan administration for showing sensitivity to Asian Americans. She said she did not know of any Korean Americans from Northern California who attended the event, however.


""We should let more new people get involved,"" Koo said of future briefings. ""So often we have the same people attending political affairs such as this. We should also get more young people involved, not only to get a fresh perspective but also to begin training our community leaders for tomorrow.""


""Given the amount of time we had, it was a very broad-ranged dialogue,"" noted Yee. ""I think it has at least opened the channels of communication between the Asian American community and the White House.""


Yee added that chances for increased communication would ""perhaps be better"" if an Asian American liaison were appointed to the White House staff. But he praised Linas Kojelas, the associate director of public liaison, for showing sensitivity to Asian Americans and for setting up the White House session.


""Kojelas has been traveling the country and meeting with leaders of many ethnic groups, and I think he is doing a fine job,"" Yee said.


One Asian American leader credited Anna Chennault with influencing the decision to hold a briefing for Asian Americans. Reagan embraced Chennault and praised her during his speech.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Outrage over the use of a racist slur against Chinese Americans on the cover of a national magazine continued to grow this week, with leaders of other minority groups denouncing the magazine for its action.


The National Review, a conservative magazine edited by William F. Buckley Jr., used the word ""Chink"" on the front cover of its May 4 edition, in reference to an article entitled, ""The Underhandedness of Affirmative Action."" (See Asian Week, 5/4/84.)


Chinese Americans throughout the country reacted angrily to use of the slur, and were joined this week by leaders of civil rights groups of other minorities.


And as furor was rising against the National Review, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford University, issued a statement that Affirmative Action does more harm than good.


The Hoover Institution's Thomas Sowell, a black, issued a statement that the rate of advance in employment for blacks ""was greater in the decade before Civil Rights legislation than in the decade after.""


Ron Wakabayashi, national director of the Japanese American Citizens League, said the current wave of racism from conservatives was just more of the ""benign neglect"" minorities have suffered from all sides of the political spectrum. But the said he was shocked by the National Review's use of an ethnic slur.


""I am surprised that a magazine of that calibre would be using that kind of language on its front cover. I would have expected them to be more subtle,"" Wakabayashi said.


Virna M. Canson, regional director on the West Coast for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, vowed that the NAACP will not stand for any erosion of Affirmative Action.


""It's clear that the Reagans, the Sowells and the Buckleys of this country are making a frontal attack on the gains made by minorities,"" Canson said. ""The destruction of the Civil Rights Commission, the Justice Department siding with schools that segregate -- it's evident in so many things they have done.""


S.F. Supervisor Doris Ward said that ""the use of ethnic and racial slurs...reveals the saddest type of ignorance and lack of respect for others.""


Board of Supervisors President Wendy Nelder said the magazine's use of a racialslur was ""shocking,"" and charged that it was done deliberately ""to provoke anger and foment trouble.""


""I think it's probably more astonishing for San Franciscans to hear of something like this, because we've worked so many years to tear down racial and ethnic barriers. It's so far removed from the attitude in San Francisco that it's like watching an old movie and seeing what people did 50 years ago,"" Nelder said.


Henry Der, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, charged that Sowell was ""talking out of both sides of his mouth.""


""He has no data to prove Affirmative Action is not working,"" Der said. ""In our own experience we have seen more integration of businesses and professions as a direct result of Affirmative Action programs.""


Der added that it is too early to abandon Affirmative Action.


""From 1964 to 1984 there have been tremendous changes in the labor force and American business. America is no longer an industrial society. It is becoming an information society, and while some minorities have made inroads into the new types of employment, Affirmative Action will be needed to assure full participation by minorities in the new economy,"" Der said.

A University of Washington graduate school student has compiled an index of Chinese American writers in Washington. Oregon and Idaho as part of a cooperative project between the UW and Washington State University Asian American Studies programs. Tracy Lai, who will soon receive a master's degree in multi-ethnic education, said the emphasis of her work has been on Chinese writers who have written about Chinese American communities.


Other students at the UW and WSU have indexed Japanese, Korean, Filipino and Southeast Asian writers for the project, which will be published by the WSU Asian American Studies program. The project will serve as a resource guide, and will be available for libraries and schools.


Lai explained that the resource guide will update the ""Asians in the Northwest"" bibliography, which only covers material up to 1978. The resource guide will also contain other types of information, such as people and organizations to contact and places like the Wing Luke Museum, which a bibliography would not contain.


The resource guide is scheduled to be published soon, but Lai said additional material can be added for later printings because the information is stored on a computer system. Lai said people often have community newsletters and other informally printed materials in their personal collections which could be valuable for someone researching the local Asian American communities. ""We're looking for things that probably won't appear in the New York Times Book Review,"" Lai joked.


Gail Nomura and Steve Sumida of the WSU Asian American Studies program have been interested in gathering material about Northwest Asian American literature, particularly fiction, and were able to raise the money to publish the resource guide, Lai said. She added that each of the people gathering the material for the guide had slightly different goals and interests, so the guide may vary from section to section. But she feels the resource guide will ""make it a little easier and a little faster to get an idea of what has already been written"" about Asian Americans in the Northwest.


Forher section of the guide, Lai indexed the stories relating to Chinese Americans that have appeared in the International Examiner. She also talked to people in the local Chinese community such as Doug Chin, Danny Woo, and the late Willard Jue. Lai also gathered information from the Northwest Collection at the UW Library and the East Asian Studies Library.


Lai went to the federal archives hoping to locate material such as immigration records, but she found it very difficult to find all the material in the archives. Lai did write some advice on locating information in the archives for the resource guide, however.


Lai worked on the project as a research assistant, a position funded through the minority division of the university's graduate school. Lai did the research for the Asian American Studies program during her last quarter at the UW. Lai will receive her degree from the college of education.


If people have material or know of people who should be contacted by researchers, Lai suggested they call the WSU Asian American Department at (509) 335-1966 or 335-6275.


""A lot of times people really downplay the importance of material such as news-letters,"" Lai said, ""because they think it's not professional looking or something. But these materials often give better insights into our history.""

The Asian Express tennis team will try to go out with a bang as they compete together for the last time in the U.S. Tennis Association-Michelob Light Tennis League Championships in Kansas City from October 4 to 7.


The Michelob Light tournament is a nation-wide program which gives local teams the chance to participate in a playoff structure based on ability. The Express, which consists of 13 team members, will compete against 20 teams from around the country for the championship.


There are 13 members on the team, with Ben Carlos, Brian Kent and Randy Wong the most recent members. The rest, from the 1982 championship team, are: Gary Hanada, Bob Hashimoto, Wayne Kawakami, Danny Kim, Edward Kim, Winfred Lim, Wilbert Look, David Mark, Roger Mark and Jeff Nomi.


The Asian Express has competed in the Michelob Light tournament for three consecutive years, this year moving up to the top skill level of competition.


Last year, the Asian Express won the Pacific Northwest sectional championship. In 1982, the team won the national championship in New York.


Asian Express Coach Winnie Lim said, ""I don't think we would have stuck together for that long if we weren't compatible. All the players' wives and girlfriends get along well.""


The Express recently won the Pacific Northwest sectional championship in Portland, competing against teams from Spokane, Vancouver and Idaho.


Lim pointed out that the team members have been practicing twice a week at the Seattle Tennis Center, usually past 11 p.m.


""Our goal this year was to just win the Northwest and if we made it to the nationals, that would be frosting on the cake,"" Lim said. ""Spokane had us practically beat, but our doubles teams won it for us. We were really lucky. It's going to be tough in Kansas City.""


After barely squeaking by the Spokane team, coach Lim is going into the national tournament with a reverse strategy of sorts. ""I'm putting all our strength in doubles,"" Lim said. ""Most teams do the opposite by putting their strength in singles.""


The status of the team is still up in the air after the national tournament is over, according to Lim. ""They told us we can possibly keep three original players and start a new team,"" Lim said, ""but I'm not sure. They'll let us know when we get to Kansas City.""

PALO ALTO -- Padmashree Sanjukta Panigrahi and her husband, Panidt Raghunath Panigrahi, the vocalist of Panigrahi's five accompanying musicians, made Cubberly High School auditorium one of their 20 United States appearances on Nov. 3.


The two artists from the state of Origin India dedicated their concert to the memory of the late Indira Gandhi. Since Panigrahi and her guru Kelucharan Mohapatra had both been given the title of Padmashree by the President of India, a title they shared with the late Bharata Natyam exponent T. Balasaraswati, expectations regarding Sanjukta's artistry were extremely high. In mid-October, Joseph Mazo, the dance critic for Women's Wear Daily, had written that seeing her dance was one of the most surpassing experiences in his career as a dance lover.


Well, Mazo might extoll Sanjukta for her guru Kelucharau Machaprtia was a lineal descendant of the maharis dedicated to the temple at Puri, the temple dedicated to the lord Jagganath. Observance of the great Car Festival dedicated to Jagganath has given rise to the English term juggernaut which implies a form which crushes all obstacles in its path. And the high level of ecstatic frenzy devotees exhibit might well have led English colonialists to translate religious devotion as a heartless, inhuman force.


The Odissi form is the most openly appealing of all Indian classical dance forms; for the feminine exponent the forcu most laden with obvious charm. It attracts Western students as well as Indian ones who have exhibited an undeviating display of sensual invitation and seductive abilities. To find erotica laced with subtlety and a spirit hich transcends the obvious aspects of Odissi's sensuality is rare. Sanjukta provides this relief with utmost delicacy and a physical vibrato unlike any other Odissi exponent I have seen.


Sanjukta for all the strength and energy she has and her considerable technical command, is the personification of feminine entreaty.


Entreaty is not a popular feminine stance in the West, probably because it implies an patriarchal absolutism which in the West usually is considered pretty hopeless. Pleading, etc., isn't exactly considered ""adult"" or ""mature"" in parlance of responsible adulthood, and certainly not in Western psychology texts. It implies-helplessness. But coming in Sanjukta's art, nothing could display the feminine and the strength of the pursuasive powers of the feminine more surely or more gently. The exhibition is cumulative and overwhelming. Sanjukta may be guilty of slightly excessive displays now and again, but she is an emotional artist, not an intellectual one. The emotional capacities spill over the form, reaching us gently and firmly across the proscenium arch.


In her accented but articulate English, Sanjukta demonstrated the nine rasas, or sentiments which provided the audience with clues to the emotions which were experessed in her dances. She also demonstrated some of the salient mudras and what they meant in the text of the songs to which she danced, sung with such texture and vocal variety by her husband. The themes were familiar ones to Indian mythology; Radha being prepared for a visit in the dark of night for the waiting Lord Krishna; Sita being snared into captivity by the golden deer sent to entice her by the demon Ravanna (a theme which has spread through Southeast Asia as subject matter for dancing.)


One of the many interesting facets to Sanjukta's performance was the fact that she danced pieces which were choreographed by her guru Keulucharan Mohapatra. That there are gurus who are creating within a classical idiom in India today is rare; that the grasp of the idiom is as sound and seemingly true to the classical tradition as the dance appeared is even more rare. It is as if the themes from the Old Testament, well worn as they are, were being rendered yet again in a different way by an artist who has danced older forms of the Biblical legends for many years.


In one instance Sanjukta, in a seated position, completed a full circle, pushing herself around with one leg while the other was tucked underneath her, arm propped against the knee of the foot which propelled her body around, in perfect cadence with the mdrangam. It was a startling and exiting choreographic invention.


One final observation which helps to convey the extraordinary quality of Sanjukta's art and interpretive capacities: While she showed us the difference between the natural and the stylized in a given mood, her skill as an artist seemed wholly personal and quite innocently intimate. The sense of intimacy and the sense of the revelation of feminine hopes, fears and moods, as well as the keen imitations of masculine actions in her gestural pieces, was another dominant impression. There is little in Western dance which appears that private, and for the Sanjukta's art is a reminder that art is a personal revelation at its best.


Artists expose themselves and their capacity for loving with great courage and considerable vulnerability. That an audience can be refreshed and moved as was the audience on Nov. 3 is testimony to the healing and transforming ability of artistic expression.


The almost totally Indian audience came to the performance with Indira Gandhi on its collective consciousness. Through the art of Panigrahi their karuna or sorrow received its reconciliation. Because of the confluence of the artists and the tragic event a special moment in history was bathed with a rare blessing and benediction.

The Chinese Forum, a non-partisan group of Chinese American community business and academic leaders in California, last week urged President Reagan to appoint a Chinese American to fill the current vacancy on the National Science Board.


U.S. Senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston of California, as well as leaders of the Chinese American community nationwide, have given their support to this effort.


In the entire history of the National Science Board, no Asian American has ever been appointed to the Board. The Board oversees the National Science Foundation, which has an annual budget of over $1 billion for basic and developmental research in all aspects of science.


Senator Pete Wilson said, ""Considering the great contributions Chinese Americans have made to science and technology over the past four decades, the National Science Board would be well served with the addition of a member from the Chinese American community.""


Senator Cranston said, ""The Americans of Chinese ancestry have contributed much to American science and technology. Representation on the National Science Board would be fitting recognition of their contribution to the advance of the human frontier.""


The members of the Chinese Forum have recommended the following individuals for the current vacancy: Dr. Chang Ling Tien, Vice Chancellor and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Ernest Kuh, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley; Dr. Chia-Wei Woo, President and Professor of Physics at San Francisco State University; and Dr. Chen Ning Yang, Professor of Physics at the State University of New York.

The Asian Pacific Women's Caucus will hold a banquet November 13 to honor five ""woman warriors"" -- Norie Sato, Ruth Woo, Dr. Julia Wan, Dolores Sibonga and Lori Matsukawa -- for their talents and acknowledge them as role models for the younger generation.


The Caucus, a community organization formed in 1977 to address issues affecting Asians, is a member of the Asian-Pacific Women's National Network.


According to Cynthia Rekdal of the Caucus, the woman warrior award derives from an ancient story well known to many Asian cultures. In China, the original woman warrior, Hua Mu Lan, disguised herself as a man to take her father's place in a war against the Tartars.


This month's award winners, Rekdal said, ""are warriors of a different age.""


Norie Sato, a dynamic video artist, was selected for her contribution to the arts. She has received local and national awards, and her work is included in many museums around the country. Born in Japan, she has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Michigan and a Master's in Fine Arts from the University of Washington. Sato, considered an innovator in video arts, currently has a show at the Seattle Center.


Ruth Woo, an administrative assistant in the State Department of Natural Resources, will receive an award for community service. She has worked actively in many political campaigns and has been very committed to Asian candidates. Woo, typical of the award winners, ""not only made her own way, but is more than willing to give a helping hand to those who need it,"" Rekdal said. Woo, she added, is a ""very warm, knowledgeable and sincere individual"" who ""brings with her the influence of the culture.""


Dr. Julia Wan, currently assistant superintendent of the Bainbridge Island School District, is very active in Chinese politics throughout the West Coast and has been president of the Boston chapter of the National Organization of Women. She's a member of Chinese for Affirmative Action in San Francisco and is on the board of directors of the Chinese Community Public Affairs Organization.


Dolores Sibonga, Seattle City Council member, will receive an award for her achievements in government and politics. Sibonga, on the City Council since 1978, is the first minority woman to serve in that capacity. ""Quiet, but extremely savvy, she gets things done,"" says Rekdal. Sibonga is highly accessible and always willing to help, Rekdal commented. ""She has truly supported other Asians' climb up the ladder.""


Lori Matsuka a, who currently works for KING-TV's ""Top Story,"" and co-hosts ""Celebrate the Differences,"" has been involved in a variety of community activities, including volunteer work for the Japanese American Citizens League and serving on the board of directors for the Asian Counseling and Referral Service. She has worked as anchor woman, producer and reporter for KOMO and KING-TV.


The awards function at the Silver Dragon Restaurant begins at 6:30 p.m. with cocktails, followed by dinner and the awards ceremony. Representatives of various organizations and political groups will be present. The dinner fee of $15 may be sent to: Asian Pacific Women's Caucus, P.O. Box 15966, Seattle 98115-0966. For reservations, call 522-9858 or 259-5611.

Chinese Americans in this country are the minority of the minorities. Many of the different nationalities have come to the United States to seek new opportunity, to seek freedom, to pursue a better future and higher education so that we all can be good citizens of this great nation. Recent research has shown that approximately one out of every ten Chinese Americans in this country has a college degree or higher standard of education. This certainly is a very outstanding record. We should all be very proud of it.


Many older Chinese first came to this country as laborers. They built railroads, they worked in the mines and they fought and died in four wars - the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam conflict. We of the younger generation are grateful because our forbears worked hard in order to give us higher education. It has been a long journey for many of the so-called foreign-born Americans. We share the same frustrations, disappointments, and on many occasions discrimination, therefore, today we particularly want to pay tribute to the men and women who have worked positively to overcome prejudice and problems placed before them with dignity, with compassion and with dedication.


In the '80s the United States is going through many changes and is confronted with numerous challenges. In order to preserve the greatness of this country and to enrich prosperity and progress in the future, we must encourage all citizens regardless of color and race to gather our strength, to utilize our talent to meet the ever-changing social environment of today.


Today the Chinese Americans do not ask for social help, they ask for social justice. They do not ask for special treatment, but equal opportunity. We recognize there's no more disconcerting waste than the waste of human talent and potential and there's no greater investment than investment in human fulfillment. It is time for all Chinese Americans to unite and work together to participate in our country's affairs, to get involved for the benefit and opportunity of a great society. As a democracy we ask for our country and her people to continue to better our political system. We as Chinese Americans belong to this system. We speak for democracy and the dignity of the individual.


Anna Chennault is a business leader, and writer. Presently she is the Vice Chairman of President Reagan's Export Council, the Chairman of the President's Heritage Council, Advisor to the Reagan-Bush Campaign, and National Chairman of the Chinese Americans for Reagan-Bush Campaign.

BANGKOK -- George Orwell, were he alive today, would sneer and say, ""I told you so.""


Those who read Orwell's classic 1984 will recall the phenomenon called ""Hate Day,"" when good citizens would cleanse their systems by venting hatred toward their enemies. They would gnash their teeth and tremble with rage as members of The Party would flash pictures of the number one enemy, and a Pavlovian response to the sight of the enemy's image was common.


Now United Press reports that thousands of people turned out to mark Kampuchea's (Cambodia's) National Day of Hatred.


The National Day of Hatred was called to allow Cambodians to vent their anger against the deposed Khmer Rouge regime, which was led by Pol Pot. The regime has been accused of killing up to three million people before being driven from power by invading Vietnamese in 1979.


The Day of Hatred was also directed against ""Chinese expansionists"" and ""American imperialists,"" UPI reported.


SPK, the voice of the Heng Samrin regime now in power, said that 1975 ""was the day the Pol Pot gang began to implement its systematic, overt and savage genocidal policy against the Kampuchean people throughout the country.""

MANILA -- Relatives and supporters of Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino will raise the money needed to get a status of the slain opposition leader through customs in time to be unveiled on the anniversary of his assassination, it was announced earlier this week.


Officials at the Manila International Airport, scene of Aquino's assassination a year ago, refused to allow a bronze statue to be delivered until $3,970 in duties had been paid for it, according to Associated Press.


The status was sculpted by Filipino artist Tomas Concepcion in Rome, and was shipped to the Philippines via New York. It was to be unveiled in conjunction with national marches and rallies on Tueday to mark the first anniversary of Aquino's death.


Assessors at the airport first calculated duties based on a value of $25,000 for the statue. After protest they lowered their assessment to $12,652, and then finally set the value at $10,000.


""It should not be taxed, because it is a gift to the Filipino people,"" said Tessy Oreta, Aquino's sister.


Butz Aquino said he and other family members would raise the money to pay the tax.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chinatown's sidewalk display stands seem to still be a problem as store merchants and sidewalk stand vendors battled over turf at a street peddler permit revocation hearing on Tuesday.


Commander D. Klapp at police headquarters listened to concern raised by store merchants over the total of 2,500 street peddler permits issued by the police department last year.


""There is no review process, no checking whether the street peddlers are selling the correct merchandise at the correct location,"" Amy Chung of the Stockton Street Merchants Association told Asian Week. ""All they have to do is send in their money.""


Merchants also charged that some permits were given out illegally in violation of several city traffic and health codes.


Traffic and health problems cannot be used as an excuse to take away the rights of the sidewalk vendors, noted Louis Hop Lee, who is representing the sidewalk peddlers.


Review of the street peddlers' permits will continue in two weeks.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Ong Hing, associate professor of law at Golden Gate University, has joined Simmons & Ungar, a San Francisco law firm which has specialized in Immigration & Nationality law matters for more than 30 years.


Prof. Hing, who formerly was the director of the Immigration Unit of S.F. Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation in Chinatown, has been on the faculty at Golden Gate University School of Law since 1979. He has also taught courses on immigration law at the University of San Francisco School of Law and New College School of Law.

SAN FRANCISCO -- After standing in a line wrapping halfway around the block outside in the Civic Center, they finally found themselves inside the auditorium and standing in shorter lines to pick up the government certificates for which they had waited years.


""We won't start the ceremony until the very last citizenship certificate has been picked up. Don't worry -- you're all going to become citizens at the same time today,"" called out a court worker to the fidgety immigrants in the lines.


At last, all of them were seated in the main hall of the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. The 43-piece 6th Army Band from the Presidio struck up a snappy marching tune, and guests in the upper seating areas waved their encouragement.


Such was the scene here Tuesday as about 6000 immigrants raised their right hands to take the oath and become naturalized as new citiznes of the United States of America.


According to David Ilchert, district director of the Immigration & Naturalization Service, Tuesday's mass naturalization hearing was the largest in San Francisco history. The crowd of new Americans had to be split into two groups of 3000 each for separate ceremonies in the morning and afternoon.


Most were Asian


According to figures released by the INS, more than three out of every four of those new citizens had immigrated from Asian Pacific countries. Of the 6000 total, 1800 were from the Philippines, 1800 were from China (figure includes Republic of China and People's Republic of China) and 900 were from Vietnam. All the immigrants together came from 35 countries.


""I've been looking forward to today,"" said Stephen Chang of El Sobrante. ""It's been a long time.""


Chang, who came here from Taiwan six and a half years ago, said his fifth and youngest son was born in the U.S. and now the older brothers would have a chance to also enjoy the fruits of citizenship. Chang said he will also petition for reunification visas for family members still in Taiwan.


Another broad smile was to be seen on the face of Bart Baraceron, now working for the school district in Crescent City, who came to the U.S. from Nueva Ecija in the Philippines eight years ago. Two of his five children have already become citizens of this country.


""This is a great day for me,"" beamed Paul Ng, a former soldier in the Soth Vietnamese Army now living in San Jose and working for an electronics firm in Silicon Valley. ""I've been waiting over five years for this.""


Also from Vietnam were Lu Ha and his wife Muoi. Ha is now working as a baker in Oakland.


Voter registration snafu


Though some groups did set up voter registration tables outside the auditorium for the morning and afternoon swearing-in ceremonies, misunderstandings apparently led to many of the new citizens not being made aware they could register to vote right after the ceremony.


Ilchert told Asian Week that the League of Women Voters would give voter registration cards to all the new citizens from a booth inside the auditorium.


But Vivian Hopkins, chair of the LWV voter registration committee, said the organization is no longer able to have members bring registration cards to such functions, and was surprised to hear that Ilchert had not yet been informed.


""As I understand it, they might not even be getting registration cards. I wish we had enough personnel to have somebody down there working on this,"" Hopkins said. ""It might be something for us to focus on next year -- it would be a worthwhile project.""


The Chinese American Democratic Club, which in the past has claimed to enroll large numbers of new voters at naturalization ceremonies, also failed to take advantage of the event Tuesday, though some of its members were helping out the Chinese American Voters Education Committee in its efforts there, according to CADC President Barbara Lee.


Lee said the CADC had originally asked the INS for permission to set up a registration table inside the auditorium but was told the League of Women Voters was handling that task and that other organizations would not be allowed in.


Paul Chung of the S.F. Registrar of Voters office told Asian Week Monday that he was planning on taking two asistants along as he tried to get voter materials to the San Francisco residents in the ceremony.


""This is the first time they have naturalized so many people at once, and it's rather exciting for us. They'll keep us busy, I hope,"" Chung said.


Ted Laquatan, head of the Filipino American Political Association, said his group had signed up more than 270 new voters at the morning ceremony alone, and expected at least as many at the afternoon ceremony.


Demonstration outside


A quiet demonstration was held outside the auditorium by members of the Bay Area Committee Against the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, who warned that the immigration bill would result in employment discrimination against non-whites if passed.


The bill was in the final stages of negotiation by members of the Senate and House of Representatives ironing out differences between the two versions. A compromise version of the bill was expected to be submitted for a vote as early as this week.


BACASM objects to the bill's tendency to portray ""undocumented workers as people who are 'taking the jobs away from U.S. citizens,'"" according to a press release.

BERKELEY -- Senator Gary Hart personally outlined his positions on isues of concern to Asian Americans last week, and repeatedly stressed his support for civil rights Saturday when opening his campaign headquarters here.


In a letter dated April 12 to Barbara Lee, president of the Chinese American Democratic Club, Hart hailed the growing influence of the Asian American community.


""(Asian Americans') history in this country is one of rich contribution; their involvement in its future is vital if we are to fulfill our promise,"" Hart wrote.


Hart, in what one community leader called ""one of the few original responses"" to the Asian American community, stressed his opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, and his support for bilingual education, housing policies which will meet the needs of the Asian American community, special attention to the resettlement and acculturation of Southeast Asian refugees, equal access to and participation in federal minority business development programs, increased appointments of Asian Americans to governmental positions of importance, and actions to stem discrimination.


""Discrimination, exclusion and hostility take more subtle forms in today's society than they did in the days of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the National Origins Act of 1924, the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1935 and the Walters-McCarren Immigration Act of 1952,"" Hart wrote. ""The case of Vincent Chin is only one chilling example of the vigilance that must be exercised toward lingering prejudice and intolerance in the America of today and of the future.""


Hart addressed a number of Asian American concerns, including appointments.


""Appointments of Asian Americans, in the Hart Administration, will start at the White House. Asian Americans and other minorities should be represented in professional staff positions throughout the Executive Branch Certainly, that representation will include, but will not be confined to, those federal boards and agencies engaged in the formation and adjudication of civil rights policy,"" Hart wrote.


""I was a leader in the Senate opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Reform bill. The demographic specificities of the Asian American community offer an important perspective on the potential ill effects this measure could have on family reunification and civil rights of minorities in this country, both fundamental commitments of immigration policy since the Kennedy Immigration bill of 1965,"" Hart wrote.


Hart demonstrated his concern for business development by pointing out his sponsorship of the Community Assistance and Redevelopment Act, which he said will define ""the role that government can, must and should play in helping revitalize distressed communities.""


Hart said the measure creates financial incentives to small and minority businesses which create new jobs and hire community residents, and promotes training in new technology.


Hart emphasized his commitment to education.


""The Supreme Court decision in Lau v. Nichols taught us a grave lesson on the special educational needs of those students whose first language is not English,"" Hart wrote, adding that his commitment to bilingual education programs has remained consistent throughout his political career.


""The specific needs of Asian American children must be equitably provided for by these programs,"" Hart added.


Hart asked for more input from Asian Americans, saying that the inquiry from the CADC was the ""starting point for what I hope will be a continuing and rich exchange on these and other issues of mutual concern.""


But despite Hart's personal response to Asian Americans, not more than a handful turned out last Saturday for the opening of Hart's campaign headquarters in Berkeley.


Pop music of the 1960s was being played on the loud-speakers as several thousand Hart supporters, primarily young Caucasians, gathered at the corner of Adeline and Ashby on Saturday, April 14 to hear the candidate speak. Few minority members joined the huge crowd.


Rolling up his shirtsleeves in the hot afternoon sun, Hart wooed the crowd with appeals to liberal causes, and three times stressed his commitment to civil rights for minorities and equal rights for women. He also called for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.


""Let's look at what a second term for Ronald Reagan would mean,"" Hart said. ""It would mean the abandonment of 30 years of work for the civil rights of racial minorities,"" among other ""dangers"" he listed.


Coordinators for Hart's local campaign said the senator's swift rise had made it difficult to effectively organize in the Asian American community.


""I've never seen a campaign like this,"" said Frank Russo, coordinator in the 8th Congressional District. ""But my policy is to ignore no one in this campaign. We have leafleted Oakland Chinatown, and we plan further outreach attempts to the Asian American community in the East Bay.""


Campaign representative Barbara Terrell said Hart had met earlier that day with a number of Asian American leaders. She did not disclose the names of those leaders, nor the content of their discussions.

LOS ANGELES -- Research on the contributions of early Chinese American immigrants to China and on the residential choices of the newest Asian refugees, the Indochinese, to California are the focus of the latest issue of the Amerasia Journal.


Beginning in the 19th century, Chinese immigrants from Toisan County, Guangdong Province sent remittances to their families that were used in part to establish schools and public institutions. Renqiu Yu, a graduate student from the People's Republic of China, traces the development of overseas fundraising in America in support of education in Toisan. Without the substantial financial aid of these immigrants between the 1920s and the 1940s, it would not have been possible to universalize primary education in the county, Yu states. The essay suggests historical research on Chinese Americans can be expanded by considering the political, social and economic factors on both sides of the Pacific.


Differing greatly from these earlier Chinese immigrants, the latest newcomers to the U.S. are the Indochinese refugees. Since 1975 over 600,000 persons from Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea have been resettled. Jacqueline Desbarats and Linda Holland in their article examine the causes and implications of refugee residential patterns in Orange County, California, which has the densest concentration of Indochinese nationwide. The article examines factors affecting the refugees' choices of residence in the country.


Also in this issue of Amerasia Journal, Japanese American historian Yuji lchioka examines an instance of private Japanese diplomacy and its effect on organized American labor and Japanese immigrant workers in the period 1915-1916. The article explores the events surrounding the appearance of Suzuki Bunji, the first Asian delegate to the American Federation of Labor conventions in 1915 and 1916. Utilizing Japanese-language documents, Ichioka discusses Suzuki's attempts at lessening hostility towards immigration and Japanese workers.


Selected poems and an essay on the writing of poetry by Toyo Suyemoto, a second-generation Japanese American poet, also grace this issue. These poems are dedicated to her mother and to other Japanese women who stepped on American shores. Suyemoto has been writing since the 1930s and has been published in many literary magazines and newspapers.

Filipinos, someone once said, are ubiquitous. It simply means they are omnipresent, or present everywhere.


That observation may be especially true in San Francisco where there is a growing number of new ""arrivals"" (Philippine nationals), adding to the ""oldtimers"" who won't move elsewhere because they love the City by the Bay.


Walk any day on Kearney Street or Market or Mission, 99 times out of 100, you are bound to bump into a Filipino, dubbed ""Pinoy,"" who will greet you in his native tongue, ""Kumusta, Manong?"" with a solicitous smile.


There is a story or call it a joke among the ""oldtimers"" here, that if you throw a stone into a crowd on Market Street, you will hear someone cry, ""Aruy!"" Which shows that a Filipino has been hit by the stone. And for all you know, that person may turn out to be a relative if not an old friend you have not seen in years, or someone you met in the past.


That was what happened to me when I took a walk on Mission Street one late Sunday afternoon, something I hadn't done in a long long time. I was looking for a Filipino store called ""Tindahan Ng Mga Rosas."" I remember buying a pair of handmade slippers imported from the Philippines in the store, and also the best kind of bagoong, anchovy sauce. I missed the store ever since we moved to the outskirts of another town.


I kept walking until I came to a coffee shop near 29th and Mission. Looking inside, I saw a familiar face, Mang Esko? (I couldn't remember his real name) the man who used to live in the house right next to the apartment where I used to live on Godeus Street in the inner Mission District. I went inside the coffee shop and approached him. He was surprised but glad to see me. After an exchange of pleasantries, I asked, ""Mang Esko, I'm looking for a Filipino store called 'Tindahan Ng Mga Rosas, do you know where I can find it?""


""Ha,"" he barked. ""That store has long been gone!""


""Gone? You don't say. What happened?"" I asked.


We went outside the coffee shop, stood on the sidewalk and he pointed a finer to a Safeway Store half a block away. ""The Safeway people bought out the place and built their own store on it,"" he said.


""Oh no,"" I said, disappointed.


All the way home, I kept thinking about the Filipino store. I remember when I first saw the big, brightly painted sign outside that read, TINDAHAN NG MGA ROSAS or store of roses, I thought it was a place where they sold fresh roses and other flowers.


But when I entered the store. I discovered, to my surprise, that there were no roses or any other kind of flowers. What I found -- things on sale -- were dry goods, ranging from fabrics made in the Philippines for making women's dresses and men's apparel, to embroidered handkerchiefs and place mats, to handmade slippers and wooden shoes for men and women, to small crates of dried fish, to bottled goods like patis and bagoong, pickled mango and papaya, even santol, a native fruit. Not only Filipinos and other Asians patronized the store, but also Americans and other nationalities.


Why was it called ""Tindahan Ng Mga Rosas?""


I talked to a Filipino employee in the store, and I learned that the owner who was sitting atop a wooden stool in front of the cash register, a woman of enormous size, with greasy face, and who looked more like a native Samoan than a Filipina, smoking not the ordinary cigarette but a fat black cigar, was called Rosa. Her daughter, I was told, was also named Rosa. Her daughter's daughter, an eight or nine-year-old child playing outside, was likewise named Rosa. The woman's husband, a short, pot-bellied man, standing by the counter, reading a Filipino newspaper and also smoking the same kind of black cigar, was called Ross. His real name was Rosauro.


""Isn't that something?"" I chuckled after listening to the Filipino employee in the store.


""Yes, it is,"" he said, trying to conceal a smile.


I bought a bottle of pickled mango and left.


I returned the following day. I had forgotten to buy my favorite anchovy sauce, bagoong. I bought two bottles. As I was leaving, a tall, slightly graying Spanish-looking lady wearing a red rose in her hair, hurriedly entered the store and nearly bumped me on the way. I would have paid no attention and would have passed her by -- had she not stopped and looked at my face, smiled, then exclaimed, ""Oh, for goodness sake, Antonio! Tony?""


I looked at her, surprised. Recognizing the face, I exclaimed, ""Donia Dolores!""


""Isn't this a small world?"" she said, laughing.


""You bet it is,"" I said. Noting the rose in her hair, I asked, ""How is your garden of roses?""


Just then the loud, ear-wrecking honking of a horn interrupted our conversation, and she quickly turned to the store owner and said. ""Aling Rose, I need a bottle of pickled mango. Hurry, please, my daughter is in the car outside double parking.""


After she got what she came for in the store, she left, forgetting to say goodbye.


Who was Donia Dolores? How did I know her?


The story goes back to the time I was living in her apartment on Godeus Street in the Mission District of San Francisco


Donia Dolores, that was how everybody living in the building called her, tended a beautiful rose garden planted with different varieties. Oh, you should see those giant African roses blooming in a blaze of colors -- red and dark-red, pink and bright pink, yellow and deep yellow, even purple rose orange and pristine white, all dazzling to the eyes.


I lived in the apartment directly opposite her garden. At night when the wind blew. I could smell the scent of roses filtering through the crevices in my window.


Donia Dolores was a widow. She had a teenage daughter named Alicia, a sexy-looking girl just turned 14, wearing long hair that reached almost to her waist-line. She was always in gray jeans and bright-red tight-fitting turtle-neck sweater.


Alicia helped her mother tend the garden and water the roses every morning. In the early evening when the sun was down, she had a visitor, a tall, handsome young Filipino boy called Esmeraldo. He was her boyfriend. Often, I saw them walking in the garden, holding hands. They would stand under the shade of the old maple tree in the north side of the garden and do what young lovers do -- hug and kiss, passionately.


One time, I was standing by the window and I overheard them talking and laughing like little kids.


""Do you like roses?"" she asked, lovelights sparkling in her eyes. ""There're a thousand roses blooming in my mother's garden, you know,"" she added.


""Sure, sure,"" he replied, planting a kiss on her lips.


""You know something? How do you like if I filled your room with roses?"" she asked, plucking a rose bud from a branch and giving it to him.


The youth smelled the bud, smiled and intoned deeply, Oh, I don't want a room full of rose. I only want my arms full of you!""


She giggled loudly like she was tickled as he took her in his arms once more, and smothered her with kisses.


I laughed to myself when I heard those words of endearment the youth had uttered. I remember those words distinctly, the words in the song, ""A Room Full of Roses."" Funny -- I too had uttered those words, I mean, sang the song once, to a dark-eyed girl I fell in love with in my hometown of Caridad, Spanish for charity, in Cavite province, the Philippines. Her name was Meliguasina. Oh, lovely Meliguasina, named after a sweet-smelling flower called Meliguas. She was the youngest daughter of our neighbor next door. I tried my best to win her heart with my singing but failed miserably. It was probably on account of my voice -- it croaked badly in the middle of the song. It was my brother Nonong, six years my senior but endowed with a superb singing voice and who could play the guitar well, who was the winner. Meliguasina married him.


Looking at the scene before me -- a garden full of roses and two young carefree people happily in love, I felt as if I was being transported back in time -- borne on the wings of fantasy into the never-never land of my childhood dream and unrequited love. I felt my eyes misty with tears.

Seattle City Council member Dolores Sibonga will introduce an ordinance next Monday authorizing payment of $5,000 to each of four Japanese American city employees who lost their jobs when a federal evacuation order forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II.


At the same time, Seattle Mayor Charles Royer will introduce a resolution urging Washington state's Congressional delegation to support bills which provide direct monetary payment to interness.


Sibonga's proposed ordinance would enable eligible claimants to receive $2,500 each year for two years, the same pay-out formula as the one used by the Washington state legislature to compensate Japanese American state employees.


Last May, Washington state Governor John Spellman signed into law a bill providing $5,000 compensation to each of the 38 Japanese American state employees who were fired or resigned as a result of the evacuation order. The compensation bill, which recognized the ""grave injustice done to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry"" when these people were forced to abandon their homes and belongings, passed the Senate by a vote of 35 to 11 and the House by a vote of 57 to 37.


Last April, City Personnel Department Director Susan B. Pavlou, in a memorandum to Sibonga, wrote that Japanese city employees were terminated in March, 1942 as a direct result of the federal evacuation order.


Pavlou noted that the 1942-1943 Annual Report of the Civil Service Department said: ""When it became necessary, because of military reasons, to evacuate Japanese from this area, we provided for the separation of any of them who were working for the City, and we took action withholding the names of any who were on our registers from certification for appointment.""


The payroll register for April, 1942 showed no employees with Japanese surnames, Pavlou wrote, and it wasn't until late 1945 and early 1946 that the City began regularly appointing persons of Japanese ancestry.


""This legislation represents only token compensation for what was actually lost by our local citizens of Japanese ancestry,"" Sibonga said. ""However, it is both morally and legally correct that we take this action. Other municipal and state governments have enacted similar legislation. The City of Seattle should do what is fair and just.""


Tim Otani, regional director of the Pacific Northwest District Council of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), said, ""The bill to compensate Japanese American City employees is a positive step toward correcting the wrongs committed under the guise of military necessity.""


And Alan Kurimura, assistant to Mayor Charles Royer, said, ""How I look at it is that countries and people remember instances of wrongdoing if there's a cost involved; it makes an impression on them. The $5,000 is miniscule in comparison with the losses suffered by Japanese Americans -- in terms of real and personal property. The compensation makes a clear point to elected officials that if something like this happens again, next time there will be a price to pay.""


Kurimura said Mayor Royer will encourage support for redress at meetings of the Conference of Mayors in June and the League of Cities in November.


Under Sibonga's proposed ordinance, compensation for the four Japanese American employees terminated during World War II would come from the City's Emergency Fund.


Sibonga will introduce the ordinance at a meeting of the Budget and Finance Committee, which she chairs, on February 6.


A public hearing will be held on the proposed ordinance in the City Council chambers February 15 at 5 p.m.


Otani encouraged interested persons to attend the public hearing. Among those already scheduled to speak is U.S. Congressional Representative Mike Lowry, who has spearheaded redress efforts in the U.S. Congress. For more information, call the JACL at 623-5088.

LOS ANGELES -- As the country observed Asian Pacific American Heritage Week, KNBC-TV News aired a five-part series called ""Asian America"" which looked closely at the Asian population in the U.S. and particularly in Southern California.


Reported by news anchor-woman Tritia Toyota, the series looked at the recent rise in anti-Asian sentiments and violence, at the demographics of the various Asian American groups and what social problems they face, about stereotypes -- both negative and positive, at the increase of Asian participation in American politics, and at the future prospects of the Asian American community.


Stan Kawakami, who produced the series with Frank Kwan, said the series may be expanded into a one-hour special program to be aired this summer.


Kawakami told Asian Week that one of the stereotypes examined in the series is the widespread belief that ""Asians take care of their own.""


""We found a lot of public agencies really packed with underprivileged or low-income Asian Americans. So contrary to popular belief, there are a lot of Asians out there who are not being taken care of,"" Kawakami said.


The entry of Asian Pacific Americans into politics was also featured, with interviews of June Poesi, the first Samoan American woman to run for city council in Carson, California, and Lily Chen, the mayor of Monterey Park.


In the segment about the future, Toyota considered such influences as the arrival of new immigrants as well as the impact of intermarriage with non-Asian Americans.


To close the segment, the cameras focused on the jazz group Hiroshima. ""We thought that represented quite a fusion between the cultures of East and West,"" Kawakami said.

MANILA -- At least three people were injured when a financial institution tried to reopen after an earlier panic had closed it for a nine-day ""bank holiday,""


A huge crowd of depositors shattered a glass wall and cracked the glass doors of a Banco Filipino branch in Quezon City as they surged forward during its reopening, according to Associated Press. An AP photographer said he saw three people suffer cuts, but none appeared serious.


Amidst a run by nervous depositors, the bank had closed for a nine-day ""holiday,"" accusing the Central Bank of refusing to give it cash advances. Rifle-carrying police and soldiers were guarding the bank's 89 branches as they reopened Aug. 1.


The guards at the Quezon branch had attempted to regulate the flow of customers into the bank, allowing only small groups in at a time. But the impatient crowd outside surged forward, causing damage.


A number of women were seen weeping as the crowd jostled them, and three women -- two of them pregnant -- collapsed from heat prostration. Bank personnel brought them inside.


President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the Central Bank to advance cash to Banco Filipino because he feared the panic might spread to other institutions. Central Bank Gov. Jose Femadez had complained that Banco officials were misusing the advances, and suggested Banco sell shares to partners who could make it more solid.

The fight for Washington's 70 delegate votes at the Democratic national convention begins in earnest on Super Tuesday, March 13, at 8 p.m. At that time, Democrats across the state will meet in precinct caucuses to select delegates representing their presidential candidate and to begin debate on a party platform.


It's called Super Tuesday because 10 states will hold their party caucuses or primary elections all on the same day. In all, more than 600 delegate votes will be up for grabs. Many believe that any candidate who can sweep the 10 states will have the nomination locked up. On the other hand, any candidate who falters badly on that day may be forced from the race.


Five candidates remain in the Democratic race: John Glenn, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, George McGovern and Walter Mondale. Whomever wins will face Ronald Reagan in the presidential election this November. All five have campaigns in the Seattle area, and all five are seeking supporters to attend the precinct caucuses on March 13.


In addition to candidates, a local coalition, We the People, is attempting to persuade both parties to adopt a nuclear weapons freeze resolution as part of their party platform. Other groups and individuals may attend the caucuses to push for adoption of their resolutions as well, on issues such as peace in Central America and support for the Equal Rights Amendment.


Anyone who is a resident registered voter in a precinct may vote in the Democratic precinct caucuses, but only in their home precinct. The caucus meetings will start promptly at 8 p.m. on March 13 in each precinct. Meetings are usually held in someone's home or occasionally in a local school or meeting hall. Anyone, whether registered or not, may attend to observe and participate in discussions, though they will not be able to vote.


At the caucus meetings, issues and resolutions for the platform will be discussed and voted on Delegate selection for presidential candidates will be conducted. Based on the number of supporters for each candidate who are present, delegates will be assigned to one or more candidates. It is important to note that the most popular candidates may not get any delegates if his supporters fail to attend these meetings.


The delegates chosen at the precinct caucuses will then proceed to the Legislative District caucuses or a County Convention in April. Again, delegates for candidates will be selected, and they will proceed on to the Congressional District caucuses and the state convention. It is at these meetings that the final decisions on party platform and on Washington's 70 delegates to the national convention will be made.


In order to participate in the process at all you must be registered to vote. This can be done anytime up to 8 p.m. on March 13. Voter registration can be done at any Seattle community center, all Seattle Fire Departments, all branch public libraries, public schools and the King County Administration Building. A variety of organizations -- including churches, We the People, civic organizations, Jesse Jackson for President Committee, League of Women Voters -- will also conduct voter registration drives and set up tables at shopping centers and malls.


If you wish to attend your precinct caucus on March 13, but don't know where to go, or if you have any other questions, help is available. The Secretary of State's office in Olympia has opened a toll-free hotline for voter information: 1-800-562-5637.


In Seattle, the Democratic party headquarters can help at 583-0664. Or you can call the King County Democratic Central Committee at 622-9157. And the King County elections department has a caucus hotling staffed by political party volunteers at 344-7625.


The 1984 elections could be a major turning point in U.S. politics Issues of unemployment, budget deficits, civil rights and foreign policy are being sharply debated. It makes good sense to think about ways in which you might affect our future policies. The Democratic precinct caucuses are one close and available way.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Civil Rights Commission announced it would be conducting interviews in the San Francisco Bay Area the week of Nov. 1 as part of its investigation into the increase in anti-Asian sentiments and violence, Asian Week has learned.


""Our purpose is to document whether these acts are racially motivated, and to suggest possible solutions to halt this trend,"" said project director Tom Watson.


The commission called for a study on anti-Asian violence after repeated requests from Asian American individuals and organizations alarmed by the increase of such incidents in the past few years. The most notable cases have been the killings of Vincent Chin in Detroit and Thong Hy Huynh in Davis, Calif., acts against Vietnamese fishermen in Texas and the rise of ""white power"" hotlines which spread racial hatred on local telephone lines.


""A number of communities have held hearings on these incidients, and we will looking at reports and transcripts from those hearings,"" Watson said, adding that he will be interviewing a number of Asian American civil rights activists in the Bay Area as well.


Watson could not suggest any possible solutions to the increasing anti-Asian bigotry, but said the Civil Rights Commission's study of the problem is a step in the right direction. ""Publicizing the fact that this (the violence) is happening will certainly help put a stop to it, but right now I don't know what other specific steps will be needed,"" he said.


Those wishing to volunteer information for the study can write to U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Attn: Tom Watson, 1121 Vermont Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20425, or call (202) 376-8443.

1984 may be a year of pleasant surprises for some people, when some of their prayers are answered and some of their dreams come true.


To Adela Bustamante, a former school teacher in the Philippines and a recent visitor in San Francisco, the new year brought the happiest moment of her life. She found her long missing twin brother, Adolfo, who left the islands 30 years ago and was never heard from since. It was a dream come true.


""I'd given up hope of ever seeing him again,"" she said during an interview at her brother's residence in the Sunset district of San Francisco.


""It was like a miracle,"" she added, and went on to relate how she ended up in San Francisco after visiting New York City, where she attended an International Teachers' conference held last April. From New York she went to Washington D.C. to inquire from the Philippine Embassy on the whereabouts of Adolfo, who came to the United States in 1950 as an exchange student at Georgetown University. But no one at the embassy ever heard of her brother.


Adela looked for her brother in Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles.


""I know there are thousands of my kababayan living in San Francisco and elsewhere in the Peninsula, but it never occured to me that I might find my twin brother here. I flew to San Francisco from Los Angeles for my return trip to Manila to rest at the home of a friend I met in New York. My friend lives in the Sunset district.


""I arrived in San Francisco on Dec. 22, just three days before Christmas after I had stayed in a cheap motel in L.A. feeling so downhearted. While I was in San Francisco, my friend persuaded me to stay until after Three Kings, Jan. 5, which we celebrate in the islands. I am alad I did.


""On Jan. 6 I was all set to take the first available plane bound for Manila. About 10 o'clock that morning I stood on the corner of 19th Avenue and Noriega and hailed a passing Yellow Cab. At first glance, I thought the driver was a woman with rather short curly hair. I saw the driver from the back. But when I boarded the cab I was surprised to see a man with dark mustache and beard wearing dark sunglasses.


""I looked at his face as he turned to talk to me, but I figured he was a total stranger. He appeared like an American of mixed blood to me, kind of Spanish type. 'San Francisco International Airport,' I said, eyeing him steadily.


""As he started driving, we fell to talking. 'You're new in San Francisco? . . . asked, looking at my face in the rear view mirror. There must be something in my face that made him look long. It couldn't be my new hat which I was wearing slightly tilted to the left, nor my custommade purplish colored sun glasses. I felt that people who knew me would have a hard time recognizing my face at a glance.


""Yes, I'm new in the city,' I said, adding, ""I spent the New Year with a friend.""


""You from Manila, Ma'am?"" he sounded so polite. ""It's a beautiful city -- isn't it?""


""You bet. I've lived there most of my adult life, but I'm not from Manila.""


""'Oh? Where you from?'""


""'Zamboanga City,' I said.""


""'What?' he turned to look at my face. 'You from Zamboanga?'""


""I nodded, smiled.""


""The next thing I knew, he started talking to me in chabacano, the dialect spoken in Zamboanga City, which the Spaniards called 'Ciudad de las flores,' city of flowers. You see, chabacano is a kind of slang Spanish which was said to have originated in Andalucia, Spain. I was dumbfounded because I never thought he could speak chabacano, my own dialect. Besides, I thought he was an American.


""I asked him if he had been to Zamboanga, and he surprised me even more when he said that he was a native of that city. 'In fact,' he emphasized, 'I was born there.'


""What?"" I stared at him. ""You're a Zamboanganeo? You're Filipino then?""


'Yes,' he nodded. 'I'm a full blooded Filipino although I've Spanish ancestors. I've a Spanish-sounding-name Adolfito Bustamante.'


""I thought I didn't hear right, so I asked, 'What's that?'


""'Adolfito Bustamante. It sounds Spanish, doesn't it?' he chuckled.


""Adolfito? You're my brother, my twin brother, Adolfo!' I said, my voice croaking.


""'Are you Adela Bustamante?' he asked, stopping the car.


""I choked, nodding. 'Y-yes-s Yes! You are my twin brother!' I repeated.


""He burst into tears. He stepped out of the driver's seat and went to hug me, crying like a small child. 'Oh, Sis, forgive me for not writing to you or Mom,' he said repeatedly.


""We had a tearful but happy reunion,"" she concluded.


Adela postponed her trip to Manila indefinitely. She said she wanted to stay a little longer with her newly found twin brother, lest she might lose him again.


""I'm very grateful to my friend who asked me to stay in her place until New Year, or I would have never found my missing twin brother,"" she said with a broad smile.

SEATTLE -- Police have yet to find the third suspect in the Wah Mee massacre of one year ago, but fear they may soon have a more immediate problem on their hands, according to Associated Press.


Vietnamese youths show signs of forming gangs.


Lt. Robert Holter told AP that three loosely formed groups of Vietnamese youths have reportedly been involved in extortions of shops and restuarants in the International District.


""We're concerned that there be no hostile interaction between groups,"" Holter added. ""There is some concern on our part that we would not like to have anyone stake out 'turf' or take over areas.""


But a social services worker disagreed on the seriousness of the threat of gangs.


""There are some teenagers flexing their muscles every once in a while, but there is no organized gang yet,"" said Bob Santos, director of the International District Improvement Association. ""I think the police and the community have a handle on it.""


The worries over Vietnamese youths surfaced one year after 13 persons were shot to death in a Chinatown gambling club. Two men were convicted for murder in that case, but a third suspect has eluded authorities.


Police said all their leads as to the whereabouts of Tony Ng, wanted in connection with the massacre, have led to naught.


Ng was last reported seen in Vancouver, British Columbia a few days after the shootings.


Meanwhile, merchants in the International District said business hit a bad slump after the massacre, but that it has improved as the incident fades from the public memory.


One merchant from New York recently opened a new business in the district, seemingly unconcerned about the area's reputation after Wah Mee. Crime is 10 times worse in New York, he was reported as saying.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Sixteen-year-old Tiffany Chin of Toluca Lake, Calif. won standing ovations and a berth on the U.S. Olympic team following a stunning performance that surprised many at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships held here last weekend.


Placing second in the national championships, Chin beat 1982 world champion Elaine Zayak and nearly upset reigning world champion Rosalynn Sumners. Sumners finished first and Zayak third in the week-long competition.


""I think Tiffany has shown everyone it's not just a two-way contest between Elaine and me,"" Sumners told a USA Today reporter. The three top finishers will be representing the U.S. at the Winter Olympics at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia in February.


It is likely that Chin would have won the competition save a fourth-place showing in the compulsory figures. The former world junior champion won the short and long freestyle competitions.


""I'm really pleased (with my results),"" said an elated Chin after the finals Saturday. ""It really made me feel good to place among the world champions.""


She added that making the Olympic team is ""what I've been working for all year long.""


However, she remains modest about her chances at the international competition next month.


""My main goal is really to be the 1988 Olympic champion. I'm planning to go there (Yugoslavia) and make a really good impression on everyone and make my marks.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Even though she has only been in The City for a few months, Sabrina Chan feels very much at home here.


""San Francisco is a, very interesting place -- an American city with an Asian influence,"" said the Hong Kong native. ""When I'm in Chinatown, I feel like I'm back at home!""


Chan recently joined Redwood Bank here as vice president and chief of staff after spending 10 years at Citibank in Hong Kong and three years with the same bank in New York.


Born in Guangzhou province, China, Chan studied economics and accounting at the University of Hong Kong and joined Citibank in 1968. She served as a planning officer, customer service officer, branch manager and manager of a network of 12 branches during her 10-year stint at the Hong Kong office.


""It was a challenging opportunity for me when I was accepted by one of the biggest banks,"" she recalled, ""especially as a woman in Asia.""


""I feel that banking is a good career for women because it is a service profession involving a great deal of 'people interaction.' I believe that women generally have good intuition in dealing with people. For me, I enjoy dealing with people from all walks of life and in turn, it is customer understanding that builds banks.""


Four years ago Chan was transferred to the New York office of Citibank, where she was named chief of staff to the Bronx Area director and put in charge of 21 branches. She then moved on to manage seven branches in Westchester County, and was made chief of staff to the business manager in charge of marketing financial packages.


At Redwood Bank she has the responsibility of marketing financial services to the Asian market.


""The Asian market is a goldmine,"" Chan said. ""Asians have developed good habits as savers and are highly competitive businesspeople.""


""Redwood is able to participate in the growth of the Asian community by providing top quality and personal service. A bank's success depends on how much it understands is customers' needs, and we give them choices (in financial services) that they're comfortable with.


""We're not trying to be a giant in the banking field. Rather, our motto is that we're large enough to serve you but small enough to know you.'""


Chan herself speaks several Chinese dialects, including Cantonese, Chiuchow, Mandarin and Fukien, and feels that this will be an asset in dealing with the Chinese community.


The bank also plans to hold a ""Chinese name contest"" to come up with a suitable Chinese name for Redwood.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A Chinese American delegate for Sen. Gary Hart in the Presidential primary election here next Tuesday criticized former Vice President Walter Mondale for not including any Asian candidates on his slates of delegates in San Francisco.


""I think it is very significant that Mondale's slates of delegates for the 5th and 6th Districts -- San Francisco -- have no Asian Americans on them,"" commented Clifford Lee, a delegate for Hart in the 5th District, as he passed leaflets at Union Square before a Hart speech last Saturday.


Lee is a member of the Chinese American Democratic Club, which recently endorsed Hart.


""We were impressed by Hart's positions on immigration, bilingual balloting and education,"" Lee said.


""But, basically, I think we were most impressed by the access Hart has given to Asian Americans. He met with us during a very hectic campaign schedule, and took time to listen to our concerns. And while committees have worked up positions for other candidates, Hart personally wrote a letter responding to issues of concern to our community."" (See Asian Week, 4/20/84.)


About 4,000 people packed Union Square to see Hart on Saturday, May 26.


Former newscaster Christine Craft, who has become a national symbol of the fight for equal pay and rights for women, served as M.C. for the rally. Rock singer Stephen Bishop provided entertainment.


One of the many speakers giving support to Hart at the . . . was Yori Wada, president of the Board of Regents for the University of California.


""I don't think the present administration has any right to stay in office after what it has done to higher education in California and throughout this country. It's a disgrace,"" Wada charged.


When Hart took the Stage, education was one of the first issues he addressed.


""Our vision includes creating the best training and education system in the world. When I debate Ronald Reagan next fall and he asks, 'Senator Hart, how are you going to pay for it?', I will say, 'Mr. Reagan, by canceling the MX missile and the B-1 bomber,'"" Hart said.


""We must not give this President four more years to turn his back on civil rights for minorities and women,"" Hart said.


Hart said that by trimming unnecessary spending from the defense budget, ""we'll be able to give retired citizens the kind of retirement they have earned.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Tragedy struck the Southeast Asian refugee community of the Tenderloin last weekend when the crushed body of eight-year-old Toan Van Vu was found at the bottom of an elevator shaft in the residential hotel where his family lived.


The boy's parents had reported him missing last Saturday afternoon. The manager of the hotel, while searching for the boy finally found him at the bottom of the elevator shaft Sunday morning, according to the S.F. Examiner.


Rolice believe the boy was playing on the fourth floor landing and became stuck between the inner and outer doors of the elevator. Then, when someone unwittingly pushed the elevator button, the boy was crushed as the elevator rose, and then he fell to his death at the bottom of the shaft at the El Cerrito Hotel at 270 Turk St.


A number of residents of the hotel told the Examiner that children often played in the elevators for lack of any other play area.

LOS ALTOS, CA -- The Republican Party must guard against the use of racial slurs if it wishes to reach out to more ethnic minorities, warned a prominent Asian American leader here.


Dr. Roger S.C. Eng, city councilman and former mayor of this suburb in the San Francisco Bay Area, cited an incident regarding the National Review as an example of the political fallout that can occur from the use of a single slur.


On the front cover of its May 4 edition, the National Review, edited by William F. Buckley Jr., used the world ""Chink"" in an illustration for an article about ""The Underhandedness of Affirmative Action.""


Linda Bridges, assistant managing editor, said the editorial board of National Review was unaware that the slur would be considered offensive. In a ""checklist"" of other minority groups in the illustration, no other group was characterized by such a slur.


""I strongly protest your blatant and insensitive use of the derogatory term for Americans of Chinese ancestry,"" Eng wrote to the magazine. ""Your claim of ignorance is entirely unacceptable and inexcusable.""


""Your actions have complicated matters in our efforts to recruit more Chinese Americans into the Republican Party. Our culture and heritage are more aligned with the Republican philosophies and thus enrollment should be an easy matter once this is pointed out to (Chinese Americans). The Democratic Party has promised us much but delivered little. The time was ripe, but your actions have become a detriment and a setback to our efforts,"" he wrote.


Eng is the president of the Santa Clara County chapter of the Chinese American Republican Assn and a member of the state Republican Central Committee.


In the storm of protest following the magazine's use of the slur, a large number of Chinese American activists seized upon Buckley's political background and said the use of the slur reflected insensitivity on the part of conservatives in general.


Eng told Asian Week he hadn't been subjected to the insult of the term ""Chink"" since the days of World War II, and was shocked to see the word on the cover of a national magazine.


But he said the use of racial slurs is becoming commonplace again.


""During the Olympics ABC was interviewing an American wrestler who had just beaten a Japanese wrestler. He said, 'The Jap wrestled just the way I thought he would.' Can you believe people are still using that word for Japanese in this day and age?""


Eng said that such slurs are the fault of individuals rather than political parties, and are more common in areas of the country which do not have large concentrations of Asian Americans. But he warned that the use of a slur will reflect not only on the individual who utters it but also on the party of which he is a member.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Pat Lee and Young Shin, delegates to the recent United Nations Women's Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, will be presenting slides of conference highlights at the Chinatown YWCA, 965 Clay St., on Thursday, Sept. 12, at 7 p.m. The program is co-sponsored by Asan Women United and the Chinatown YWCA. Admission is free.


Both Lee and Shin were participants of Forum '85, an alternative non-governmental conference to the official UN End of Decade Women's Conference. Forum delegates were sponsored by a Funding Exchange/Ford Foundation grant to represent the interests of low-income and minority women. Lee is union representative for Local 2 in San Francisco and Shin is director of the Asian immigrant Women's Project in Oakland.


While 2,000 women gathered in the official conference to develop strategies for advancing equality, development and peace for women worldwide, 8,000 women at Forum '85 tackled issues such as apartheid in South Africa, multi-national corporations, sex tourism and immigration.


""The NGO (Non-Governmental Organizations) conference was freer to talk about political issues,"" said Lee, ""Official delegates like Maureen Reagan chose to concentrate on domestic violence instead of taking on hard issues such as U.S. foreign policy and the Palestine question.""


On one hand, both Lee and Shin found the conference frustrating because of the lack of structure, orientation and consensus among the delegates. On the other hand, the conference proved to be both fascinating and stimulating.


""The conference broadened my understanding of the common problems facing women all over the world,"" said Shin. ""Women are not only affected by sex discrimination in their own communities, but also by the impact of the global economy.""


For example, she continued, when multi-national corporations move their factories to Asian countries where labor is cheaper, it affects the lives of women in those countries as well as the employment situation for Asian women in the United States.


""We need to begin networking with women in Asia and other parts of the world to ensure decent wages and working conditions for everyone employed by these multi-natiorial corporations,"" added Lee.


In addition to sharing their overall impressions of Nairobi and the conference at the slide show Sept. 12. Lee and Shin will be discussing conference issues of particular concern to Asian American women, including the impact of the global economy on women immigrant workers and sex tourism. Immigrant women workers as well as those interested in women issues are encouraged to attend.

PHOENIX -- It has been 10 years since Prof. Tien Wei Yang lost his job as a research associate at the University of Arizona, but his fight for reinstatement goes on.


Yang's position was terminated in what he claims was a case of personal antagonism and anti-Asian sentiments from other faculty members, and a denial of Yang's academic freedom.


Dr. Newell A. Younggren, then the head of the Biological Sciences Dept. at the University of Arizona, frequently complained of Dr. Yang's ""Oriental mentality"" and said he was difficult to work with before terminating Yang's position in June 1975. Dr. Younggren's remarks were confirmed in a discussion with the then Dean of the college of Liberal Art, Dr. Hermann Bleibtreu, by Dr. Charles Lowe, who had also sought Dr. Yang's ouster.


Younggren's and Lowe's personal disputes with Yang arose from disagreements over the academic content of one of Yang's classes, and also from help Yang was giving two graduate students working under the other two professors, according to Robyn Brown Hoffman, Yang's attorney.


Younggren reportedly said he wanted to get Yang removed from the department using any means available, according to remarks Lowe made before Dean Bleibtreu.


Yang's specialty is in research on plants that can survive in a desert environment. At the time of his dismissal 10 years ago, persons unknown destroyed a good many of his research plants in a university-owned field.


""These plants had been used for several years in my research,"" Yang told Asian Week in a telephone interview. ""Many of them were South American plants which I had grown from seed after my trips there.""


""The destruction of those plants was not just a matter of the university staff cleaning house. It was done deliberately,"" Yang charged.


During his 10-year battle for reinstatement Yang has fallen on hard times.


""For years I had practically no means of support,"" he said. ""I used up all my savings carrying on the legal battle.""


But, as the legal fight dragged on, Yang took a job teaching adults in the GED program, ""which is totally outside of my field,"" and continued his research without pay.


Yang field suit against the university in 1975 to regain his position. An attorney related to the university advised him the board of regents would not review his case for reinstatement as long as there was a suit pending, so Yang dropped if. But the regents never took up his case.


Yang's attorney is currently appealing to the UA board of regents to review Yang's case. The regents refused to put Yang on the agenda for a hearing this spring, but may allow him to present his arguments in the fall Hoffman said.


Yang's supporters are particularly upset that the regents denied his request for a hearing after he had dropped his law suit against the university. They say Yang agreed to drop the suit only because he had been assured the regents would give him a hearing.


""Dr. Yang right now is almost destitute. And knowing the kind of man he is, even if he had won some money from the university in his law suit, he probably would have given most of it away to charitable causes,"" commented Dr. Anthony Yeung, who himself has provided $4,000 toward Yang's legal expenses. ""He drives 60 miles to teach American Indians in the GED program a few hours each week, but other than that he has no income.""


Yeung said the local chapter of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance will appeal to the state's governor to intervene in Yang's case. The chapter will also ask support from the national CACA during its conference in Los Angeles this August.


Yeung is trying to form a committee to handle Yang's legal defenses. An apparatus had not been set up earlier because Yang had modestly tried to deal with the matter completely on his own.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Alan John Hu of La Jolla, Calif., won first place in the recent Westinghouse Science Talent Search, winning a $12,000 scholarship in the prestigious national competition.


Hu was one of six Asians who were among the 40 winners in the high school science contest. John Shu-Shin Kuo of Whitestone, N.Y., received the fifth prize of a $7,500 scholarship.


Other young science students who were awarded prizes were Junjiro Horiuchi of New York City, Leonard Tse-Yung Lee of Liverpool, N.Y., Bill L. Tsai of Northridge, Calif., and Paul Chan of Flushing, N.Y. They each received a $500 cash award.


The contest winners were honored at a ceremony held at the Mayflower Hotel here on March 4.


Conducted annually by Science Service, the Science Talent Search has been sponsored since its inception in 1942 by the Washing-house Educational Foundation and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. About $1.6 million have been given out to more the more than 1,600 prize winners through the years.


New York has produced the most winners in the history of the contest, with more than 500 of the state's students awarded prizes.


This is my life's greatest honor,"" first prize winner Alan Hu told World Journal. ""I'm very happy and excited.""


Hu, whose father is a professor of computer science at the University of California at San Diego, is originally from Taiwan.


""I am used to my son receiving awards,"" Hu's mother was quoted as saying. ""He has always done well in school and I'm not surprised. This is not the first time.""


She added that when she first heard that he had won the top prize, she called Hu's grandfather in Taiwan. The elder Hu has always taken a strong interest in his grandson's education.


John Kuo is another native of Taiwan. A student at the Bronx High School of Science, he came with his family to the U.S. when he was about nine years old.


His father is a physician in Taiwan while his mother works at a bank in New York's Chinatown.

BERKELEY -- The Philipino American Alliance of UC Berkeley held its annual cultural night Saturday, March 30 at the Pauley Ballroom on the UC campus.


It was an evening featuring cultural dances, songs and skits representing their theme for the evening, ""Dahil Sa Pag-ibig,"" or ""Because of Love.""


The show began with a scholarship presentation. Every year, each of three incoming Filipino freshmen is awarded a PAA scholarship in recognition of outstanding scholarship and community achievement.


""The scholarship presentation is a way to recognize incoming PAA members and their achievements,"" said Janet Uson, a member of the Scholarship Selection Committee. This year's $200 recipient was Leo Torio of Berkeley.


Following the scholarship presentation, emcees Al Bito and Evangeline Tano gave an introduction to the opening dances and skits. ""Our first skit will focus on the Muslim people and their first stage of courtship,"" said Bito. This lively enactment featured PAA members portraying a Filipino family going through the process of giving the consent to marriage for their daughter.


""Kailangan Ko, Kailangan Mo, (I need you, you need me)"" was sung next by the harmonious PAA singers.


""Next, the following Spanish Suite dances represents the types of formal dances held at cotillions and other festive events,"" the emcees said. The PAA members danced the Harbanera, a lively dance involving the flirting and the interaction of a young man and young woman. It is a lively dance which is mainly performed during courtship.


The Barrio Suite was characterized by the Pandanggo sa Ilaw, a dance involving the use of candles to represent fireflies, a common sight dring the harvest season. Ending the Barrio Suite was the Tinikling, one of the most renowned Filipino folk dances. It is a fast dance requiring much skill and agility of its dancers who step and turn between rapidly moving bamboo poles.


""Ending the show tonight will be the American Suite...the Filipino esteem is reflected in these dances of the '50s, '70s, and '80s,'"" said Tano. The 'sailors' of the '50s jitter-bugged their way across the stage, as John Travolta look-a-likes did the Night Fever. The Suite ended with a group of dancers doing the chacha, a contemporary dance among Filipinos today.


The evening's entertainment ended with a conglomeration of smiling faces in the PAA slideshow. ""This slide show displays the many activities PAA has been involved in throughout the year: ...the ski trip, FAWN Conference, APSU Conference and the trip to Delano to visit the manongs,"" said Aurora Walker and Joel Kabahit, narrators. ""The PAA has strived to maintain their goal of campus and community awareness.""

It seems to me that those who have both praised and criticized the film ""Dim Sum"" have failed to recognize its enormous significance.


We've waited a long time for this simple breakthrough: an honest movie about the Chinese American experience.


Hollywood's ""constructive engagement"" with stereotype has forced Chinese Americans, still burdened with a transitional second generation, to grope toward the American dream without the benefit of role models, cheated of the opportunity to be seen, heard and understood.


Wayne Wang, armed with a fresh vision, has created a movie that provides a glimpse at the strained relationships within a Chinese American home. A mother, daughter and uncle -- driven by duty, culture and unspoken love, each feel they must care for one another at the price of self sacrifice.


This movie provides Chinese Americans an opportunity to see that, however fragmented and unfathomable their lives may seem at times, there are others confronting the same issues, torn by the same emotions.


Many reviewers, even those who say they enjoyed the film, have complained that ""Dim Sum"" is flawed by long silences and a slow pace. They do not understand. Chinese Americans who watch the film will hear, within the silences, the private thoughts of conflicting generations. The silences come from the heart of the Chinese American vocabulary.


Chinese Americans will find scenes in the movie funny and revealing because the images and situations are real, fashioned from pieces of the quilt of their own lives.


Here, finally, we have a second generation Chinese American daughter, unmarried, in her 30s, still living at home, agonizing over responsibility to her aging mother and the pressures to marry.


Here, finally, we have a traditional Chinese mother, wanting her daughter to marry, but unwilling to let her go, unable to master English or understand her children. ""Mom's Chinese when she needs to be,"" the daughter explains. ""She's not going to change.""


Here, finally, we have a Chinese American uncle, with that peculiar combination of Chineseness and acquired American practicality you see in the aging generation of Chinatown men born in China, but bred in America, ""You can only keep what you can use,"" the uncle counsels the daughter.


And here, finally, we have a recognizable Chinese American home: dominated by the kitchen, television set and sewing machine, with shoes piled by the door, a laundry basket, Chinese movie magazines, cans of assorted biscuits on the kitchen table. The children -- who are no longer children -- speak to the mother in English, and the mother lectures them in Chinese. Silent meals and unspoken thoughts tenuously hold together these lives, separated by dreams and experience.


An auntie neighbor delivers a gift to the mother: a bottle of brandy. The mother, in turn, gives it to the uncle as a birthday gift. The uncle, who owns a Chinatown bar, recognizes a mark on the bottle: he had originally given the brandy to one of his customers. The brandy had made its way through the familiar Chinese gift circuit.


The daughter, helping her mother practice for the citizenship test, asks the name of the first president of the United States. ""What!"" the mother barks, in the befuddled manner of a Chinese mother. After several false starts, the mother finally says: ""Georgie Vassingtune.""


I have one small criticism: the Chinese mother depicted in the film wasn't combative enough, and, therefore, overt conflict and argument, part of the lexicon of second generation experience, were not adequately represented.


But this shortcoming was unavoidable. The authenticity of the film derives largely from the authenticity of the relationship between the two central characters, a real life mother and daughter, both non-professional actresses. It would have been unrealistic to expect the mother and daughter to live with the consequences of direct conflicts created for the screen.


We should now insist that Hollywood follow Wayne Wang's lead and create legitimate opportunities for Chinese American actors, actresses, writers and directors to tell more stories of the Chinese American experience.


""Dim Sum"" gave us a first taste of how much we've been shortchanged all these years.


""Dim Sum"" is playing at the Harvard Exit Theatre at Broadway and Roy. Call 323-8986 for show times.


Meanwhile, the Neptune Theatre continues its Chinese film festival with two movies from mainland China: ""The Herdsman"" and ""The Rickshaw Boy"" on Monday, October 21 at 6:30 p.m. Call 633-5545 for more information.

SAN JOSE -- Imagine a Chinese and English character computer which can transmit data across the Pacific via satellite. This would represents a tremendous breakthrough in trans-Pacific communication.


C.S. Ho, president of Mitac, a Taiwan based company, claims to have developed such a multilingual computer.


""Communicating by computer via satellite is nothing new,"" noted Ho, ""but being able to send data using Chinese characters is very new and represents a great advancement in technology.


""The system known as the 1660 Chinese character terminal took seven years of research and development,"" said Ho, ""and the product line has gone through its fourth generation already. To devise a multilingual computer system, we had to resort to a Simplex Input Method, which required a coding system for the complex Chinese characters and one for English within the terminal itself.""


""To transmit a message trans-Pacific is as easy as picking up your phone,"" claimed H.T. Tung, an engineer at the American Mitac Corp. located in Santa Clara. ""All one needs to do is to pick up a telephone, dial a code number, listen for a signal, and then type the message into the computer. When the other party receives the message within seconds, a signal is sent back to the sender to indicate receipt of the message. All this goes through the telephone satellite system.


""Not only is the computer also able to transmit both Chinese and English text in seconds, but it can also transmit graphics or patterns simultaneously,"" noted Tung.


According to Sterling Ho, an engineer consultant (unrelated to C.S. Ho), the 1660 Chinese character terminal has videotext capabilities as well. Videotext allows access to information stored in data banks in Taiwan, which can be reproduced in Chinese on the Mitac terminal at any given time via satellite.


""There are big benefits from the use of videotext,"" continued Ho, ""Just being able, for instance, to get investment information such as national policies regarding foreign investments into Taiwan could be very helpful for those overseas investors. Getting the information in its original Chinese context from the data bank would save investors from losing any of its meaning in translation from Chinese into English.""


Mitac was originally started by a group of engineers led by C.S. Ho. Subsequently, as time went on, it needed money for growth, and a financial institution in Taiwan and other investors bought part of the company.


""One person,"" said Ho, ""who has been largely responsible for the tremendous advancement of the company was Matthew Miao. Educated in the United States, he went to Intel in Santa Clara to work in their micro computer technology aspect of the business. When he left Intel to return to Taiwan, he became part of the venture capitalist group investing in Mitac. Not only did Miao bring into the company his financial capabilities, but he brought his business-experiences and his engineering technological know-how from Intel as well.""


Matthew Miao is now chairman of the company.


According to C.S. Ho, sales figure for Mitac this year has reached $120 million.


Yue-Loong, Motor Company, Taiwan's largest automobile manuacturer, used Mitac's CAD system to design the prototype of its new generation automobiles, which were completely designed by Chinese engineers.

For the last three decades, war after bloody war has been waged in the villages and jungles of Indochina. Wars of colonization; wars of reunification; wars of independence.


Through it all, the people still yearn for peace.


""All of us are a peace-loving people,"" said Cambodia's Prince Norodom Ranariddh on a visit to Seattle last week. ""We do not want to go on fighting just for the sake of making war.


""But we are a proud people,"" he continued, punctuating his words with animated gestures, ""so we could never accept, under any pretext, another country's occupation of our country.""


Urbane and articulate, Ranariddh is the 41-year-old son and personal representative of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former leader of Cambodia who now heads the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), consisting of the non-communist Sihanouk and Son Sann factions and the communist Khmer Rouge. Although the CGDK is recognized as the official government of Cambodia by the United Nations, the Hanoibacked Heng Samrin regime has been in power since 1979.


The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ostensibly to rid the people of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, who were responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.8 million Cambodians during its three-year reign. But the Vietnamese stayed on, installing a puppet government and moving in more troops. Now, according to the CGDK and its allies, they are intent on increasing their numbers through resettlement. In addition to the estimated 200,000 troops, tens of thousands of Vietnamese farmers and merchants are said to be moving into Cambodia's relatively unpopulated countryside and cities.


On November 6, the United Nations approved a resolution, by an overwhelming vote of 114 to 21, calling for the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia. Similar resolutions in past years have had little effect, but Prince Ranariddh doesn't believe Hanoi can continue to ignore world opinion. ""Vietnam is becoming more and more isolated,"" he said.


Ranariddh said his father is pushing for negotiations in the hope of establishing a government acceptable to everyone involved.


""We must dissolve our coalition government; Heng Samrin must also dissolve its government. We would then set up together the government of Cambodia.""


Neutrality, he stressed, is the ultimate goal. ""A Cambodia belonging to China is not a real solution because the Soviets and Vietnamese wouldn't accept that. If Cambodia remains a Vietnamese province or ally, China wouldn't accept that. There is no solution but a neutral Cambodia.""


A neutral Cambodia, however, may pose too much of a threat to the Vietnamese, who envision a tightly-knit, ideologically-unified Indochina. Earlier this month, Prince Sihanouk warned that the Vietnamese are preparing for a major dry-season offensive against Cambodian guerrillas along the Thai-Cambodian border.


Still, there are signs of conciliation. In September, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot announced his retirement, a move Hanoi had insisted upon as a precondition for negotiations. And Vietnam has appeared more amenable to the U.S., agreeing recently to disinter remains of Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.


Ranariddh is hopeful. ""Sooner or later, the Vietnamese have to sit down and talk. They know they cannot completely wipe out our resistance.""


The Prince, also the Supreme Commander of his faction's armed forces, was adamant about the need to maintain a military presence in his homeland: ""The military element must serve our political and diplomatic goals. Without it, we don't know if the Vietnamese would see a reason to negotiate.""


Wary of overseas involvement and domestic opposition, the United States has so far refused to give military aid to the Cambodian rebels, although $5 million in non-military aid was recently granted and millions more may have been given in covert aid.


Ranariddh passionately stated the case for increased American support, noting that Cambodians are ""fighting to defend the same principles cherished by the American people: independence and freedom.""


""If Cambodia would one day fall into Vietnamese or Soviet or Chinese hands,"" he went on, ""there will be no stability and peace in Southeast Asia because if Cambodia falls, it is a threat to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and maybe Indonesia.""


Above all else, Ranariddh is a realist. He knows the Cambodians can't beat the militarily superior Vietnamese on the battlefield. And he knows he must work with his erstwhile enemies, the Khmer Rouge, the largest and most powerful faction in the coalition, if any agreement is to be reached.


""Without the Khmer Rouge, there is no China. No China, no solution,"" he said, adding that his faction is allied with moderate Khmer Rouge -- ""not Pol Pot and his odious killers.""


The Prince was in the United States to visit the United Nations, U.S. officials in Washington D.C. and members of Cambodian communities in the U.S. He said he was particularly gratified by the support of overseas Cambodians, 7,000 of whom live in the Seattle area.


""We need them to support us,"" said Ranariddh, whose father is still extremely popular among his compatriots. ""We need them to help keep our problems in the minds of Americans. Without that, we will become like South Vietnam or Laos -- nobody talks about them anymore.""

Truth, it is often said, is stranger than fiction.


Nothing comes closer to that assertion than the existence of what is claimed to be the world's biggest and most fabulous pearl, weighing over 15 pounds and close to 14 inches in diameter. A pearl that size and weight is unquestionbly stranger than fiction, an incredible story that tickles the imagination.


It may surprise people to know that the first owner of this particular pearl was a Filipino, a former prison guard at San Quentin, who passed away some years ago. The pearl was kept inside a steel vault of a big bank in San Francisco. It had remained in the vault for years until it was sold at an auction to a rich antique collector at the high price of $200,000.


How did the subject of ""pearl"" come up, you might ask, unfolding an incredible story to an unbelieving world?


The answer could be traced to a birthday party at the home of a prosperous-looking Filipino couple in South City. The celebrant, a tall, stately looking lady, said to be distantly related to Imelda Marcos, the First Lady of the Philippines, was a most gracious host. Her guests consisted of some Americans, Chinese and mostly Filipinos, your correspondent included. We were gathered around the dining table on top of which lay all the good Filipino food you could think of -- lechon, pancit, lumpia fresca and lumpia frito, pork and chicken adobo, kare-kare, even diguan, a blood recipe, my grandfather's favorite, good with puto or rice cake. Set on another table were different kinds of dessert - leche plan, fruit jello, strawberry cake, lemon pie and such Filipino delicacies as cochinta, kalamay, made of kasaba flour, mahablanca, my favorite, matamis na ube, macapuno and langka, jack fruit. The drinks -- well, they were relatively mild, California wine. San Miguel beer, sparkling cider and of course, the ordinary soft drinks, Seven-Up and Coca-cola.


The subject of ""pearls"" spontantaneously came up and became the topic of conversation when three bejeweld, elegantly dressed Filipino laides, all in their mid-30s, began admiring each other's body ornamentations. One was wearing a three or four-carat diamond ring, a pearl necklace and diamond earrings. The second lady was wearing a pearl necklace with two strands around her neck, a ruby ring with smaller diamonds around it, and ruby earrings to match. The third lady who looked like she had dyed her hair to a shade of brown, had a pearl necklace with four strands of pearls adorning her neck that matched perfectly with her pearl earrings, a pearl ring and pearl necklace.


The lady with the diamond ring approached her, felt her necklace, and said, ""Say, these are beautiful pearls, look very expensive. Where did you get them?""


""Oh, my husband bought them in Japan. He travels to Tokyo twice a year. He's with the Merchant Marine, you know.""


The second lady also approached her, likewise felt her necklace and said, ""Oh, your pearls are bigger than mine. They're indeed beautiful. How much did you husband pay for them, do you know?""


""Oh, my husband gave me these pearls on our fourth wedding anniversary. Each strand represents a year of our marriage. I think he paid $4,000 for the necklace alone,"" she said proudly.


""Four thousand dollars? Wow!"" exclaimed the second lady, her eyes fixed on the third lady's necklace, and wishing she had four strands of pearl, too.


An American standing nearby, his plate filled with food, overheard their conversation and said, ""Four thousand dollars for four strands of pearls isn't bad. Did you ladies hear about a single pearl that was sold for $200,000?""


The lady with the diamond ring turned to him and said, ""Yeah, I kind of heard it, too. But I think the person who bought that pearl must be crazy or something. Probably he had so much money he didn't know where to put it.""


""I think so, too,"" agreed the two other ladies, speaking simultaneously. ""He must be a multi-millionaire obssessed with pearls.""


""What kind of pearl was it, do you know? I tell you the man who paid $200,000 for it was really out of his mind. You see, my diamond ring, a four-carat ring at that, didn't even come close to the price of that pearl you're talking about."" She raised her left hand and showed the American the ring on her index finger.


The American took a good look at it and said, ""Gee, that's a very pretty ring. It must have cost you a fortune.""


""Oh, not really. But this pearl you're talking about is beyond me beyond anyone's imagination. Who can ever believe that a pearl, a single pearl -- would cost $200,000. It's pure fiction. Don't you think so?""


The other two nodded in quiet agreement. The one wearing two strands of pearl necklace said, ""What kind of a pearl was it anyway? How does it look?""


""Oh, you won't believe it,"" answered the American. ""It isn't round and smooth as a pearl should be, but rugged, irregular, grotesque in shape. But it's big, bigger than my head, and weighs over 15 pounds.""


""Oh, come on. You're kidding.""


""Oh, no, no,"" the American quickly retorted, shaking his head. ""I ain't kidding you, ladies. It's true. It was in the newspapers. I understand the news of the existence of this very rare pearl even appeared in the New York Times.""


""Granted that there is such a pearl,"" the lady with the diamond ring said, ""but the price of $200,000 is really beyond me. That's too much.""


""Wait until you hear what one wealthy Chinese businessman from Hong Kong offered to buy the pearl,"" the American said with a light chuckle.


""Oh? What did he offer?"" they all asked, staring with knitted brows at the American.


""Believe it not, $3 million.""


""What? Three million dollars? That's pure fantasy!"" cried all three of them.


""He must be another crazy guy to make such an offer on a single pearl,"" laughed the lady with the diamond ring.


""No matter what the reason is, I won't pay a million bucks for a pearl if I were a millionaire,"" said the lady wearing four strands.


""What could be the important reason the Chinese offered to buy the pearl for $3 million, do you know?"" asked the lady with the diamond ring. ""Now don't tell me it's the size of the pearl, which you said is as big as your head, or its weight of over 15 pounds. We already know that.""


""I know you do,"" the American said. ""No, it isn't the size nor the weight of the pearl.""


""What is it then?""


He took another puff on his cigarette before he said, ""There is something so strange about this pearl, you know. Something so mystifying and unbelieveable -- the image of three men, I mean, faces which have been ascertained as belonging to the three great philosophers, Lao Shen, Buddha and Confucius! Their faces are discernable, reflected on the surface of the pearl.""


The three Filipino ladies looked at each other in disbelief, and shook their heads. One asked, ""Is it really true?""


The American nodded. ""Believe it or not. It is true!""

SAN FRANCISCO -- A Vietnamese refugee living here thanked God and promised to help poor people after the hit the $2 million jackpot in the state lottery this week.


Hai Vo spun the wheel in the televized state lottery jackpot game Monday night and became San Francisco's newest millionaire. A resident of a less-than-elegant section of the South of Market district, he indicated he would like to move out of the neighborhood, buy a home -- or perhaps buy an apartment house and become a landlord himself.


Vo and his wife Nquven Thi Nhu fled Vietnam in a crowded boat in 1979 and spent two years in a refugee camp before coming to the U.S. He is now studying English.


Vo was living on welfare benefits and said he spent $200 on lottery tickets before getting his lucky winner. Asian American community leaders feared many other low-income refugees would gamble themselves into worse poverty trying to duplicate Vo's good luck.


Vo has been studying English and is enrolled in a computer repair program, according to one news report.

SAN YSIDRO -- Despite a growing trend toward a ""U.N. of illegals at (the) Mexico border,"" illegal aliens from Asian countries entering the U.S. at the southern border represent barely a trickle compared to the flood from other nations.


A growing number of what the Border Patrol calls ""OTMs"" -- other than Mexicans -- are trying to enter the U.S. illegally at the southern boundary, reported John Flinn of the San Francisco Examiner.


But figures showing the number of aliens seized by the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol since 1984 indicate relatively few Asians are entering the U.S. by that route.


Only 3.6 percent, 452 out of a total 12,690 arrested came from Asian countries.


The largest number from any single Asian country came from India, with 158, followed by South Korea with 156. Third was China with 55, and most others had fewer than 10.


The greatest numbers of illegal aliens arrested at the border came from El Salvador (6, 152), Guatemala (2,936) and Nicaragua (723).

SAN FRANCISCO -- The final showdown was expected this week on the controversial Jackson Court/Pineview construction project proposed for Stockton Street in Chinatown.


As they looked forward to the project's hearing at the Planning Commission on Thursday, May 2, tension mounted between developers of the project and tenants currently living at the site, who face eviction if the project is approved.


The Pineview portion of the project proposes an 11-story building with 70 units of housing for senior citizens, subsidized by the federal department of Housing & Urban Development. Almost no opposition has been voiced to the Pineview proposal.


However, opponents claim the Jackson Court portion at 1055 Stockton St. would destroy the character of Chinatown, turning Stockton Street into an even more congested area which would cater to tourists rather than local residents.


The Jackson Court building would hold 36 market rate condominiums and approximately 82,900 gross square feet of commercial retail space, plus residential open space and subterranean parking. Opponents say the building would triple the amount of retail space currently used by the 13 businesses at the site.


Numerous critics of the proposal have compared it to the International Hotel, the Chinatown site of the notorious battle between tenants and law officials in 1977. I-Hotel tenants were forcibly evicted in the wee hours of the morning as demonstrators protested outside.


Critics have tried to force the proposal to be split in two so that the commercial portion could be delayed or denied without endangering the senior housing project.


The developers, however, maintain that the two buildings are inextricably linked and that Pineview could not possibly be built without Jackson Court.


Overshadowing all the debate is the worry that HUD might withdraw its offer of subsidies for the Pineview project.


Anni Chung, executive director of Self-Help for the Elderly, claims that HUD will withdraw its support if approval for the project is not given before May 15. Without the HUD monies; she said, the entire project must be scrapped.


Opponents claim that HUD could easily grant an extension on its deadline for approval.


Observers noted that a compromise between the developers and tenants would hinge on whether replacement housing would be provided for those evicted. The developers have offered to subsidize the rents of individual tenants for up to 20 years if they remain in Chinatown, but critics are demanding that actual housing units be subsidized for 20 years whether the individual tenants remain or not.


Apparently anticipating a marathon session of debate over the project, the Planning Commission placed it on the agenda for 1 p.m. but added that at 3:30 p.m. the debate would be recessed until the rest of the agenda had been completed. One man familiar with Chinatown planning issues predicted the meeting might stretch late into the night.

SEOUL -- If you asked Korean dissdent leader Kim Dae Jung how old he is, he would probably ask you, ""Before 1945, or after?""


Like many Korean men who were in their late teens during the 1910-1945 period of Japanese rule, Kim has two ages.


His official birthday, reports the Associated Press, is noted on registry papers and other legal documents as Dec. 3, 1925, which makes him 59 years old However, he was actually born on Jan. 6, 1924, and is 61 years old.


When I was nearing 20 years of age ""Kim explained, ""we were under Japanese rule and I didn't want to go into the Japanese army. So I reduced my age and succeeded in not being conscripted.


""Before I reached 20 by that count, Japan had surrendered at the close of the war,"" he added.


Japan had annexed the Korean peninsula in 1910 and placed it under colonial rule until the end of World War II in 1945. Many Koreans falsified their records to avoid serving in the Japanese military.

During the establishment of the Meiji era in modern Japan (1867) a brutal and decisive war took place between the clans of the north who supported the Shogun, and the clans of the south who backed the Emperor. The Wakamatsu Clan led by Lord Katamori Matsudaira was defeated in November 1868. The Wakamatsu castie (200 miles northeast of Tokyo) fell into enemy hands and the city was reduced o rubble.


John Henry Schnell, a German confident of Lord Matsudaira, suggested that the Lord do what European political leaders did in similar circumstances, move to America and rebuild his fortunes. Schnell was given the authority to lead the advance party and the ""Wakamatsu Tea and Siek Farm Colony"" was formed with the designation in the Gold Hill near Placerville. California. The Wakamatsu Colony was composed of a few samurai, farmers, some in the trades and four women. They arrived in 1869. They purchased 600 acres in what is El Dorado County today in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and brought along silk worms, mulberry trees, bamboo shoots, lacquer plants and tea seedlings. (See NISEI BY Bill Hosokawa, William Morrow Co. New York, 1969, 31-33) The agricultural experiment failed and the colony was disbanded in 1871.


Yoshiko Uchida, a renowned Nisei authoress who wrote over 20 books, used this historical background for ""Samurai of Gold Hill."" Although the characters are fictional, the background is authenic. Readers of Asian Week can recall that I wrote the review of her book ""Desert Exile: The Uprooting of a Japanese American Family"" in the 8/26/82 issue. Ms. Uchida is able to use a harsh historical background to develop a human and delightful story that present-day readers will understand and appreciate; once you start on her book, it will be difficult to put it down until completion.


""Samurai of Gold Hill"" is different from ""Desert Exile."" ""Samurai,"" though based on history, is a fictional story, while ""Desert Exile"" is a sociological and historical experience of a Japanese American family during the World War II evacuation of the Japanese people and Japanese Americans in the Western states.


The Wakamatsu Colony went from Sacramento to Placerville in 1869; I traveled the same route in 1933-40 enroute to the Chinese Christian Youth Conference at Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The route taken by J. Henry Schnell in Coloma, El Dorado County, was also a familar route for me. The time frame was about a century apart, but the Sierra Nevada Mountains did not change much throughout the centuries.


As I read Ms. Yoshiko Uchida's ""Samurai of Gold Hill"" which I shall review for the readers of Asian Week in the next issue, I am wondering out loud, why did Henry Schnell choose this territory for his scheme of the Wakamatsu Colony experiment? Did he know the rugged country when he led this band of sturdy farmers from Japan? Did he know the harsh winters and the humid summers of the Sierra Nevada mountains? This was not the rich agriculture land that the Wakamatsu Clan left in Northeast Japan for the terrain and the high mountains of California's rugged Sierra.


What would the historian say today if the Wakamatsu Colony stopped in the rich agricultural land of Sacramento Valley instead of pushing to the Sierra Nevada in 1869? It was not until the early 1900s that the Japanese farmers discovered the ""black gold"" of central California and became pioneers in the agricultural development in that region. Would Asian American history be different in the 20th Century if the Wakamatsu Colony stayed in Sacramento instead of pushing on to Placerville and Coloma? This is another one of those ""what if"" stories of the Asian Americans in California.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Superivsor Bill Maher, who was out on Local 2's picket line at the Commercial Club in support of its mainly Chinese American workers, turned up in tuxedo at the ""State of the Arts Alive!"" benefit for the Asian American Theater Company at the Asian Art Museum, Saturday, Nov. 16.


""This is really exciting,"" he enthused. Asian Americans have battled for access to jobs and basic civil rights, and now such events as this benefit represent ""the beginning of community development of modern Asian American culture"" rather than solely dwelling on the cultural past.


Maher spoke of his delight in seeing Laureen Chew in ""Dim Sum."" ""I used to register voters with her in Chinatown.""


""I see myself as a representative of the Chinese community,"" he stated emphatically.


What will be his attitude toward Tom Hsieh if the latter runs against him as a candidate for the Board of Supervisors next year?


Maher does not regard Hsieh as a rival. ""There are five seats on the board to be voted on next year.""


""I hope that we will have a Chinese American representative on the board and I think we're getting close to it.""

Recently Frank and Julie Augustin were arrested for smugling military aircraft parts to Iran, a country barred from purchasing American military hardware because of a trade embargo. The Augustins are Filipinos, Frank a recent immigrant by way of Canada, and Julie an active member of San Diego's Filipino community.


The alleged actions of such people hurt all Asian Americans. We live in a time of increasing racial prejudice.


In recent years there has been in a growing clamor in this country to limit imports from the Far East and also to limit immigration from that region. Well-publicized charges like those against the Augustins only add fuel to the fire. There used to be a time when I could drive a week in Los Angeles without seeing a bumper sticker that read ""Buy American"" or had some other racist message, Nowadays, sometimes I can't go two days without seeing a racist bumper sticker.


Many people have blamed America's increasing trade deficit as the cause for the increasing prejudice against Asian Americans. Perhaps there is also another reason. Perhaps it is the changing attitudes of some of the recent immigrants from the Far East.


There used to be a time when things were different. As an example, a generation ago no Japanese American was ever convicted of espionage. Herbert Nicolson, a Quaker minister who fought for the release of Japanese Americans from the World War II detention camps, notes that fact in his recent book, Comfort All Wlio Mourn.


How times have changed. Nowadays we read about spy scandals and gang activity in our newspapers. I've heard that Cambodian youth gangs have become a problem in some parts of Northern California.


We Asian Americans who have been here longer cannot delude ourselves into thinking that the actions of our more recently arrived countrymen will not affect us. It will Most Caucasians cannot tell one Asian ethnic group from another. I am of Japanese decent but have often been mistaken for Chinese. We've got to help this new wave of immigrants assimilate. If we don't, all of us will pay the price.

Actor Robert Ito, best known for his role on ""Quincy,"" is starring in a Canadian television drama, ""The Exile,"" about the experiences of Japanese Canadians during World War II. Ito plays Ken Nakashima, a husband and father in his 50s, who has tried to suppress all painful memories of his wartime experiences.


The past is brought back when his elderly father returns from Japan after 40 years to visit the grave of Ken's mother. Ken is forced to recall his mother's death in the internment camp when his own son begins to question the past.


For Ito, the film ""brought back a lot of bad memories"" of his own wartime experiences. Ito spent four years in the camp at Tashme where much of the film is set. ""The Exile"" marks the first time in 20 years Ito has worked in Canada, where he began his career as a dancer/ soloist with the National Ballet of Canada.


The Neptune Theater has two programs of note in its early December line-up. On December 9, ""Dersula Uzala"" and ""Rashomon,"" two award-winning films by Akira Kurosawa, will be shown.

In a serious lapse of taste, the Neptune is also pairing ""Year Of The Dragon"" with ""Rambo: First Blood Part II."" It's a dream double-feature for masochists and racists.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Henry L.M. Kei joined Asian Yellow Pages as president, announced Jim Stein, president of Direct Language Publishing, Inc., parent company of the San Francisco-based bilingual yellow page directory. AYP publishes bilingual directories in Chinese/English and Japanese/English.


Kei, 36, a native of China, is a noted business executive with over 12 years' corporate experience within the Bay Area business community.


""The Asian Yellow Pages has grown in the past three years to a $2 million division with more than 30 employees,"" Stein claimed.


""We have reached the point where we need to move from an entrepreneurial mode to a more corporate approach. It's time for the entrepreneurs to move over and let the financial and corporate wizards take over.


""Henry Kei comes from a strong cororate background. He has the business understanding and the training in finance essential to make our transition solid and positive,"" Stein said.


""It will be quite a challenge for me to follow in Jim's footsteps."" said Kei.


""I intend to build on the solid foundation that Jim has laid. Business owners are learning that the Asian Yellow Pages will give them access to an Asian American market that's 500,000 strong -- a tremendously lucratic market composed people who speak English well, but prefer to read in their native tongue.


""Seventy-two percent of AYP's advertisers are non-Asian business-owners,"" Kei stated. ""That's clear evidence the book is a bridge between cultures that benefits its advertisers and users alike.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- As the members of the Orangeland Tenants Association prepared this week to celebrate the organization's 30th anniversary, their fight to stay in their homes was seen as one which could decide the future of all Chinatown.


The tenants are threatened with eviction if The City gives approval to a large construction project at Stockton and Jackson Streets. The project proposal, in its present form, includes plans for market-rate commercial and housing units, as well as a high-rise building supplying 70 subsidized housing units for senior citizens. The federal government has agreed to give a $3.6 million loan for construction of the seniors housing complex.


But the project would displace the 195 tenants currently living at the site, as well as 13 neighborhood-serving businesses, Critics also charge that the project would add more traffic to the already heavy congestion on Stockton Street.


Self-Help for the Elderly, one of some 38 social service agencies serving residents in Chinatown, is sponsoring the Pineview senior housing project, in conjunction with Georo Development, Inc., developers of the commercial section of the proposal.


S.F. Chronicle reporter L.A. Chung wrote this week that the controversy over the proposal is symbolic of the fight over the future of Chinatown.


Will Chinatown, sitting on some of the most valuable property in The City, be given over to development or will it retain its historic role as the oldest and most prominent home of the Chinese in America?


Next to the financial district and very near to Union Square, Chinatown property is fetching prices as high as $200 per square foot from Chinese investors in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Chung reported.


About 70 percent of the buildings in the district were built before World War II, and many fall short of safety codes. Officials have told Asian Week that, in the event of a major earthquake, Chinatown faces a huge catastrophe.


The district's population of 35,000 live in about 6500 housing units, 60 percent of which are one-room residential hotel units, Chung reported.


But Chinatown plays three vital roles, according to studies by the Planning Department. It is a residential village, the capital city for the Chinese in America, and also one of the most popular tourist attractions of San Francisco. To tamper with its historic role as a residential village might harm its value in the other two roles.


How much of old Chinatown can you cling to?"" asked Anni Chung, executive director of Self-Help for the Elderly and the leading proponent for the construction project, in an interview with Asian Week. ""Chinatown needs balanced growth. If you don't want any development at all, just say so instead of making insinuations, like, 'Yes we are in favor of building senior housing but we are not in favor of any development.'""


One major worry about the proposed development is that it is being funded by overseas interests from either Hong Kong or Taiwan.


The site of the project is owned by the Lee family and has been for decades. Attorney Richard Lim is also listed as a principal for Georo Development.


""There is absolutely no foreign money involved. Mrs. Lee and her family own it pure and clear,"" Anni Chung said.


The worries about foreign capital were fueled by the fact that various real estate interests in The City, who had options to join the venture, had previously been rumored to be conduits for large amounts of foreign capital coming into San Francisco real estate. Those interests options have expired, however, according to a knowledgable source. That source said he was unaware of any other ""Hong Kong connection"" in regard to the project.


The question facing the rest of Chinatown, aside from the individual case of the Orange-land Tenants, is whether the old buildings of the district should be preserved and brought up to safety code (at a cost of $30 per square foot, Chung reported) or torn down to make way for newer, higher-density buildings.


According to recent studies, San Francisco has the fourth highest population density of cities in the U.S., with an average of 75 people per residential acre. Chinatown's average is reportedly 744 people per residential acre, nearly 10 times the citywide figure. Allowing higher-density buildings in Chinatown would exacerbate the social problems of the district, critic charge.

Some columns are fun to write -- my travels, the parties of jovial friends, the births of new babies. Some are inspiring -- the feats of bright young students, the birthday celebrations of healthy active senior citizens. Some are of happy times when friends reunite, families get together, marriages occur, young adults finish their studies and idealistically begin their careers. Some are of sad times when friends leave us for far-away places or the Great Beyond.


Today's column is dedicated to three of my favorite people who have given happiness to those who were blessed with their friendship, and who have always been special friends for their kindness and caring for their fellow man.


Bill Toy was a beloved man who had friends in every walk of life. Although his life was cut short prematurely, he was on the home grounds he loved when he left us.


Always a Champion, Bill was playing his usual top-flight tennis game for his Sunnyvale Tennis Club's Annual Turnament when he was fatally stricken. Las Palmas Tennis Center will never seem the same for me when I can't be greeted by Bill's ever-smiling face as he whizzes in to sign up for a court.


As an educator, Bill Toy was a champion for his children as well as his teaching staff. He worked hard to provide rich experiences for the children in his schools, for he knew many had limited family lives, command of English language, and social opportunities. Although his days were busy as a respected elementary school principal he accepted willingly to be my fellow Board member of the Sunnyvale Community Services' Asian Services Committee. He was ever a concerned man -- concerned about today's children today's problems, and tomorrow's world.


We are saddened he won't be here to enjoy that world with us, but we will never forget the champ of a man we knew in our beloved friend, Bill Toy.


On a happier note, although equally as heart-rending for me, was the glorious celebration given to their parents by Loren, Denis and Marvin Lee to commemorate their 30th wedding anniversary. Pearl and Frank Lee were a mighty surprised twosome when over 100 of their friends greeted them at the Fung Lum Restaurant in Campbell.


This occasion was made more meaningful to all because Frank had recently survived a tragic fall from a stepladder at his Pruneyard Swenson's Restaurant, breaking his back severely. Walking with the aid of steel back brace, which he laughingly said keeps him from eating as much as he'd like, he was greeted heartily by his friends, who all agreed Frank is one guy you'd have to search hard and long for to find a harsh word to say about him.


There weren't too many dry eyes in the crowd when each of his children spoke of their love and appreciation for their parents, who, to quote Marvin ""always let us have our dreams, even though they sacrificed theirs so we could have the opportunity to live ours, Denise followed, saying, ""I always wanted to grow up to be a wife and mother like my mom, but just in these past months trying to help out my parents in these hard times, I know I could never fill those shoes she has so capably and unselfishly tred for our sake.


Loren, home to be with his parents while working on his doctoral dissertation this summer from Harvard, thanked his dad lovingly for giving them the opportunity to continue their education in whatever field they chose. He said, ""My father had to work hard and long since he was a young boy to get his own education, perhaps not being able to choose the field he himself wanted, but he has never denied us our needs and desires.""


The Frank Lees are the epitome of a happy family who love each other and are proud to tell each other how much they care. For those of us who were able to share this shining moment of happiness with them, we will not soon forget seeing the glory that comes from a loving family relationship. Happy Anniversary, Pearl and Frank. I love you too!

LOS ANGELES -- Xie Peiji, Vice President of Tsinghua University in Beijing, arrived in the United States with a group of five faculty members to observe the administrative operational methods as practiced in American universities.


U.C. Berkeley was their first stop. The complexity of running a university was much in evidence when they met with many department heads, including the Berkeley, academic senate, public affairs office, graduate division, advisor to foreign students and scholars office, campus planning office, facilities management, etc.


Also arranged were meetings to visit the engineering, chemistry, and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. After a brief stop at Stanford and Los Angeles, they headed east to visit Austin, Texas, Cornell University, MIT, and New York Technical College.


During their one-and-a-half-day in the Los Angeles area, the delegation was hosted to a luncheon at Fu Ling Restaurant by Charles Wong (alumnus of Tsinghua U.) and other alumni of TU, a reunion, so to speak, and visited Disneyland. It is estimated there are over 200 TU alumni in the L.A. area.


Since the Jem Lews (whose daughter, Laurie, has been teaching English at TU for the past year and has extended her contract for another year) live close to Disneyland, they hosted a dinner and visit with the delegation at a local Chinese Restaurant.


On July 9 there will be a group of 22 young people, mainly children of TU alumni, going to Beijing for six weeks -- three weeks of studying the Chinese language and culture and three weeks of travel within China under the leadership of Daisy and Jack Quan of Berkeley. There will be four from Southern California, including Scott Lew, Laurie's younger brother.


Tsinghua University has the reputation as being the ""MIT of China.""

H.K. Wong and I have known each other for more than a half century, and have worked together on community projects for nearly that long. I will not dwell on his accomplishments for they are many and are best told elsewhere in this paper.


I can recall that as a young man, he was reluctant to do any writing, stating simply that he ""didn't think I could."" But with a good bit of urging he became a popular columnist in local community papers and in Vancouver. Later, the generous soul gave me credit for encouraging him to write. I sincerely believe that he is the one outstanding public relations person who has contributed so much over so long a period in our community's relations with the City of San Francisco.


As a father, he was genuinely proud of his PTA membership card when his son, Wesley, was in elementary school.


As an example of his intense interest in youth and sports, he was one of the principal founders of the Chinese Tennis Club, founded in 1935. That same year he initiated interest in the formation of the Chinese National Tennis Championships. Over the decades, he was also the one who solicited most of the trophies in support of these games.


Noting the traffic congestion in Chinatown, he was one of the first to urge a coalition of local leaders to back a plan to build Portsmouth Square Garage, which has become a lifesaver in alleviating local traffic.


In the early 1960s, H.K. was the first one I invited to join me in founding the Chinese Historical Society of America, which was launched on January 5, 1963. For the past 21 years, he has labored wholeheartedly on Society activities. He was well into the work of publishing his oral history project taped over the past few years when his health began to fail.


I believe it was his interest in people that brought him the greatest satisfaction. He was always willing to help the deserving. He has helped countless young people in shaping their careers--and even acted as cupid to many couples up and down the state.


For years we socialized together and exchanged confidences and advice to each other some of which were heeded--others, not, as good friends can do and still be friends.


I will miss him deeply, and for what he has accomplished for Chinatown and his City. I feel that both are the better for his having been with us, and sharing his talents with us.

LOS ANGELES -- One of the challenges facing the next generation of Asian Americans will be to retain their ethnic and cultural traditions while assimilating into the American mainstream, said a speaker here.


Dr. Samuel Lin, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services and an expert on nutrition, made the comment at a dinner given in his honor at the Cathay Manor senior citizens housing project at the gateway to Chinatown.


Community leaders active in the founding of the Cathay Manor saluted Lin for his efforts in securing funding for the project, and for his advice on establishing the seniors' nutrition program.


Lin's background has been wide and varied. He has been on many commissions and agencies,; has served as staff physician and the clinical director of India Health Service Clinic on the Colville Reservation in Washington State; was named the director of the Office of Europe in the Office of international Health; was executive secretary for both the U.S. Soviet and the U.S.-Polish Joint committees for Health Cooperation; and other intergovernmental science and technology boards.


As Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, Lin is the principal advisor on the leadership and direction of the Public Health Service regional offices. As a regular officer of the PHS Commissioned Corps, Dr. Lin holds the rank of Assistant Surgeon General (Commodore, USN). He has been the recipient of the PHS Achievement Medal, the PHS Citation (twice), the PHS Commendation Medal and PHS Meritorious Service Medal.


""It is a time for us, as Asian Americans, to recommit ourselves to making a greater contribution, individually and collectively, to this country that we have adopted as our own,"" Lin said.


""America has often been likened to a melting pot of many peoples. Well, I think that is a erroneous impression of what makes up America. A well-respected Asian American educator, physicist Chia-Wei Woo, president of San Francisco State University, likens America to a good stew in which there are different meats, vegetables and spices. Each ingredient is distinct and unique, and yet the stew as a whole is tasty and healthful solely because of the unique contributions of flavor and nutrition from each ingredient.


""The total character of the stew is a result of the separate and individual character of each ingredient. And those different characters can be likened to the different kinds of heritage we all have brought to this country,"" Lin said.


""Well, what is the challenge of our distinct heritage? I believe the challenge is to be able to maintain the essence or substance of our unique heritage while assimilating more into the Western culture in which we live and work.""


""The challenge of our heritage is for us to maintain those ancient virtues which have helped Asian Americans succeed in given fields, while living in an adopted country and culture the challenge to our heritage is for us to move ourselves into new areas of responsibility and recognition requiring us to become more acclimated to this culture and to this society. Of course, there is the danger that as we become more acclimated that we may, as individuals and as a group, lose some of the old world traditions. However, I believe as long as we retain the virtues of our heritage, we will not only apply them successfully in these new areas, but by their retention, hold firmly to the important linkage of our ancient culture,"" Lin said.

LOS ANGELES -- Tamlyn Tomita, this year's International Nisei Week Queen is doing fine on the set of ""The Karate Kid, Part 2,"" which is now filming on locating in Hawaii.


According to her uncle, Setz Tomita, ""We've received one postcard from her and it says the usual things. She's doing fine.""


Tomita won the Miss Nisei Week Beauty Pageant in Los Angeles in 1984 and went to Brazil for the international pagaent earlier this year. She was asked to audition for a part in the movie shortly after her return from Brazil. It has been reported that she will have speaking lines -- and more then just a few.


""The Karate Kid, Part 2"" is a sequel to the movie by the same name. The story revolves around a Caucasian boy who had developed an interest in the martial arts (in the first movie) as taught by an old Japanese karate master, played by Pat Morita. Morita has played many movie and television roles including Arnold the restaurant owner in the popular ""Happy Days"" television series.


In the second movie the master returns to his home town in Okinawa with his young student to fight real estate developers who threaten the traditional ways of the town.


Shortly after their arrival the boy falls in love with the daughter of the town leader, played by Tamlyn Tomita. This will be Tomita's first experience in acting.


According to sources who have read the script, the movie will be a sensitive and accurate portrayal of cultural and ethnic values. It has been reported that the production company has worked closely with various members of the Asian American community to make sure the script will not be biased in any way.

LOS ANGELES -- The star of the film, ""Year of the Dragon,"" called his critics ""totally gutless"" and accused L.A. City Councilman Mike Woo of ""grandstanding"" in his efforts to protect the Asian American community from racial stereotypes.


""Year of the Dragon"" sparked outrage from coast to coast when it opened last month, Asian Americans charged that the film reinforced ""the worst stereotypes"" of Asians, portraying them as members of the ""Chinese Mafia"" involved in murder and drug smuggling.


The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in Los Angeles filed a $100 million suit against makers of the film, charging that all members of the CCBA worldwide were libeled in the film. (See Asian Week, 8/30/85.)


Actor Mickey Rourke, who portrayed the racist New York policeman who declares war on Chinatown in the film, told L.A. Times reporter Deborah Caulfield that the criticism is unwarranted.


""It's been a nightmare. It's completely changed the way I feel toward film critics and the media,"" Rourke said.


Woo recently negotiated with the top management of MGM/UA, the studio distributing the film, to add a disclaimer to the movie warning audiences that its depiction of Asians did not represent the Asian American community.


Rourke said Woo's interest was only selfish.


""He's only become involved in that issue to elevate himself politically. Let Woo organize something to feed people who can't get jobs instead of grandstanding like this,"" Rourke said.


Rourke's successful career has raised him to ""Godfather-like status"" among younger actors, Caulfield noted.


However, the 30-year-old actor reacted bitterly to being on the receiving end of negative rather than adoring publicity.


""Sometimes I used to read what they had to say about movies, but after what we've been through with the critics on this film, my opinion of them has changed. They're totally gutless people who don't realize that it takes one or two years to make a movie. To slash things apart like that..."" Rourke said, stopping mid-sentence.


Rourke also complained that an interview he taped with ""Good Morning America"" co-host Joan Lunden was never aired because he was too supportive of director Michael Cimeno.

KUALA LAMPUR -- Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia warned his country's press that it will be subject to increased censorship if it continues to ""highlight sensitive racial and political issues and undermine national unity,"" UPI reported.


Mahathir, who has been in office since 1981, added that if the press does not change its practices, the government ""will have to rethink its liberal policy.""


The National Union of Journalists responded by asking, ""What liberal policy? The liberal attitude professed by the government can only be judged by its deeds and not words alone.""


Manathir argues that his administration has done more for the press than any of his predecessors, and that his government has issued more printing permits than any other administration. Yet, the reins on the government aligned press have been drawn in by a barrage of legislation ranging from a fightening of the Offical Secrets Act to increasing control over foreign publications, the service reported.


The prime minister is expected to call a general election before April 1986, and it is believed that part of his concern about the press stems from his desire to make this election an issue-free campaign.


In addition, he is also concerned about the growing polarization among the country's seven million ethnic Malays, five million Chinese and three million Indians. In 1969 the country experienced a wave of violent rioting as a result of racial tensions.


""If our newspapers fan the embers of racialism in any issue,"" he said, ""they may well fan it into a conflagration that even the whole might of the government may not be able to put it out.""


Also, Mahathir has been unhappy with the press coverage of his speeches and believes that there has been undue and unnecessary criticism of his policies. He attacked newspapers that carried Malaysian stories originally published in overseas newspapers, of making his government look bad.


Compared to the press in Western countries, the Malaysian press is relatively weak and easily controlled. Most newspapers are owned by branches of the ruling political parties. As one official explained, ""there is no press freedom per se.""


There are more than 40 domestic newspapers and publications in Malaysia, and each one must obtain a license to print. This license can be revoked by the government at any time.


Mahathir said that journalists should understand that there are certain local traditions and values which must be respected to preserve national security.


The Journalists Union argues that many of the country's political problems could be solved if the control over newspapers was lessened. They believe there are already too many laws and regulations restraining the press in Malaysia.

SAN FRANCISCO -- When brand new Cable Car # 19 rolls out of the Woods Carpentry Shop early next year and joins the rebuilt cars of The City's National Landmark system, it will be thanks to the efforts of Harry Jew, journeyman carpenter, who worked on this construction project in addition to his regular duties over the past several years.


Jew's co-workers and supervisors honored him with coffee and cakes in the Cable Car Barn at Washington and Mason. Streets recently, naming him Maintenance Workers of the Month for May 1985.


The title brought $125 in cash awards to Jew, in addition to commendation letters for his personnel file; the Public Utilities Commission Honor Award and the uniquely designed Maintenance Worker of the Month brass belt buckle.


In addition to the cash awards of $25 from the Municipal Railway Shopmen's Credit Union and $100 from T.D.I. Winston, Muni's advertising contractor, Jew is ""in the running"" to win a trip to Hawaii for two, courtesy of T.D.I. Winston.


Jew was born in Canton, China, in 1948. In 1952 the Jew family moved to Hong Kong, where he learned carpentry and cabinet making, and in 1966 they arrived in San Francisco. He served a six-year stint with the U.S. Army, which included a tour in Germany, where he was trained in heavy truck maintenance. Following his active and reserve military service, Jew worked at a variety of jobs including taxi driver, waiter and gas station attendent.


In 1980, he married Elaine Tai, who had emigrated to Indiana from Hong Kong. They have a son Bryant, age two. Mrs. Jew is in hotel work with the Sheraton at Fishermen's Wharf.


Jew came to work for Muni in January 1982, responding to a temporary call for a skilled carpenter. He successfully completed Civil Service examinations for a permanent position in 1984 and expects to be called to it early next year.


In his spare time Jew might be found fashioning furniture in his garage workshop. An accomplished gunsmith, Jew also loads his own ammunition for deer and elk hunting.


In congratulating Jew, Municipal Railway Acting General Manager Ann Branston praised his skills, attitude, professionalism and ability to work well with minimum supervision, ""all qualities which make Mr. Jew a fully worthy recipient of the coveted Maintenance Worker of the Month award.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- April 20, 1985 is a date that will long be remembered by the Fan family. It was on that day that the Tao Tsing Fan and his wife, To Hai Duong, were reunited with their two sons after 10 years of separation.


When Tao Fan was fleeing Vietnam with his wife and sons, Long, then four, and Thang, three, they were told by officials at the airport that the young boys would have to remain behind.


""We were at the airport already,"" Fan recalled in a San Francisco Examiner interview. ""I don't know what happened. The Vietnamese government suddenly canceled the visa. They say the children were born in Vietnam and have to stay in Vietnam. But who knows? I don't know.""


So while the parents left to make a new home in the U.S. and prepare for their sons' arrival, which they believed would follow shortly, the children were looked after by their grandparents in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.


The Fans' short wait for their sons turned into 10 years of letters and telephone calls to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Red Cross, Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), and Sen. Alan Cranston.


Bill O'Callahan, assistant director of emergency services for the Golden Gate chapter of the Red Cross, noted that three social workers were assigned to the Fan case.


""It was so arduous,"" he said. ""One piece of correspondence can take months and then end up unopened in someone's drawer. As it happened, it took years.""


At one point, Fan reached the Vietnamese delegate to the United Nations.


""I called him many times,"" he said. ""I tell him we have two children there. I tell him many times. They say they will send our papers to Hanoi. Only Hanoi can make the decision. They say we have to wait until Hanoi make the decision. The children are in Ho Chi Minh City. I don't know why they do this.""


When Hanoi finally made the decision, Long, Thang and their grandmother were simply granted an exit visa and put on a flight to the U.S. The grandfather is still in Vietnam.


It was a joyful but tense reunion, Fan recalled. ""We don't know each other. They were babies at that time (when he and his wife last saw them). But they like it here. In Vietnam they don't have enough to eat. It's very poor there.""


The Fans currently live in Balboa Park and the boys attend James Denman Middle School. They speak very little English.


Tao Fan's main concern now is money. A mechanical engineer who once worked for the U.S. Navy in Vietnam, he has been unemployed for the past two months.

TOKUNOSHIMA, Japan -- Shigechiyo Izumi claims that a daily dosage of shochu liquor has help given him longevity. Izumi recently celebrated his 120th birthday, making him the world's oldest living man, MND reports.


The town where he lives gave him a party at the town hall because 120 is what the Japanese call ""dai kanreki"" or ""double 60.""


In the old days, before the war, the average person's life expectancy was 50. Thus, when a person reached 60, he had a special birthday wearing a red hat and jacket: an event the Japanese called ""kanreki.""


Izumi has been listed as the world's oldest living man in the Guiness Book of World Records since 1979.


Izumi walks the garden of his home without the aid of a stick, relatives say. And he never forgets to drink ""shochu"" at dinner.


Izumi credits his longevity to ""God's will."" He is looking forward to loving into a new eight mat room being added to his hourse.

You've been out of school for several years now, and, after a variety of entry level positions, you've landed a position offering you the challenge and career potential you've been seeking. The salary is enough to provide a comfortable living, and your future earnings are promising. But, somewhere in the back of your mind, a nagging thought exists about your single status and what the years ahead hold for you.


Singles sometimes fall into the trap of assuming their single state is merely a temporary condition. Some believe they only need money to live comfortably until they find a spouse to share expenses. Others believe they must spend everything now, before family responsibilities take their toll on energy and income. But neither attitude is farsighted.


The current divorce rate in the United States is approximately 50 percent. If you choose to marry, you stand a 50-50 chance of staying married. Of course, you may enjoy your present lifestyle and choose to remain single. Either way, place yourself at the top of your priority list and establish a plan for your financial future.


Meet with a financial planner to get a fix on your needs and goals, and develop a financial program to meet those goals -- from the present right through retirement.


It's never too early to plan for retirement. Planning ahead can assure you of independence in retirement. Current Social Security Administration figures show that for every 100 Americans who reach the traditional retirement age of 65, 75 are financially dependent on family, friends, church or other charity; 23 continue to work, many out of necessity; and only two are financially independent. Ask yourself some tough questions:


First, does your employer provide retirement benefits? It's a good place to begin, but certainly not sufficient in itself. You may want to look into the benefits of an Individual Retirement Account, annuities, or a Keogh plan if you're self-employed. Small amounts diverted from your paycheck and wisely invested will provide a secure retirement living. Depending on your present and future needs and income, your planner may suggest a variety of options for retirement planning.


Then, as unpleasant as it may sound, do you have a will? The lack of a will can cause all kinds of hassles and heartaches for your heirs. The will or estate plan is simply a means to protect what you have worked so diligently to build.


Although retirement plays a large role in your overall financial plan, it is not the only consideration. You may choose to accumulate money for long-term goals such as building real estate equity through the purchase of a home, financing a master's degree or enjoying elaborate vacations each year.


There are also immediate needs to consider. Everyone should have a cushion to fall back on in case of emergency or in the event a particularly attractive opportunity presents itself. A balanced financial plan will provide a means for the liquidity necessary to meet these pressing needs.


Be sure to review your insurance protection. Insurance is a fundamental factor in your financial plan. Singles, providing their own solitary source of income, should carefully consider insurance coverage and try to avoid the expense of being over-insured or under-insured.


Your life and health should be covered, of course, but don't overlook disability insurance in case you become femporarily unemployed or disabled. Remember, you may need to make car, rent or mortgage payments while you're out of work.


Your time for financial planning is now. A financial planner can help you determine your needs and goals, develop a budget, establish a regular savings plan, and keep you up to date on new trends in investment products and services.


A balanced financial plan will consider your financial objectives and work toward growth and security in both the long and short run. Whatever your marital status may be a lifetime financial plan is essential.

OAKLAND -- John Loh, a Shanghai-born Oakland resident and businessman, has been named ""Immigrant of the Year"" from China by the International Institute of the East Bay, a United Way agency.


The award recognizes Loh's accomplishments and community service activities. Loh has worked with such organizations as the Asian Business League, the Big Brothers of San Francisco, the Oakland Chinatown PAC, the Coalition for Chinatown Development, Wah Sung Service Club and the newly organized Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. In addition, Loh uses his company's office in Walnut Creek for meetings of the Chinese American Political Association of Contra Costa.


Loh, an American citizen, attributes his significant contribution of time and effort to a desire to ""help the Chinese become more involved in the mainstream of American politics. As a people, we have shown talent in every field but politics. We have no voice in the Senate or Assembly, and both America and the Chinese Americans are the poorer for it.""


""I would like to be a part of the spearhead movement to encourage the American Chinese to achieve integration by contributing not only as individuals, but as people, to a better government,"" he continued.


Lon uses the term ""American Chinese"" instead of the more common ""Chinese American"" phrase because, although he is proud of his ancestry and his country of birth, America is the country in which he has chosen to live.


He has worked in the real estate industry since 1979; the last three years in the investment division of McMasters & Westland's commercial real estate office in Walnut Creek and Oakland. As an investment consultant he works with Asian investors to provide access to the opportunities of Contra Costa's growing Highway 680 corridor, Oakland, San Francisco and the Peninsula. ""I can provide the foreign investor, unfamiliar with our distinct market conditions, with a wealth of information about areas beyond my field of expertise by working in tandem with other professionals in my company,"" he said.


Loh admits to being both proud and a bit embarrassed by the attention that he has received in being selected for the prestigious award.


""I am proud of the International Institute's achievements in counseling, educating and supporting the abilities of immigrants arriving in this country,"" he said. ""I consider them a valuable resource to American Chinese and to the community at large.""


Loh resides in the Oakland hills with his wife of eight years and two ""thoroughly American"" daughters.

SAN JOSE -- There is about $3.1 billion out there just waiting for Asian American business operators.


The State of California is required to reserve 10 percent of its $31 billion procurement budget for transactions with small businesses or firms owned by women and minority members. The Office of Small and Minority Business was established to help such firms compete for their share of the huge state pie.


Stim Suzuki, president of the OSMB, and Clayton Fong of Gov. George Deukmejian's office, recently spoke to the Asian Business League of Santa Clara Valley of the opportunities available in doing business with the state.


Suzuki pointed out that, in order to qualify as women or minority owned, a firm must be at least 51 percent owned by one or more minorities or women. Management of day-to-day business operations must also be controlled by one or more such individuals.


Those considered in the minority groups are blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Alaskan natives and Filipinos.


""The State of California,"" Suzuki noted, ""buys on the lowest bid basis for commodities and construction contracts, but not for services. To help small and minority businesses in their bidding, the Small Business Preference Act allows 5 percent of a low bid to go toward the reduction of a high bid made by a verified small business.""


For example, a small business bidding $19,789 would win a contract over another bidding only $18,975, because of the 5 percent preference clause.


In his discussion of the procurement of commodities, Suzuki indicated that ""the state buys about $400 million annually. Unlike the federal government, the state does not buy off-the-shelf items, buys very little in custom orders, and it does not buy for resale but for consumption only.


""The state,"" he continued, ""buys mostly from distributors and manufacturers, and if a retailer becomes a participant, he is confronted with a great deal of competition.


""Furthermore, the state buys approximately 50,000 different kinds of items like stationery, pharmaceutical products, industrial supplies, farm goods, food, furniture, electronic equipment and many other items,"" Suzuki noted.


In the future though, informed Suzuki, ""the state is going to be buying very specialized items like products in telecommunication, and those dealing in these products would have to have a high degree of technical skills and know how.""


To qualify as a small business under procurement, California residency and business location are required and the business must be independently owned and operated, and it must not be considered dominant in its field of operation.


Also any entity which has an affiliate which is not considered a small business will be disqualified as a small business.


As for non-manufacturers, one shall qualify as a small business if its receipts in the aggregate for the preceding three years do not exceed the maximum receipts specified by the OSMB for the applicable industry group.


As for construction, Suzuki urges minorities to take a strong interest in this area. ""About $500 million to $1 billion is spent annually in construction, but the spending goes in cycles, in the next five years, for instance, California is expected to spend $13 billion because of its extensive building program. Ten percent of that amount is expected to go toward minority subcontractors and 16 percent toward women bidding for contracts,"" he said.


""Much of the escalation in spending is due in part to plans by the California Department of Correction to build more prison facilities,"" noted Suzuki, ""and this will offer many contract opportunities for minorities.""


The primary source of construction contracts is through the Office of State Architects. An OSA office for the Bay Area is located at 1111 Jackson St. Rm. 4024, Oakland, CA 94607.


All construction projects in the state are required to advertise projects over $500 in the California State Contracts Register. Those projects amounting to $25,000 or more may be listed in trade papers of general circulation in both Los Angeles and San Francisco.


The state also spends about $1 billion a year on a wide range of services which must be performed by the private sector under some form of service contract. Types of service include pest and weed control, consulting, data processing, photograph, rental, trade, etc.


""Those interested in service contracts should subscribe to the California State Contracts Register,"" said Suzuki, ""or contact state and local government agencies. Also, watch for announcement of opportunities in newspapers, business and professional organizations, and in minority business enterprise funded organizations.


""However,"" said Suzuki, ""there is a stumbling block for Asians who are interested in obtaining service contracts. There is an oral presentation before an evaluation panel which requires communication skills. Generally, Asians don't do well in this phase."" Suzuki feels that Asians need to develop their communication skills to further their business interests.


""The state spends a great deal in commodities, construction and service contracts, but it buys in consistency. It usually buys the same things from year to year. Unlike private businesses, there is a lot of information issued on how to do business with the state like bonding, delivery, pitfalls etc.,"" Suzuki said.


The chief of the OSMB also advised those doing business with the state not to rely on their activity with the state as their sole source of income. Although there is money to be made there, contracts have to be renewed and there is no guarantee that the bid is awarded to the same person.


Also, there are certain negatives in doing business with the state. Suzuki indicated several: (1) Those trying to sell to the state are dealing with professional buyers who know what they are doing. (2) There are certain risks involved like having the total responsibility of the product performance rest with the subcontractors. (3) Although there is a great deal of information disseminated by the state, there is a limit to their assistance.


Suzuki has taken a personal interest in helping Asians, but he feels they need to play a more forceful role in society and in government.


""In the past,"" he remarked, ""Asians were reluctant to assume leadership roles, but now that Asians are entering into the mainstream, they should participate more in non-Asian organizations, they should not support inequities, and they should build channels of communication and communication infrastructures.""


Suzuki is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and has 26 years in state service of which 17 years have been as a buyer with the State Office of Procurement. He has been actively involved in small and minority business programs since 1973 and served as the Small Business Liaison for the Office of Procurement. He works closely with the Legislature to promote support of small business.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A refugee from Vietnam and a woman reentry student have both been awarded $1,000 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants scholarships for minority students.


Quang Mau escaped by boat from Vietnam when he was 17 years old. After a year in an Indonesian refugee camp, he and his older brother and two sisters settled in San Francisco. Mau graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School, attended City College of San Francisco from 1981 to 1985 and, after receiving his AS in Accounting, transferred to S.F. State University in September.


""I hope to establish myself as a CPA and bring my parents to the United States,"" said Mau, who is working his way through school as an accounting assistant in the Trust Funds Accounting Department at S.F. State.


Julie Lee graduated from high school in 1974 and attended CCSF part-time before dropping out to work in a variety of clerical positions.


""After six years, I realized I wasn't getting anywhere so I returned to City College,"" Lee said. She went from earning ""C's"" and ""D's"" in high school to a nearly straight ""A"" average, which not only won her the AICPA scholarship but also a full-tuition scholarship to Golden Gate University. She credits the change in her academic performance to motivation: ""School is not hard, but in high school my attitude was entirely different. I'm glad I had a chance to start over.""


Both Mau and Lee were nominated for the AICPA scholarships by Ron Rubin, Advisor for City College's Accounting Department. He encourages people of all ages and backgrounds to look into the course offerings at CCSF. ""People like Quang and Julie who either want to start a career or want a second chance will find many opportunities at City College.""

Nearly 300 students gathered at Stanford University this past weekend to attend the annual west coast Asian/Pacific Student Union Conference.


The day-long conference was highlighted by guest speakers, group workshops and a cultural night for students to socialize with one another. Representatives from the East Coast Asian Student Union, Black Student Union, statewide MECHA, and Students against Reaganism were all in attendance. Many people drove from as far away as Oregon and San Diego to attend.


Jenny Tsai, speaker for the Asian/Pacific Student Union, introduced the theme of the conference, ""The status of Asian/Pacific People: Defining Who We Are in '85,"" by explaining that ""there is a confusion as to the status of Asian Americans. The model minority myth divides Asian/Pacific people.""


The problem, as Tsai put it, is that those Asian Americans who have the resources to help their community fail to do so because they do not see a problem existing in the first place.


Tsai pointed out that some Asians have indeed become successful in achieving high economic, social and political status, and therefore do serve as examples supporting the model minority thesis. These Asians however, like society in general, come to believe that their success stories are typical of the Asian American experience. They fail to recognize that the majority of Asians are still victims of discrimination and are politically underrepresented, she said.


Dr. Alan Seid, a psychologist and representative from Asian Pacific American Advocates of California, spoke on the grimmer side of reality. He cited headlines of violence in the form of beatings, tapes, and murders of Asian Pacific Americans.


""Anti-Asian incidents are sweeping the country. There has been a significant rise not only in racist attacks, but also stereotypes of Asians in written and electornic media, and institutional discrimination."" Dr. Seid recommended that Asian Pacific Americans take action to unify and identify themselves across race and age.


Mabel Teng, who is affiliated with the Asian Pacific Democratic Caucus, Chinese Progressive Association, and is the Northern California chair of the Rainbow Coalition, was the last keynote speaker. She emphasized that ""our action shows our concern, our inaction implies consent.""


""The model minority myth conditions us to believe that we will all eventually achieve equality if we work hard, keep calm. That isn't true. Most Asians have no choice and are stuck in lower echelon jobs with few unions. They are the working class and the poor,"" Teng said.


""Those who have 'made it' do not represent the Asian Pacific American population. America was built on the exploitation of minorities,"" Teng charged.


Later in the day, a lighter side of the conference was brought on by a jazz band led by Jon Jang who offered a hand-clapping and thought-provoking rendition of his song, ""Are You Chinese or Charlie Chan?""


Sandy Chin from San Francisco State University tickled some funny bones with her comedy routine which, while poking fun at aspects of the Asian culture, avoided being racist. Many in the audience could relate to her joke that ""we are all slaves to the rice cooker.""


The Pilipino American Alliance of UC Berkeley performed songs in Tagalog, and the evening culminated with a dance dee-jayed by Vision Sounds.


It was well after midnight when people started on their way home. Though it had been a long day, people were already talking about coming back next year to share common interests and goals and to concentrate on contemporary issues facing the Asian Pacific community.

TAIPEI -- Restaurants here have been feeding their customers pig swill, it was discovered last month.


Outrage mounted against several manufacturers of cooking oil after they admitted to selling oil processed from the offal intended for swine, China Post reported.


Food stalls, seafood restaurants, other food vendors and private residents have purchased the oil and used it in cooking in several urban areas of Taiwan.


The Bureau of Investigation has arrested 17 people for manufacturing the oil after six months of investigation. Arrests included that Lin Teh-ching of Teh Tai Cooking Oil Co., which sold 500,000 gallons of the recycled oil in the past 10 years for millions of dollars.


The manufacturers apparently gleaned oil from restaurant table scraps and found they could turn a high profit by selling it for cooking purpose instead of following the normal procedure of making it into soap.


Manufacturers would often add sulfuric acid to separate out solids, and bleach to lighten the color and eliminate the odor of the offal oil, said Lin Kunjung, a suspect in the oil scam.


Doctors reported that the use of recycled oil could cause liver hardening, swelling or cancer, One vendor who used the oil said his whole family has suffered from skin disease and his brother is almost bald as a result of the tainted product.


Even legitimate cooking oil manufacturers have suffered a decline in sales, and oil made by the state owned Taiwan Sugar Corp; is sold out because of the scandal.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Police Commissioner Thomas Hsieh hopes to raise half a million dollars for a campaign for the S.F. Board of Supervisors next year.


Speaking at a press conference in Chinatown last week, Hsieh said he would need a huge campaign war chest to have any hope of unseating an incumbent in next year's election.


""When an incumbent spends $1, a non-incumbent needs to spend $3,"" Hsieh said. ""The non-incumbent has to raise an extremely high amount of money.""


Hsieh has not officially declared his candidacy for supervisor but is working nearly full-time to explore his chances of winning one of the five seats up for election in 1986. He is expected to announce his decision on whether to run by February or March.


A large part of his decision will depend on how much money he can accumulate for his campaign.


""An incumbent can get reelected with a campaign chest of about $200,000. But a non-incumbent had better double that -- $500,000 or $600,000 would be even better."" Hsieh said.


""Preferably I would like to have $500,000. If I do decide to run, the minimum I will need is $350,000 to $400,000,"" Hsieh added.


Hsieh had called the press conference at the headquarters of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance to publicize two fundraisers scheduled for this month.


The CACA will hold a $25 buffet-and dance for Hsieh at its headquarters on Saturday, Nov. 16. The low-cost event is designed to establish Hsieh's grassroots support. A cocktail reception at the St. Francis Hotel will be held on Monday, Nov. 18, priced at $250 per person. For information about either event call 989-4646.


At a recent dinner for Hsieh, which raised more than $50,000, Board of Supervisors President John Molinari endorsed Hsieh's unannounced candidacy and promised to work with Hsieh's campaign if he decided to run.


Hsieh said last week that he expects Molinari to give ""active support"" in his campaign.


Harold Fong, former national president of the CACA, spoke warmly of Hsieh's record of community involvement during the past two decades.


Issues that Hsieh promised to focus on included the need for a new park in Chinatown as well as a master plan for future development, and halting the trend toward anti-Asian sentiments leading to violence.

SINGAPORE -- Authorities here are worried that the easy availability of abortions is encouraging more and more young women, especially teenagers, to choose this way of getting rid of unwanted babies.


Reuters reported the government's findings that the number of women seeking abortions has risen three times since 1974, when abortion was legalized as part of the republic's family planning program.


An average of 50 women turned up at government clinics and other authorized abortion centers every day in 1984, records showed. Teenagers made up one-tenth of 19,000 abortions officially recorded last year.


Statistics also found that 460 teenagers went for abortions more than once last year, as compared with only five in 1974.


In a survey conducted by the . . . one in five women said that they had sexual relations with their boyfriends, and more than half said neither they nor their partners used contraceptives.


Seow Peck Leng, president of the Singapore Women's Association, said that the most ""horrifying aspect"" of the increase is that ""many girls have had repeated abortions without remorse.""


She attributed the trend to a freer lifestyle and the easy and cheap abortions available in the country.


Abortions at government hospitals cost only $2.30, and unmarried teenagers can have the operation performed without the consent or knowledge of her parents.


Private clinics charge between $90 and $227 to conduct the abortion.


While religious and civic leaders have voiced opposition to abortion, the government and pro-abortion advocates maintain that doing away with the Abortion Act will be more harmful than it will be beneficial.


""Making the law more restrictive is not going to wipe out the problem of teenage pregnancies but may instead force pregnant teenagers to seek backstreet abortions,"" said Aline Wong, a sociologist and a member of Parliament.


Instead, she suggested that there should be more classes on moral and sexual education in the schools.


However, the Reverend Robert Bathetchet, a Catholic priest and director of the schools moral education program, disagreed and said that abortion should be illegal.


""If it's wrong, it's wrong. It's like legalizing little bits of murder,"" he said.


A member of Parliament, Augustine Tan, agree. ""People should wake up to the fact that this is an abomination of the grossest kind that we can perpetrate on ourselves, our women and our future generation,"" he said.


Some physicians have also expressed concern over the fact that under present law, abortions can be performed even up to the sixth month of pregnancy.


Women undergoing abortions at this time risk the danger of bleeding, infection and might even die, noted Dr. Charles Ng, a prominent obstetrician and gynecologist.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A non-profit civil rights group here has entered the fray in a five-month-old labor battle involving a large number of Chinese American restaurant workers.


Chinese for Affirmative Action announced Monday it was withdrawing its account from the Bank of Trade, in support of striking workers of the San Francisco Commercial Club. Harold R. Arthur, president of the Chinatown-based Bank of Trade, is also a member of the Commercial Club's board of directors and served as its president last year.


Noting that the majority of he club's employees are Chinese Americans and that the bank conducts much of its business in the Chinese community, CAA executive director Henry Der complained in a letter to Arthur that ""while you have gainful employment at the Bank of Trade, these Chinese American workers of the club are out in the cold.""


A CAA press release noted that many Chinese American workers after World, War II ""accepted employment at the S.F. Commercial Club in positions that white workers refused. These Chinese American workers have literally raised their families and sent their children to college by providing loyal, faithful service at the S.F. Commercial Club.""


The decision to boycott the bank was made by the CAA Board of Trustees at its Feb. 13 meeting. The CAA has maintained an account with Bank of Trade since 1969 but ""cannot in good conscience continue banking with a Chinatown financial institution whose top executive officer has been party to turning the clock back on wages and benefits to Chinese American workers;"" Der said.


CAA noted that the workers are willing to accept a pay freeze with no cuts in fringe benefits.

One was about a government worker who was injured while trying to confiscate thousands of copies of a magazine, the Progress Weekly. Chou Fu-sheng of the Journalism Dept of the Taipei County Government said he was trying to ban the magazine because it promotes communism, distorts facts and confuses people's opinion.""


The other story concerned a statement by Chang King-yuh, director general of the Government information Office, that certain magazine publishers had gone beyond the range of freedom of the press guaranteed by the constitution Among the rules not to be broken is ""endangering social order,"" reported the paper.

SINGAPORE -- Filipino workers here are sending home about S$2.4 million per month, the Straits Times reported.


About 12,000 Filipinos maids and construction workers are currently employed in Singapore, 80 percent of whom are maids, according to estimates from the Philippine National Bank. But a Philippine Embassy official estimated there could be as many as 16,000 such workers in Singapore.


The Philippine government requires that all such workers send home half of their salaries. If they refuse to comply, they may never be allowed to work overseas again.


The paper reported that a number of Filipino workers, rather than telegraph the money home through normal channels, have sent the money with friends who are traveling to the islands. That way, according to theory, the friends can have the currency converted to pesos for a better exchange rate on the black market.

Metro Goldwyn Mayer/United Artists (MGM/UA), the distributors of the film, ""Year Of The Dragon,"" last month issued a formal apology and disclaimer after nationwide protests against the movie's depiction of Chinese Americans.


""Year Of The Dragon"" has been the target of protests by Asian Americans in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Boston and Seattle. Protesters claim the film is racist and sexist, and presents a distorted view of New York's Chinatown and Chinese Americans.


Frank Rothman, chairman and chief executive officer of MGM/UA, said, ""The filmmakers did not intend to offend. All of us are sorry.""


The disclaimer, presently being issued to movie theaters in Los Angeles and New York, will be attached to the beginning of the film. It reads:


""This film does not intend to demean or ignore the many positive features of Asian American and specifically Chinese American communities. Any similarities between any depictions in the film and any association, organization, individual or Chinatown that exists in real life is accidental.""


After Rothman approached Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo, a negotiating committee was formed, consisting of Los Angeles Asian American community leaders and media activists. After about a week of meetings, MGM/UA and the committee agreed to the apology and disclaimer.


National Asian American media groups, including the National Asian American Telecommunications Association, advocate removal of ""Year Of The Dragon"" from future video cassette and cable television distribution. Another demand is for MGM/UA to hire an Asian American in a managerial position, to be accountable to the Asian American community. Negotiations are continuing with a committee that now includes national Asian American representatives.


In a related development, the Federation of Chinese Organizations of America and the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of North, Central and South America have filed a $100 million class action suit against director Michael Cimino, producer Dino De Laurentiis and MGM/UA for depicting the Chinese community as dominated by organized crime. They also seek a court order prohibiting the distribution of the film.


In particular, the plaintiffs, who represent more than 60 Benevolent Associations throughout the Americas, are suing over the use of a Benevolent Association building decorated with their characters. In the film, the building is portrayed as headquarters for Chinese organized crime.


Locally, the Seattle Alliance of Chinese Association will issue a public statement denouncing the content of ""Year Of The Dragon."" Hing Chin, member of the organization, said they are opposed to the film ""giving Chinatown a bad name.""


""We want to let the outside community know that Asians don't condone these types of movies,"" he said.

WASHINGTON -- It's probably the superior health of Asians and Pacific Islanders who compose much of Hawaii's population that has made that island the healthiest state in the union, according to the Population Reference Bureau.


Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders totaled 61 percent of Hawaii's population in 1980, and that state has the lowest infant mortality rate and the highest life expectancy rate of all the states, according to the bureau.


PRB also reported that Hawaiin women live to an average age of 80.3 years, and non-white women in Hawaii lead the nation in life expectancy, while males there live to be 74.1.


""Hawaii's top-ranked figures on infant mortality and life expectancy reflect the high proportion of Asian and Pacific Islander population in the state,"" said Carl Haub, the study's author.


""On life expectancy, Hawaii ranks with the world's leaders such as Iceland and Japan,"" he told the San Francisco Chronicle.


California ranked 20th in life expectancy: 78 years for women and 71.1 years for men. The state was ninth in infant mortality with 99 for every 10,000 births.

While details of the arrests are still sketchy, Regina Lee of Legal Services, a legal aid agency for the Asian community, said that three men between the ages of 18 and 21 were arrested this week. Also in police custody is a 16-year-old male. They are all believed to be white.


Hung Hua, 22, was watching TV with his aunt on Saturday morning when two men broke through a window screen and climbed into the apartment.


Chasing the intruders outside, Hua was then attacked by several others. About 30 people had congregated outside the apartment building. Police are looking for about 10 other suspects.

The word is out more fully about the latest movie cause celebre: the casting of caucasian actor Joel Grey as an Asian in a co-starring role in a forthcoming film. The picture is ""Remo Williams and the Secret of Sinanju,"" to be premiered Oct. 11. The Orion multi-million-dollar production, it is hoped, will be ""the first in a long-running series a la James Bond,"" according to writer Will Murray in the July issue of Starlog. Hero Remo Williams is a New York cop serving a secret U.S. government agency, CURE. Both writer Chris Wood and director Guy Hamilton have been heavily involved in previous James Bond films. Fred Ward, so good as astronaut Virgil Grissom in ""The Right Stuff,"" will play the lead.


But now for the clinker.


""Difficult was the casting of Reno's trainer, mentor and demanding father figure Chiun, the 80-year-old Korean master of the mythical art of Sinanju--the original martial art,"" continues Murray's article. ""Asian actors -- were interviewed unsuccessfully until a happy stroke of inspiration on (producer) Larry Spiegel's part produced the name of Oscar winner Joel Grey. Aided by makeup artist Carl Fullerton, by all reports Grey is Chiun. But fans...will have to wait until the film hits the silver screen to see for themselves. Orion has imposed a strict publicity blackout on all photographs of Grey as the cheeky Chiun.""


Despite the producer's inability to find a suitable Asian actor for the major part of the 80-year-old martial arts expert, this writer can think of at least four possibilities. Pat Morita received an Oscar nomination for the portrayal of a similar role in ""The Karate Kid,"" will soon appear in a sequel, and is a hit on best-selling video cassettes of the picture. Mako is still alive and well with East-West Players in Los Angeles. Wood Moy, so good on stage and screen, is still in San Francisco. And there is of course the great Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, though he might find such an assignment somewhat light-weight. These are by far not the only Asian actors of talent and stature. Just how hard did the producers of ""Remo Williams and the Secret of Sinanju"" look?

Fukuyama brought 40 of his paintings to the U.S. for the exhibition, many of which recapture scenes of his childhood in the then-rural farmlands near Tokyo, now business and residential suburbs, ""pastoral recollections of a placid rural Japan that no longer exists."" Also in the exhibit: paintings inspired by a long bicycle journey through the islands: fishing for loaches, fields, orchards, mothers and children walking in the countryside. After his retirement as town chief from a small Tokyo suburb, the artist devoted his time completely to painting, and is also famous for his Sumi paintings of Mount Fuji.

New Film From India


""The Home and the World"" (1984), the latest film from the great Indian director Satyagit Ray, is a fascinating period piece which has a lot to say about women's lives even now, let alone opportunism in politics. Taken from a 1912 Rabindranath Tagore novel, the film centers on a romantic triangle: an idealistic maharajah, played by Victor Banerjee (Dr. Aziz in ""A Passage to India""); the innocent, purdah-bound wife he decides to make a modern woman (a superb performance by beautiful Swatilekha Chatterjee), and his friend, a political leader of the campaign against the British (Soumitra Chatterjee, who played the title role in ""The World of Apu""). The hero, as naive as his wife, exposes her to the rhetoric and womanizing of his friend, leader of the Swadeshi campaign against foreign-made goods, and she succumbs both to the politics and the man. For a time. (You really know he's no good when you first see him light up a Players cigarette -- British made.) For he's an ""end justifies the means"" politico, who always travels first class on trains.


How true the politics of the pre-Grandhian period are in this film, I don't know. Were, for example, the landlords Hindu, the oppressed peasants Muslim, in early Bengal? What was author Tagore's own position at that time on Indian independence?


Nevertheless the human drama is very convincing indeed, and the last closeup of the heroine, dressed in widow's white, can still be seen in the mind.


A Western Film


""Explorers"" is the most charming of the new crop of juvenile science fiction films, and if I were 10 years old. I would be in ecstasies about it. Even grown up I found it very enjoyable. For one thing, the crew of three kids who build their own space ship and meet the extra-terrestrials are individualized and believable. (One says, ""We're going to go where no man has gone before,"" and there are lots of other in-jokes for the (sci-fi fans). The ETs are something different too, but I won't give away their secret. There's a warmth and charm about director Joe Dante's work here which seemed to me quite lacking earlier (like in ""Gremlins""), and ""Explorers,"" though flawed by sometimes too dark scenes, in which you can't be sure what's happening, and dialogue which is occasionally inaudible, is a family film in the best sense of the word. Go for it.

I swore it would not devour me.


I swore it would not humble me.


I swore it would not break me.


Amy Nikaitani


""Breaking the Silence,"" a theatrical performance blending education, politics and history, will be held May 25 at the University of Washington as a fundraiser for Gordon Hirabayashi, the man who resisted the internment order against Japanese Americans during World War II.


Researcher, writer and producer Nikki Louis draws on letters and journals, documentary materials, interviews and poetry to represent the authentic voices and viewpoints of Japanese Americans.


The production is a project of the Japanese American Citizen League's Committee to Reverse the Japanese American Wartime Cases. The committee, co-chaired by Diane Narasaki and attorney Roger Shimizu, was formed to publicize and raise funds for Hirabayashi's legal petition to overturn his 1942 conviction. His conviction stemmed from a decision to violate curfew as a act of civil disobedience against the U.S. government.


Hirabayashi, granted an evidentiary hearing which will be held June 17 in Federal District Court, will argue that the government suppressed and destroyed evidence attesting to the loyalty of Japanese Americans.


The theatrical performance, according to Louis, embodies the gradual and painful ""breaking of silence"" by the Japanese American community to attain empowerment after internment.


""It is uncommon for the Nisei to discuss their humiliating experience with the Sansei,"" Louis said. ""Given a cultural background where stoicism and respect for authority are strongly adhered to, and a strong faith in the United States of America, we have kept silent and, therefore, not shared with the Sansei. The civil rights movement of the 1960s helped the Sansel urge the Nisei to break the silence.""


""Breaking the Silence"" covers a broad range of experiences: the Issei, the first generation immigrants of the 1880s, who had dreams and aspirations about a land of opportunity; the Nisei, the second generation who experienced the World War II camps; and the Sansei, the third generation who break the silence in struggling for civil rights.


John Mifsud directs the performance, Denise Ford is artistic consultant and Paige Wheeler is musical composer.


The multi-generational cast of ""Breaking the Silence"" includes: Harry Fujita, a Nisei from Northern California who served in the Military Intelligence Service during World War II; Tomo Shoji, a Nisei evacuated from Los Angeles and interned at Manzanar; Bea Kiyohara, a Sansei and artistic director of Northwest Asian American Theatre; Nikki Louis, interned at Minidoka; David Kobayashi; Ellen Ebata; Gregg Hashimoto; Ken Mochizuki; and Leslie Ishii'. Actor and activist John Gilbert narrates ""Breaking the Silence.""


The script - lively, moving, often humorous -- incorporates tanka poetry, a traditional form of poetry with 31 syllables. The performance includes poetry by Gregg. Hashimoto's grandmother, Teiko Tomita.


""We often use tanka poetry as statements within themselves and as transitions for the different segments of the play,"" Louis explained. ""It was often a refreshing release to create tanka poetry during and after hard labor as the Japanese performed jobs that the whites did not want to do.""


Louis quoted Tama Tokuda, a local writer and member of the Nippon Kan Heritage Association, who said, ""The nice thing about growing old is that you get to see things go full circle.""


""I have had the opportunity to have advantages my mother did not have,"" Louis said. ""I see the possibility of change. I can also see patterns.""


Louis's grandmother, Kinoe Nakatsu, wrote a poem that is used in the performance:


Now that the testing of the pioneer is over The door to the moon is open. Oh, the human spirit, it is limitless.


The May 25 production will be held 7:30 p.m. at the University of Washington HUB auditorium. For donations and ticket orders, call 323-1868 or write E.R.E., 201 W. Olympia P1. #307, Seattle 98119.

OAKLAND -- Two emerging groups of concerned Filipino Americans in the Bay Area are in dire need of the community's support and assistance to achieve their common goal of documenting the history and various aspects of immigrant life in this country.


With the traditional sources of funding for minority advocate groups fast disappearing, the Institute for Filipino Resource and Information is launching a campaign to raise an undetermined amount of money to keep the newly-formed organization operational.


In San Francisco the 16-member group of Bay Area Filipino American writers is seeking support from the community and other nonprofit organizations to document the experiences of Filipino immigrants.


""We do need tax-deductible donations from individuals who can help with any amount to build this much-needed institution,"" said Inday . . ., a volunteer IFRI organizer.


The IFRI was organized in 1982 as an information resource and research clearing house after several universities scrapped their programs in Asian American studies. Three major universities in the western U. S. -- University of California, University of Washington and University of Hawaii -- have trimmed their budgets in ethnic studies, resulting in complete phase out orpartial discontinuance of program on Filipino American affairs.


The resource group, manned by three volunteers, is taking advantage of the holiday season to solicit direct contributions. This week the non-profit IFRI plans to mail out hundreds of letters seeking financial support from various community organizations and individuals to raise funds for its various projects.


In a six-page brochure the IFRI noted that during the last eight decades of Filipino immigration to the United States, the community's population has grown to about 800,000 based on statistical estimates. Other groups believed that the count could even go up to 1.5 million.


The IFRI also observed that while scholars have taken note of the Filipino American role and contributions to this country, ""the wealth of information on Filipinos in the U. S. is generally untapped.""


""In addition, the sizeable collections of periodicals, books, theses and pamphlets are not readily accessible and available to the Filipino community,"" the IFRI said.


Some of the major components of the group's program are to establish a network of information, coordinate with other research institutions, collect unpublished theses and dissertations, and publish documents on history, culture and politics of Filipino immigrants.


Aside from these projects the group intends to assist interested parties in acquiring information available in other institutions.


Reti said the funds will be used mainly to operate the IFRI, with the balance earmarked for the procurement of books, films and periodicals. The group has successfully sponsored two major projects including the exhibit of the works of artist Ben Cabrera and other visual display in Oakland.


Writers Club


The writers association organized two years ago, is facing monumental problems, ranging from lack of funds to virtual absence of community patronage


Virginia Cereno, the unofficial spokesperson of Filipino American writers club, said their efforts have been hindered by limitations in marketing.


""Filipino Americans don't buy books. It is hard to get money, particularly in a situation when the community does not fully support these efforts,"" Cereno lamented.


Cereno and her friends acknowledged that publishing literary works faces tough competition. The group, however, was able to win an award from the Zellerbach Family Fund which led their effort to have their works published in an anthology called Breaking Silence. The book, published last year, has eight Filipino American writers in the collection.


According to Cereno, the Writers group will open its membership to other Asian American writers.

BERKELEY -- A sizeable percentage of Asian residents are not getting enough and equitable share in the City of Berkeley's public housing assistance program designed to partially combat the widespread poverty in the East Bay, a social worker charged.


With 29.2 percent of this city's Asian residents living below the poverty line the combined community of Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians and East Indians received less than 5 percent of the low income housing units allocated by the city government.


The city, through a lottery conducted by an Oakland group, spared just one unit for an Asian family fast year despite findings that the community has the highest poverty level.


The 62 units of public housing were awarded without the city properly informing other minority groups, largely Asians and Hispanics, of the program's availability, a spokesman complained.


The Asian and Hispanic groups were informed of the project two days before the deadline for submission of applications City Manager Daniel Boggan extended the grace period for another 15 days.


Dr. Tony Leong, executive director of Asians for Job Opportunities in Berkeley, a community service agency known as AJOB, is mounting a campaign to secure an equal share in the new low-income housing program recently apploved by the city council.


In petition letters sent to Mayor Gus Newport and city council members, Leong noted that during the past decade the Asian residents represent ""the fastest and largest growing population in the city.""


""While other populations in the City of Berkeley either decreased or remained the same, the Asian population grew to 9.6 percent of the general population in 1980,"" Leong explained. The population growth rate eflects almost 100 percent increase in 10 years.


Aside from findings indicating the Asian community has the highest rate of poverty in the city, 90 percent of Asian immigrants and refugees from Southeast Asia who sought assistance and shelter through AJOB are ""on public assistance or fall below the poverty line,"" Leong said.


Since 1974 AJOB has attended to almost 5,000 Asians who sought employment, training and other social service assistance during the first stages of resettlement in Berkeley.


""The Berkeley Asian community has consistently and traditionally received a comparatively lower amount of funding because of our positive stereotype,"" Leong said.


This observation refers to the portrayal of Asian immigrants as ""successful minorities."" As a result of this general perception, various government agencies dealing with social welfare problems failed ""to consider the Asian community as being a socio-economically disadvantaged community.""


Leong recalled that in 1974 he was told by a Berkeley city official that ""Asian don't need jobs, they're all rich and well-educated.""


AJOB also learned that the city council has just approved a 75-unit housing project costing approximately $1.4 million. Some $670,000 of the total funding will come from community development block grant and other sources like municipal loans and budget savings.


Boggan said the funds, earmarked for South Berkeley Revitalization Project, are allocated to site acquisition, business assistance, job development and small business loans.


""None of this $210,391 will be used specifically for Asian and Raza (Hispanic) communities located in the west end of Berkeley,"" Leong added.


While requesting the city to set aside portions of the community development monies for economic, housing and public services assistance for Asians and Hispanics, Leong noted that the two groups have been ""characteristically shoved aside to serve one segment of the city.""


Leong also pointed out that AJOB has suffered a huge reduction in its funding, around 54 percent. An unidentified newly formed service agency in the southern portion of the city has just received $200,000, he claimed.


The AJOB petition said Asians and Hispanics should enjoy portions of carry-over funds because most of them also qualify as underprivileged minorities.


The group demanded that an increased number of housing units be given to the poor families of the two minority groups.


AJOB further asked the city council to translate the housing application notices into Spanish and the eight other major Asian languages to allow the non-English and limited English-speaking minorities to avail of the housing opportunities.

HOLLYWOOD -- Whites in yellowface are making a comeback on the silver screen.


Negotiations are underway for Faye Dunaway to play Madame Mao. Joel Grey spends four hours daily getting made up as an aged Koean kung-fu master. Amy Irving was transformed into an east Asian princess for last year's TV production of ""The Far Pavilion.""


Asian American artists once rejected yellowface as degrading. Today they speak of the freedom of all artists to expand their craft -- but they believe the price of this freedom has been a distorted view of who Asian Americans relaly are.


Maxine Hong Kingston, author of the ""The Woman Warrior"" and ""Chinamen,"" says, ""I feel concerned when I look at my nephews and nieces -- young people -- and see how hard it must be to see themselves as attractive people."" She notes that the media often portrays Asians in the narrowest way.


Describing first-hand the impact of media stereotypes, Don Magwili, now artistic director of the San Francisco-based Asian American Theater Company, tells of using eyebrow pencil to prepare for auditions because ""I was afraid my eyes weren't slanted enough. I really didn't trust the way I looked.""


Actor Mark Hayashi says that, in commercial entertainment and in the larger society, Asian Americans are ""not looked upon as men."" In a lot of ways, he continues, ""I look on Asian American men as the eunuchs of this country. We put a tremendous amount of high-tech responsibility on them. They do their duty.""


Ironically, for Hayashi, the advent of martial arts films -- criticized by some for their glamorization of machismo -- represented a real turning point. ""The big historical change in my life is Bruce Lee. I think he is one of the most positive images of Asian Americans in 50 to 100 years. It's great to grow up in high school with Bruce Lee around.""


Though Hayashi was widely acclaimed for his performance in Wayne Wang's ""Chan Is Missing,"" most Asian American performers remain virtually unknown.


Many believe this has implications for Asian Americans in all professions, who are often bypassed for promotion to positions of authority. Says Diane Wong, editor of a new anthology of Asian American women writers. ""Stereotypes are limiting the opportunities for Asian Americans, not so much from the Asian American point of view, but by people who make decisions about what we can do.""


Theater and film workers acknowledge that in Hollywood artistic ethics are dwarfed by economics. Filmmaker Arthur Dong, whose documentary ""Sewing Woman"" was nominated for an Academy Award, notes that Faye Dunaway is ""one of my favorite actresses."" Casting her as Madame Mao might be offensive, he says, but he understands it as a commercial decision. ""If you're going to recreate 1948 revolutionary China you're going to need millions of dollars. Who's going to give you millions of dollars for Beulah Quo?"" naming a veteran actress.


When Asian American performers do get hired for mainstream productions, they sometimes find themselves playing the very stereotypes they revile -- Hayashi was cast as a brutal Japanese sergeant in ""Tales of the Golden Monkey."" As Lucie Cheng, director of UCLA's Asian American Studies Center, observes, ""It's not a question of Asians playing Asian roles, but rather what Asian roles are being portrayed. It's important to ask what are the roles the media has for Asians.""


Almost all Asian American artists think media decision-makers fail to distinguish between the many races, and between immigrants and native-born. This unwillingness to recognize diversity reflects and reinforces ignorance in the general public, they believe. The brutal murder of Vincent Chin -- a Chinese American beaten to death by two unemployed auto-workers in Detroit who thought he was Japanese -- is an alarming sign of this ""color-blindness.""


Though recent immigrants have been portrayed in films like. ""The Killing Fields"" and ""Alamo Bay,"" native-born Asian Americans rarely appear. Their invisibility could encourage their ""disappearance"" into the white culture, Kingston comments, adding. ""When you destroy the language, or are trying to get rid of your accent, that means a heavy price has been paid in trying to be an American.""


""I've lived in Hawaii for many years now where Asians aren't in the minority. It makes me feel really wonderful when you see Asians and Asian Pacifics playing Ibsen and Shakespeare . . . get relaly upset (when) I am in Hollywood, and I see them taping the eyes of whites back to appear Asian. In Hawaii, we can see an Asian guy playing Hamlet or a Chinese girl playing Anne Frank, and nobody thinks it's weird,"" she says.


The media's insistence on defining Asian Americans on its own terms, or ignoring them completely, has fired many Asian American artists to respond by creating their own culture. They have focused particularly on changing the portrayal of Asian women -- so often seen as exotic sex objects, manipulative villainesses or docile drones.


In their work, these artists also stand for Asian Americans who reject the view of a well-behaved ""model minority."" Dom Magwill is directing ""Zatoichi Superstar,"" an adventure-comedy which parodies the images of evil villains, Zen samurai and deadly assassins. Wayne Wang wants ""to tell moving stories about real people who are complex.""


Rather than idealize their community, these artists seek to illuminate its depth and breadth. They are willing to laugh at themselves, and are committed to redefining and expanding the Asian American culture -- in keeping with its ethnic and generational diversity. ""If there's got to be a definition,"" emphasizes filmmaker Curtis Choy, ""it's to make it as wide as possible.""


""It seems to me a lot of people are rebelling against the labels,"" says Kingston.

Haing S. Ngor, winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Dith Pran in ""The Killing Fields"" was the key-note speaker last Saturday at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall, for a ""Cambodian Symposium"" sponsored by Amnesty International.


The 35-year-old Ngor granted an exclusive interview with Asian Week, whose reporter picked him up at the airport and drove him to the symposium. Along the way Ngor offered these thoughts and observations about himself and the situation in Cambodia today.


On his work as a job developer in Southern California: ""I work with the county and also the state. Not only Cambodian people. We have also Indochinese people, Armenian people, Cuban, Australian and Afghanistan people. The first time I get in the U.S. my cousin found the job for me. I applied to the job and since in the U.S., I work four and a half years already. My cousin, he's here since 1975.""


On family in America: ""No, not really. My blood family almost all killed by Khmer Rouge already, but I have a few relatives here. I have no wife here. My wife get killed by Khmer Rouge already.""


On his leadership role: ""I didn't think I was the leader of the Cambodian community, but yes, for the West Coast, I'm the president of the Cambodian Association, but for the last couple years, not really have enough activities to help that community because I got more business. So very busy to do that job. I work for Cambodian humanitarian organizations, that mean to sponsor whole family from the border to the U.S.""


On the future: ""I will do some more film if we get it. If they not have it, I go back to school to practice my medical background again. It's really a bit hard for an American because right now the difficulty is depend on my English. If I thought my English strong or good enough, I would pass tomorrow the exam. Now: will have to go back and get BA or MA and then go to pass medical exam, no. Because I got a lot of recommendations from my professor in France and also in U.S. too. I have been accepted to UCLA.""


On changes due to the ""Killing Fields"": ""Change. Oh, I couldn't believe my life change so much. Just last night we had a lot of people who said, ""Hey you are (Haing S. Ngor),' I said, ""Yes I am. But in the movie I didn't wear glasses. Why you remember I'm in 'The Killing Fields?' They said, 'You look like.'""


On why so many Cambodians live in California: ""Yes, basically in Long Beach and Orange County, because you know the Cambodian custom like to live together because of the big problem. In my country before 1975, a lot of educated people. In 1975-1979, Khmer Rouge killed, almost finished my race, my nation. All educated people killed by Khmer Rouge, so right now there is really a small number of educated people. We have a lot of uneducated people. Right now, my people want to live together because they know how to have the contact, discuss the problem.""


On Khmer Rouge: ""You have white skin, cut your throat. You have glasses, cut. You have black skin, you soldier, come on. Every layer of society they kill them. And if you are educated people, they say to you, go there and work. But work too hard. They say to the Khmer Rouge, 'Why work so hard.' They kill you. You educated people. I tell you one thing, any type of Communist, if they say something, don't believe. Don't trust them, but if they did something, be careful of your life. Any kind of thing they did to you, be careful of your life. Everybody trust them because my country people they don't like fighting, they don't like war. They want to reunite family. Like my family, they lost contact between 1975 and 1979 between the small city and the big city. They lost contact because the Khmer Rouge cut it off, all highways, all freeways, any kind of street between the small cities and the big city, the capital. So we lost contact. Not only my family, but your family, my niece's family. Every family lost contact. They want to unite. They don't want to fight. They don't want to see the war the wounded people, to see the killed people. They don't want to see it.""


On ""The Killing Field's"" impact in Cambodia: ""They didn't see the movie, but they heard about the 'Killing Fields.' I hope. Because we have the Voice of America broadcast by Cambodian language. I hope they know, they heard about 'The Killing Fields.'""


On Vietnam: ""In 1978, 1979, I feel happy and I thank the Vietnamese government. They save my life from the jungle, from the Khmer Rouge, and yes I thank him very much. But not let him stay too long. You have to back to your country, let me thank you later. Really bad right now. He want to destroy biologically my country. They don't like my people to marry with Cambodian people. So that mean he want to destroy my people biologically. I feel very bad right now because he stay too long, but he said he want to save my people, but I didn't think so because every Christmas time he fight the Cambodian people around the Thai-Cambodian border. Right now they fight and he kill a lot of Cambodian people. That mean he want to save my people? No. Nothing. Not only Cambodia, but Laos and South Vietnam. They want to control all. They want to control all Indochinese. You know the background of the Vietnamese government or the Vietnamese people. Before a long time ago, they have their own country very small, but the Vietnamese government and the Vietnamese people want to fight. They want some war. They like war. They like fight.""


On jobs for the Cambodians here in the U.S.: ""A lot of welfare people went to school to learn English background for job training, vocational training. They got a lot of good benefits too in Los Angeles. Here, I hope the same.""


On Returning To Cambodia: ""We have 60 percent that want to go back, and around 20 percent who want to go only to visit, and about 20 percent that don't want to go. Because they know about the harrowing experience. They are survivors who know about the harrowing atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. It's very crazy for the Cambodian people. They don't want to see.""


On Cambodians' future: ""All Cambodians here are very very comfortable. They feel very happy. They didn't hear about the bombs. They didn't hear about the shelling. They didn't hear about the killing. They didn't see the killed people. They didn't see the killed people so they are very happy. Where you want to go? Anywhere they want to go. Freedom. Yesterday in Los Angeles, today in Oakland. So how to go there to Cambodia? Why I have to go? In Cambodia, go, the soldiers come. You got pass? You don't have pass? Why you go there? That's a problem?""

LOS ANGELES -- Civic and state officials told of billions of dollars in government contracts for which Asian American-owned businesses can compete.


Eunice Sato, city council-woman and former mayor of Long Beach, delivered the keynote address to the Asian Business Association on the topic, ""How to Link Up with Long Beach."" She said the city has an annual budget of $1 billion and that ABA members should compete in bidding to capture some of that business.


Also speaking before the group was Clayton Fong, community liaison for Gov. George Deukmejian. Fong said the state invites bids for more than $2 billion in contracts annually, and the governor's office is actively seeking to open channels of communication with the Asian American communities and promote greater participation.


""To the Asian community, just opening the doors is not always comfortable. They are a little extra cautious, a little extra proud, especially in relation to government programs,"" Fong said.


Lynne Choy Uyeda, who owns a corporate promotions company, gave a short talk on the role of a consultant in today's business world.


The 150-member ABA held its monthly meeting at the beautiful new Syieon Restaurant, which specializes in Korean cuisine. Meetings are held at a wide variety of Asian restaurants.


The ABA is a non-profit organization founded in 1979 by Dale Fukamaki and a small group of entrepreneurs with the assistance of Security Pacific National Bank. The ABA's main objective is to help Asian American-owned businesses get into the mainstream of commerce.

OAKLAND -- The city's selection committee adopted Monday all the conditions requested by the Coaltion for Chinatown Development to be applied in the choice of a developer.


A day later the East Bay Municipal Utilities District voted 4-0 with three abstentions to have its part of the construction done by C & L Financial.


Earlier this month the coalition of nine Asian American organizations wrote to the City Council and to EBMUD complaining that it was not included in the process of selecting a developer, and listing conditions to its acceptance of either C&L or its rival, Oakland Chinatown Plaza Inc./Sumitomo.


In a meeting with the coalition, the four members present from the five-member selection committee agreed informally to adopt both the general conditions for both developers, and the specific conditions for each developer as worked out by the coalition with only minor changes in the wording.


EBMUD Board President Sanford Skaggs said that though the directors had voted to choose C & L, they were willing to discuss the choice with the city, suggesting that EBMUD will not be intransigent if the council . . . OCPI/Sumitomo.


The Office of Economic Development and Employment which has supervised research for the selection, will make its recommendation to the city council on Oct. 3.


""What we have to do now,"" said Diane Yamashiro-Omi, recording secretary of the coalition, ""is to get the conditions formalized through a vote of the City Council.""

""Zatoichi Superstar!""


I've never seen anything quite like this ""Zen samurai comedy"" by Warren Kabota, currently being presented by the Asian American Theater Company in world premiere. The only thing I can compare it to is Mime Troupe's long-ago ""Terry and the Pirates,"" and that mainly because this work has its own ""Dragon Lady"" and also an almost comic-strip format, as well as being lots of fun.


But the Mime Troupe production was primarily political satire: ""Zatoichi"" is richer, for it has more elements. Zen made funny, but also with underlying truth, social criticism, with telling blows at racism; culture clash between Eastern and Western attitudes, strong feminism, and a real attack on bigoted Moral Majority type ""Christianity,"" as well as the color and hokum of popular samurai movies.


Opening with a dialogue on a park bench between a Zen master and a bum, which somehow recalls ""Waiting for Godot,"" it soon introduces other characters Yuki, a yuppie type Westernized Japanese American youth, whom one of the women in the play justly calls a ""chauvinist holy roller""; Ichi, who is really Zatoichi, the miraculous blind swordsman of many samurai films; thoroughly modern Sumiko, who's into jogging and sexual freedom; and her sister Hisako, a dragon Iady if there ever was one, who's out for power, willing to kill, and treats her henchmen like dogs. (One of them, true to the role, sits up and begs for her in a very canine fashion.)


I loved almost all of these characters the witty, sexy and very metaphysical Zen Master (William Ellis Hammond); the bum; who, surprisingly turns out to be female, and something more (Fay Kawabata); the gallant, mystical blind swordsman (Hiroshi Kashiwagi, and another excellent performance); flip, gutsy, honest foxy Sumiko (Sharon Iwai), and dragon Iady Hisako (Emilya Cachapero, torrid as a burlesque queen or a poor man's Cleopatra, in the kind of performance I've never seen from her before. It's a wonder she didn't set the stage on fire.)


I hated the wimp-bigot portrayed by John Shin, but in the end even he became human, and earlier he had been an excellent foil for the other characters.


Set, sound, lights were fine, and Top Tawashis costumes excllent, particularly Emilya Cachapero's sexy gear.


Dom Magwili, AATC's new artistic director, and John Shin co-directed, and made this an excellent ensemble production A thoroughly enjoyable theatrical performance, wonderfully funny -- and something more.


""Zatoichi Superstar!"" may be seen at the People's Theatre Coalition, Fort Mason Center, Building B. San Francisco, Thurs. Sat. 8 p.m., Sundays 3 and 7 p.m. Phone 776-8999 for reservations, information.


""In My Mind's Eye""


This Drama-Logue prize-winning play by Doug Haverty, now in the Northern California premiere at Berkeley's West End Rep, is family entertainment in the best sense of the term.


Its heroine, whom we meet as a teenager and as an adult, is legally blind but determined to lead a normal life. She is written with inteligence, sensitivity and humor, and at no point do we view her as ""disabled."" She goes through regular high school, regular college, becomes a teacher in a regular school, and wins a loving relationship with a regular man, who's as sensitive as she, and as gifted with humor.


Other major relationships in her life are, as a teenager, with an old man with whom she builds a loving friendship; with her high school principal, a feisty, warm-hearted, attractive woman (as portrayed by a fine black actress, Eugenia Sands, who adds dimension to the role; one realizes she too has had to struggle against double odds, being a woman and a member of a minority); and with her mother, devoted, loving, strong-willed and over-possessive, which also entails a struggle on the heroine's part.


The mother-daughter relationship, a blend of affection and anger, is excellently depicted. Any female only-child with a single parent who has ""lived for her, will realize its truth.


Equally effectively captured are the other relationships, even that with her unseen students, to whom she speaks facing the audience. At one point she, kimono-clad, greets them in Japanese fashion and demonstrates a tea ceremony, to enrich their perceptions of other cultures, in a charmingly mimed sequence.


The heroine as young girl and young woman is well portrayed by two different actresses. Teenage Kim Todd earlier portrayed a memorable Juliet for the company, and her maturing talent is evident here. Gina Gregoline makes her Berkeley acting debut as the older hereoine in fine style. Jill Cagan is excellent as the mother, who has her own problems and weaknesses, but underneath a strong abiding love for her daughter. Sean Kirkwood Robinson, one of the founders of the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival captures the gruff humor and tenderness of the old man who befriends the girl, and Grant Machan is the teacher who loves her as a real woman and an equal. Eugenia Sands is warm and compassionate as her principal.


The sets by Meredith Lynn Reckner are simple and functional, Jeff Brittling's incidental music adds a lot, and sound by Glenn Davidson and Joan Pulsipher enhances the drama. Patricia Leslie's fine direction makes this a real ensemble production, humorous, poignant, and imaginative.


This is never more, evident than in the scene in which the young girl dances with the old man while her older self dances with her lover. It had a kind of magic.


The only flaw I found was, rarely, an inability to hear Ms. Sands.


But this play, which brings back the memories of youth to an older audience and recreates youth itself for the younger, is a profile in courage, with three-dimensional characters and rich, complex humanity under its seeming simplicity.

""The Visions of Simone Machard""


This Tour de Force production of a rarely presented drama by Bertolt Brecht is remarkable for its multi-ethnic cast and its very good stage movement. It is a It is a play of constant confrontation. Its heroine, teenage worker in an inn in a French village during World War II, facing the Nazi invasion, is a naive idealist, whose imagination (aided by an old book she constantly reads) tells her that she is Joan of Arc reincarnated. This gets her into toruble with almost everybody; the venal inkeeper she works for (effectively portrayed by Chris Ayles); other townspeople either cowardly or greedy; and of course the Germans, particularly after she blows up the gasoline which her employer has been selling on the black market. She ends by being sent to a lunatic asylum, the fate of those who hear voices in the 20th century.


Chinese American Jo Yang is very good as the innocent teenager. Actually a woman in her mid-20s, dressed in sweater skirt and bobby socks, and moving in an almost skipping fashion, she seems very young and innocent. The only problem is that she is not always audible.


This is not the problem with the other actors, who by and large are too audible and tend to express high and low emotion by shouting. (Exceptions: Chris Ayles, Raymond Tasco as an aged inn employee, Asian American Viola, Lucero as a Nazi officer, Michael Cawelti as a wounded poilu turned inn worker). Having the characters speak simultaneously doesn't help, and add to the high decibels makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible.


""The Visions of Simone Machard"" is being presented at Bethany Methodist Church, Fri.-Sun., 8 p.m., through June 16, Info from 641-8986.

LOS ANGELES -- City Councilman Mike Woo claimed a ""historic"" victory last week when the makers of ""Year of the Dragon,"" agreed to Asian Americans' demand to refute racist images in the movie.


Woo appeared at a press conference with Frank Rothman, chairman and chief executive officer of MGM/UA Entertainment Co., along with other members of the coalition that had sharply protested against the film in recent weeks. Woo represents Hollywood on the city council, and initiated negotiations with Rothman in response to the protests.


""Mr. Rothman and I are proud to announce that beginning this Labor Day weekend, a disclaimer will be added to 'Year of the Dragon.' The disclaimer will make, it clear that the persons, organizations and places portrayed in that film are in no way representative of any real Asian Pacific American community, specifically the Chinese community. It is rare for a movie studio to acknowledge its mistakes in such a forthright manner. The credit for this decision belongs to Frank Rothman.""


Woo emphasized that the studio not only has the addition of a disclaimer to a film with racist overtones, but has begun to seriously discuss a longer-term program which could prevent similar distortions and stereotypes in future productions.


Woo admitted there were serious problems involving gangs and drugs in Chinatown and other communities, and he added, ""We are not asking for reality to be coated with sugar, but we do want a balanced presentation of positives and negatives."" Woo pointed out that MGM/UA did not initiate ""Year of the Dragon"" but picked it up for distribution after it was completed by an independent producer.


""This film does not intend to demean or to ignore the many positive features of Asian Americans and specifically Chinese American communities. Any similarity between the depiction in this film and any association, organization, individual or Chinatown that exists in real life is accidental,"" is the disclaimer that will precede each screening of ""Year of the Dragon.""


Rothman continued that the studio was working diligently to print disclaimer film strips which will be sent to theaters throughout the country. He indicated that the studio had been in communication with the theater owners regarding the disclaimer and they were willing to cooperate.


Asian Week asked if MGM would consider also putting the disclaimer on their newspaper advertisements of the movie since it would have an immediate effect. Rothman replied that they had not considered it but would confer with his advertising people after the new conference.


Another reporter asked if MGM would have a psychologist on a panel of review films to see what psychdogical effect movies would have on the audience. Rothman adamantly refused, saying it would infringe on the First Amendment rights of free speech, Censorship would not be tolerated. Rothman indicated that input and consulting advice and assistance while movies are being made was not considered censorship.


""We have to be very much in tune with our responsibilities to the people, the public which I tried to address this morning, but also our responsibility is to our company, to our business, to our industry. Films must be commercially successful; if they're not, people aren't going to be working, so I believe it raises a legitimate point. We have to balance the line. But I will assure you that we will never, ever subject ourselves to censorship by any person, but that doesn't mean that we won't be responsible,"" Rothman said. At the time of the conference, the gross profit of the ""Dragon"" film had reached $10 million.

A 60-year-old building in the International District that formerly housed the Chinese Baptist Church may be renovated for use by community non-profit organizations as early as next spring.


The two-story brick building, located at 925 South King Street, was originally built to replace another church at 4th Avenue and Yesler Way. However, in 1977, a new Chinese Baptist Church was built on Beacon Hill. The King Street building was purchased by the American Legion in 1977 and six years ago by the Tices.


The Denise Louie Child Care Center, Employment Opportunities Center (EOC) and Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) plan to make an offer to the current owners, Lou and Diane Tice of the Pacific Institute, a company that teaches self-motivational skills, said Doug Chin of Seattle's Department of Community Development.


The offer is based on several contingencies, including the ability of the Child Care Center to raise $30,000 to help cover-rehabilitation costs. According to the offer, the Tices would pay for the church's renovation if the Center raised the money and agreed to pay $166 per month in rent and utilities, with EOC paying a monthly rent of $807 and Environmental Works occupying an adjoining portable for $332 in rent. The deadline for the Center to secure funding is December 10.


This is basically an ""agreement to agree,"" explained Chin, because there are several variables in the deal. If the Tices agree with the plan, Evergreen Legal Services would draw up a real estate lease for the Center and other project participants. The Tices would then borrow the money to fix up the church.


The Child Care Center is looking at three possible funding sources: 1) foundations, such as the Northwest Area Foundation or Pacific Northwest Bell; 2) the federal Headstart Program; and 3) Seattle City funds.


The Child Care Center first expressed interest in leasing the building this past summer. This coincided with the Institute's desire to move to a new warehouse. Bailey Gatzert Elementary School, where the Center has been for all its eight years, is being closed down by the Seattle School District.


Under the proposal, the PDA will manage the ""new"" building, previously used by the Institute to produce tapes and literature for the company. Total estimated cost of the renovation is $100,000.


Environmental Works, a private non-profit organization specializing in low-income and community housing projects, has done a feasibility study of the church and may also be the architects for the project.


Most of the work that needs to be done consists of bringing the building up to minimum code, mainly for the Child Care Center, said Jon Roise, construction manager. Some of the changes will be creating fire exits, a fire alarm system, putting in guardrails, handrails and doors, fixing windows, painting and installing two new bathrooms and patching up walls.


The work should take two to three months, said Roise. If the renovation plan is approved, it will be five to six months before occupancy. A general contractor will be hired to do the construction.


The Child Care Center will utilize 4,000 square feet of space in the church sanctuary, said Kathy Wong, director.


With the recent expansion to 50 children at the Center, Wong is happy and relieved that they've found a new home and didn't have to relocate outside the International District.


""The history of the ID is important to Denise Louie,"" she said. ""This is what people know. They know where to go, where to come to. This is their home, the center of their lives.""


Spaces for the offices should be ready as early as March, said Doug Chin, who plans to present the proposal to the Tices possibly this week. Funding is still uncertain for the Child Care Center, he said.


Chin said two more tenants are still being sought to fill 900 square feet of space, at about $8 per square foot, plus utilities. Call 625-4773.

WALNUT CREEK, Calif. -- Police are looking for a group of Chinese Buddhists suspected of releasing 200 turtles into San Pablo Reservoir.


Witnesses said 20 men in eight cars debarked at a boat ramp and held a brief ceremony, ""chanted in Chinese"" and threw the turtles in the water Saturday afternoon, the San Francisco Chronide reported.


Releasing the turtles with a prayer can bring lengevity and prosperity, Nick Wong, manager of the Celadon Restaurant told the newspaper. He said the ceremony was called ""Fong Sang.""


East Regional Park police officer Randy Peshon said there were bright red Chinese characters painted on the shells of the turtles.


The turtles were American box turtles and red ear sliders, neither of which is native to California, and the box turtles cannot survive in water, the paper said. About a quarter of the turtles were recovered and half have died of pneumonia.


If caught, those who released the turtles face up to six months in jail and a $1000 fine each for ""releasing animals into an unnatural habitat.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- A small pharmacy in Chinatown sells more lottery tickets than any other outlet in the state averaging nearly 6,000 a day.


The Ping Yuen Drugstore on Grant Avenue sold 776,661 tickets in the 132 days since the lottery opened Oct. 3, an average of 5,883 per day, according to the California State Lottery Commission.


Kam Wong, manager and pharmacist at Ping Yuen, said 99 percent of his customers are Chinese or Chinese Americans. He attributed the store's success to the fact that the Chinese like to gamble.


Another reason is the high winnings from Ping Yuen. ""We've had so many winners, I'm losing count,"" Wong said.


The commission said that 10 customers at Ping Yuen won $5,000 prizes in the lottery's first game, four were $10,000 winners in the second game and two were $25,000 winners in the third game. Wong and his customers are said to be eagerly awaiting Game #4.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Over 400 people attended the publication party for the book, ""Chinese Women of America: A Pictorial History"" by author Judy Yung held at the Chinese Culture Center recently.


Yung, a noted historian and scholar of Asian American studies and women's issues, was present at the party to autograph copies of her new book and narrate a 20-minute bilingual slide show on Chinese women of America.


The slide show was part of a short program held at the Culture Center's auditorium co-hosted by Gimmy Park Li, program manager at KNBR Radio, and Ellen Yeung, a board member of the Chinese Culture Foundation.


Yung's book chronicles the 150 years of history of Chinese women of America from early immigration to contemporary times through archival, historical and rare private photographs.


Yung pieced together archival research with oral histories and uncovered a unique story of Chinese women of America overcoming an oppressive society and becoming important contributors to family, community and American society at large.


The book is based on the acclaimed traveling exhibit, ""Chin Chinese Women of America, 1834-1982,"" which originated at the Chinese Culture Center in August 1983.


Yung said she hopes that the publication of ""Chinese Women of America"" ""is merely the beginning of our journey to uncover our buried past.""

MANILA -- Since the energy crisis many inventors have come forward with extravagent claims about fuel-efficient automobiles. Some have even claimed their cars ran on water.


Last month a Filipino engineer said his car could run on urine.


The new vehicle can also be powered with beer, coffee, tea, sea water, or just about anything else, with just ""a few drops of petrol"" to get it started, Daniel Dingle told Reuter news service.


Dingle spent three years working on his ""Dinglemobile,"" which utilizes a secret device to get 120 miles per gallon of water, he said. For only $250 he says he can convert your car to run on water simply by altering the piston rings and installing his device.


""How can I offer this to car manufacturers if it's a fraud,"" Dingle asked sceptical reporters. ""They'll find me out in one second.""


He allowed reporters to test drive the car, but not to examine its mechanism.


Dingle has also invented a ""fish charmer,"" which looks like a walkie-talkie, and a ""perpetual engine"" powered by magnets, but has not demonstrated them, Reuter said.

During the weekday, Tina Koyama works as an editorial writer for Metro. But on her own time, she tries to bring out her inner thoughts through poetry.


Koyama, one of the foremost Asian American published poets in the Northwest, says she's taken classes on meditation and hypnosis to get in the right frame of mind for creating poetry.


""Kids know how to do word association exercises and scribbling to bring the inner thoughts out,"" she says. But she had to take an Experimental College class to learn how.


Koyama often creates poems about family relations and memories of childhood.


But, as an Asian, she thinks she sometimes holds back in her writing -- or at least in publishing -- those personal thoughts involving her family or friends.


""You feel that you might affect or hurt them if it's published,"" she said. ""Or you might feel self-conscious about showing your writing if you think your readers will be non-poets and they wouldn't place your writing in the context of how poets write.""


Koyama doesn't think her poems are political, although she may be heading more in that direction.


""I recently wrote something about world politics and war,"" she says, ""but I felt uncomfortable.""


Writing a poem requires total commitment, she says. ""You can't be dishonest -- this is the scary part. For example, if I'm in a relationship with someone, I could think all kinds of things about the person and the relationship, but when I write a poem, I have to face up to the truth of what I really feel about it.""


Asked whether poetry is, therefore, self-centered, Koyama replied that some poets ""want to change the world, but I'd be just as happy if I could change my own life and learn to look at something differently.""


Koyama, a Franklin High School graduate, received her bachelor's and master's degrees in English and creative writing at the University of Washington.


""I thought of going into communications or something practical like that,"" she said, ""but then those grads weren't getting jobs, either.""


At first, Koyama concerned herself with fiction, but after working with renown poet Nelson Bentley at the UW, she decided that poetry is ""much more immediate."" She thinks that fiction involves too many rational processes such as deciding plot development and dialogue.


""I just thought some of my ideas would fit better in poetry,"" she says.


Koyama is fascinated by other forms of art as well. Although she doesn't write about specific pieces in galleries, she admires the way artists in other media may look at things -- and she especially envies artists who can master more than one medium, such as writing and painting.


Colleen McElroy, a Black English professor, exerted a great deal of influence over Koyama's work as her thesis advisor.


""She was a great teacher -- very challenging,"" she says. ""Not only did we read stuff like Yeats, but the lesser known minority writers as well.""


For her thesis, Koyama created a collection of 25 poems, including pieces on family and love, portraits, letters to people, and odd ways to look at the world.


""When you're in school, there's peer pressure to publish,"" Koyama says, ""but now I'm not in a hurry.""


Koyama is now trying to assemble a complete manuscript.


She has previously been published in ""Breaking Silence,"" an anthology of Asian American writers in the Greenfield Review; the Seattle Review; Willow Springs; Intro 13 and 14, two national student publications; and the King County Arts Commission's literary publications.


Although Koyama loves writing, the reading or performance of the work is something else.


""Finally, after six or seven years, I'm not a hysterical wreck before and after a public reading,"" she says. Koyama, a quiet person, confesses that, at first, she couldn't eat or drive and felt physically nauseous before performing her work in public.


""Some people have the energy and get off on what they're reading,"" she says. ""One enjoyable thing about reading is that you get a very immediate reaction from the audience and you know which parts work -- it helps with the aural effect. Prose may be beautiful, but poetry must sound good.""


Instead of just sitting by herself at home writing and wondering how she's doing, Koyama says she meets with five other poets -- including Sharon Hashimoto and Jim Mitsui -- once a month. ""There's peer pressure to write,"" she says, ""and sometimes exercises for fun. We bring our work and critique it together.""


Koyama advises young people that writing is not easy. ""They think that when the inspiration hits, the words just flow out,"" she says. ""But it's like playing a musical instrument -- you have to practice it. You can't have any romantic notions that you'll make money at poetry.""

A photo exhibit of Filipino women in America from 1870 to the present is an admirable attempt to capture a rich history, but, unfortunately, is not organized effectively enough to appeal to a general audience.


The photo exhibit first opened to the public on January 17 at Seattle University's Lemeiux Library. It will go on display at several other sites here in Seattle before touring California and the East Coast.


The exhibit begins with history of the Filipino women in the small villages of New Orleans in 1870, although documents as early as 1765 tell of the first Filipino men who ""jumped"" the Spanish galleons.


The Filipino villages were without Filipino women for two generations, forcing interracial marriages until the first Filipino women immigrated to the United States. This marked a significant period in the history of Filipinos in America.


The exhibit highlights all aspects of the women's role, in both the family and society. The women were the central force that kept the family unit together and they started organizations that preserved the Filipino culture in America.


Therefore, the viewer may, at first, find the exhibit quite dull because the women featured are ""ordinary"" people: housewives, field workers, students, laborers and beauty pageant contestants.


However, these special women were the ""stabilizing force"" in Filipino American communities throughout Hawaii, California and Washington,"" especially during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, after the Spanish-American War.


These women endured the discrimination and violence of that era and provide the backbone of Filipino Americans today. Their strength and endurance preserved the Philippine culture and family and established a place for Filipinos in American history.


Improving certain aspects of the exhibit could have made a significant difference in the quality of the photo exhibition. First the set-up was difficult to follow because the series of historical events occurring at the same time were poorly organized.


The narratives that accompanied the photos were informative, but needed to be more concise. However, several of the photo collections were rare and interesting because they related a story beyond the obvious pictorial setting.


But there were too many instances where the content of the exhibit was miscellaneous. At times, if seemed more like going through a giant family album where one must be familiar with the family or at least be interested in the family background.


Native jewelry and authentic clothing were among the displayed artifacts that enhanced the exhibition, but they left the viewer craving more. Additional artifacts would have made it more worthwhile.


Despite all of the shortcomings of the exhibit, it was a admirable attempt to trace the history of Filipino women in America and to share the discoveries with the rest of the nation. Unfortunately, the exhibit was not effective enough to attract more people than the usual crowd of Filipino heritage supporters.


If this photo exhibit could be utilized to educate or even stimulate the interests of the many young and older Filipino Americans in their rich and vivid history, and also attract casual viewers who know nothing about the Filipino culture, then this exhibit could be much more worthwhile.


The exhibit will be on display at Highline Community College from February 8 to March 7, at the University of Washington HUB Building on March 8 and 9, and the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library on March 31 through April 30.


For more information on the exhibit, contact Dorothy Cordova at Demonstration Project For Asian Americans at 322-0203.

The International Special Review District Board last week approved a controversial plan to demolish the old Bailey Gatzert Elementary School and replace it with 35 units of senior housing, a health clinic and a social service center.


The Board, which makes recommendations on all proposed land use changes in the International District, voted unanimously at its May 13 meeting to approve the demolition, the change-of-use and the conceptual design for the new project, the Leschi Center.


The $2.7 million proposal sponsored by the Indian Services Commission, calls for construction of a 35-unit, three-story elderly apartment building, a two-story structure for the Seattle Indian Center and a two-story clinic building for the Seattle Indian Health Board. The project would also provide 118 to 120 parking spaces at the site.


By voting to approve the project, the Review Board members -- George Shinbo, Irene Woo, Mark Jones and Benson Wong -- agreed that the proposed Leschi Center did not violate Review District regulations governing development on the east side of the District. The current regulations do not prohibit development of housing or social services in that area, but several representatives from the International District Economic Association (IDEA) had argued that the proposed project would create more low-income housing, conflicting with the overall goal of providing ""stable, mixed types of housing"" for the entire District.


Before the vote, Review Board members listened to presentations from Mike Marshall, executive director of the Indian Services Commission, and Tom Harader, the project architect. The Board also heard emotional statements of support and opposition from individuals in the audience.


Several IDEA representatives reiterated their opposition to the project. Tomio Moriguchi, owner of Uwajimaya, the largest store in the District, and Rodney Wong, attorney for IDEA, noted that currently 97 percent of the housing units in the District are low-income. The project, they told the Board, would contribute to the ""imbalance"" between low-income and market-rate housing.


""If there is an impact, who is going to pay the price?"" Moriguchi asked the Board.


Last month, IDEA, in an attempt to force the Commission to prepare a costly Environmental Impact Statement before proceeding with the project, argued unsuccessfully before the City Hearing Examiner that the project would have a significant adverse impact on the International District.


On April 29, Hearing Examiner Leroy McCullough rejected IDEA's appeal, ruling that the Commission's proposal for 35 new units of senior housing -- ranging in monthly rent from $100 to $450 -- could be ""a positive precedent for more housing of various economies.""


The ""increased residential and professional employee population"" resulting from the project, McCullough said ""will probably enhance District consumer activity.""


McCullough acknowledged that an architect had testified that the old school building contained several noteworthy ""artistic elements,"" including a ""curved entry door and owl gargoyles."" However, McCullough noted that the building has not been designated a historic landmark.


At the Review Board meeting, Rodney Wong repeated IDEA's position that the Review Board should seek to preserve existing structures in the District.


But Camille Monzon, director of the Seattle Indian Center, retorted, ""When are gargoyles and owls more important than a child that needs medical attention?""


JoAnn Kauffman, director of the Seattle Indian Health Board, and Carol Peloza, president of the Indian Services Commission, both told the Review Board that the project will benefit the International District. The Indian Health Board clinic, Kauffman said, will be a modern facility, not a ""storefront, ghetto-type operation."" And Peloza said she expects that the staff at the new center to shop in the immediate area and ""bring a lot of money"" into the District.


After taking brief comments from both supporters and opponents of the project, the Review Board voted. First, the Board passed a motion to issue a certificate of approval for demolition, with the understanding that the Commission would create a historic photo display of the school, reuse bricks and architecturally significant elements in the new development, and place a commemorative plaque on the grounds.


Second, the Board approved a motion to allow the change-of-use, with the stipulation that the Commission would take steps to ensure adequate security at the site.


Third, the Board approved the conceptual design for the project.


The Board will also write a letter urging the City Council to grant the Seattle Indian Center's request for funding to maintain a satellite daily hot meal program at a downtown site after the Center's program is relocated to the International District.


Meanwhile the Indian Services Commission faces an uphill battle to gain funding for the housing portion of the Leschi Center, which would be constructed under Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) senior housing bond money.


Although the SHA Commissioners have not yet decided which projects to recommend to the City Council for funding, an evaluation team has recommended three other proposals over the Indian Services Commission's proposal: a congregate care facility in Fremont for the mentally ill; a congregate care facility for frail elderly, to be developed by the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority, and a facility on Queen Anne for developmentally disabled adults.


Theresa Murphy, SHA public information officer, said there is only enough senior housing bond money available to fund two or three projects. Commissioners, she said, will hold a special meeting in two to three weeks to decide which projects to support. The City Council would make the final decision on funding following SHA's decision, Murphy added.


But Marshall said the Commission intends to develop the Leschi Center even if the Council does not approve funds to develop the senior housing.


""Several months ago, we didn't think we had the money to buy the site,"" he said. ""But we're in a slightly different position financially now. If the City Council doesn't approve our project, we would still buy the site, but hold off on the housing until we worked out another way to do it.""

The International Special Review District Board last week recommended that the City's Department of Licensing not renew the liquor license of King Chong Lung Grocery one of several businesses selling fortified wine in the International District.


The Review Board is trying to stem the sale of the wine to discourage the growing transient population and problems caused by their presence in the area.


The Board acted after the owner of King Chong Lung refused to voluntarily stop the sale of the fortified wine.


The Board must also decide later this year whether to recommend against renewal of the liquor licenses of three other District businesses which sell fortified wine; Golden Star Deli Market, the Palace Grocery and Gom Hong Company.


Although the Board wants to restrict the sale of fortified wine, businesses can still sell beer and other kinds of wine. But representatives of all four businesses facing possible loss of their liquor licenses expressed their opposition to the restriction at the Review Board's meeting last week. They said they will continue to sell the fortified wine.


The Board's decision, however, is only advisory. The Washington State Liquor Board makes all final decisions on renewal of liquor licenses.


""The concern of the business community is the impact of the sale of fortified wine on public health, safety and welfare,"" said Phil Fujii, Review Board coordinator.


The businesses selling the wine and members of the Review Board disagree over whether there is a correlation between the selling of the fortified wine and the increase in transient population and crime in the District.


""Some dangerous statements are being made,"" said Rodney Wong, attorney, representing King Chong Lung Grocery."" Statements like 'liquor is bad,' 'fortified wine causes crime,' or 'someone who looks dirty is a transient' does not explain or solve the problem.""


These stores are not very big and, unfortunately, depend on sales of fortified wine, Wong said.


Some of these businesses have been around for 20 to 30 years, so a little more weight should be given to those people, said Wong. ""I think the board's remedy is very harsh,"" he said. ""A denial of their license would really affect these people. They are going to be out of business without their liquor license.""


""I've supported the District for 35 years,"" Peter Wong, of King Chong Lung, told the Board. ""I'll lose my livelihood if I lose my license. We are not bad people ... you don't want to hurt us. We are good citizens. I have to have my license.


But Michio Teshima, director of the International District Housing Alliance, said, ""Most of the tenants in the ID don't go out at night because of the alcoholics.


""We feel a whole bunch of measures need to be looked at. If this continues, more businesses will be hurt. Residents I've talked to feel threatened by this trend.


""We are sensitive to the needs of these businesses. But maybe more emphasis should be placed on other food items at these businesses.""


If the State Liquor Board does not renew King Chong Lung's license, that decision could set a precedent for future renewal procedures, said Fujii. But he added that it is very rare that a liquor license is not renewed, unless the business has clearly broken the law.


""We'll have to watch out for the selling of the fortified wine to the obviously intoxicated people or the underaged,"" said Fujii. ""We are looking out for the greater good of the community and to make it more attractive to others who want to come down here. The economic vitality has to be maintained.""


Bill Ishii, president of the International District Economic Association, doesn't think the liquor licenses of businesses that sell fortified wine should be renewed.


""This affects more than these four families involved,"" he said. ""And we're not asking the denial of their livelihood.""


Michael Leong, an attorney in the District, also presented a petition to the Review Board with signatures of community people who oppose the sale of fortified wine in the District.


A representative from Gom Hong, a business that has been in the District for 30 years, said the store will not be able to survive without the liquor license.


""We have a license because we want to sell our own wine and beer,"" she said. ""We have the right to do that. Our main business is the fortified wine. If we can't sell it, our income will be reduced.""


A representative of the Mayor's Task Force on Street People, Tom Scott, said a bill has been submitted to the Washington State Legislature to limit the sale of fortified wine and possibly restrict it to speciality shops.


But, still, there's disagreement over whether there is a relationship between the fortified wine and transients and crime.


""The question is, Are the licenses really the causing the transients to come to the District?"" said Rodney Wong. ""There are no real facts to prove that. I think these stores are being singled out, being used a scapegoats.""


""Alcoholics are a deterrent to the area,"" said Mark Jones of the International District Preservation and Development Authority and a Review Board member. I'd feel negligent if I didn't vote for some kind of contract or denial. But this is not the only means of stopping the problem.""


King Chong Lung is now appealing the Review Board's decision to the State Liquor Board, in hopes of keeping its license. The Liquor Board has about three months to make its decision.


Each business will be asked to agree not to sell fortified wine when their license renewal comes up, said Fujii. And all new liquor license applicants to the board will have to sign an agreement not to sell fortified wine.


""This is hard on the board,"" said Irene Woo, a Review Board member. ""Policy must be set and the curbing of selling fortified wine must be done to limit the transient population.


""This is a city-wide problem. We don't want to play a negative role. But we have to consider what are we going to do with the transients.""

HONG KONG -- The death of the governor of Hong Kong, Sir Edward Youde, was announced here last week. Sir Edward died in his sleep in Beijing, where he was visiting to open an office of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and to hold talks with senior Chinese officials.


Messages of condolence have been arriving in Hong Kong from around the world, including the Foreign Ministers of China and Britain. The news of Sir Edward's death was met with shock throughout Hong Kong. Flags are being flown at half-mast, and trading on the Hong Kong stock market was suspended on Dec. 5 as a mark of respect.


Sir Edward, who was 62 years old, became governor of Hong Kong in 1982. He played a leading role in the Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's future, and since the conclusion of the agreement on the territory's future in 1984 had worked tirelessly to promote it.


He had a long and distinguished career in the British Foreign Service, which he joined in 1947. Prior to becoming governor, Sir Edward had served in China three times, finally as Ambassador from 1974 to 1978.


Sir Edward last visited the United States in July this year, giving addresses in San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago. During his diplomatic career he served twice in the United States, first in Washington from 1956 to 1960, then in the United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations from 1965 to 1969.


Sir Edward's duties will be taken over by Hong Kong's Chief Secretary, Sir David Akers-Jones.

Actor Richard ""Curly"" Lee-Sung was one of the few fortunate Asian Pacific actors to get a job this year. It was in the feature ""Firewalker"" produced by Cannon Films. But the unfortunate aspect is the character he played was called ""The Chinaman.""


Curly is one of the braver Asian Pacific actors. He had the guts to complain to the powers that be that the character's name is racist and derogatory. Making the complaint might not seem like such a big deal to people outside show business, but Curly's speaking out could brand him a trouble-maker in the industry, which could lead to his being black-listed.


A recent example of putting careers at risk occurred on a shoot about California Indians. The actors noticed that tepees were part of the set, and they told the director that the Indians they were portraying did not live in tepees. When the actors returned from lunch, they were fired. The performers were paid their contractual salary so they had no recourse.


Curly's agent also risked his position in the industry when he went to bat and registered to the casting director his dissatisfaction with the character name. After some discussion with the production company and the suggestion of a new name by the agent, the character was listed on Curly's contract as ""The Chinaman (General Fayloy)."" When the film was released recently, Curly's character in the cast listing was ""The Chinaman.""


On Nov. 20, 1986, the agent wrote to executive producers Norman Aladjem and Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum to register a formal complaint about the cast listing, stating, ""We are concerned with the insensitivity of the production. In this present time the community is sensitive to any reference that has racial/derogatory connotations. I am certain you must be aware the black community does take offense to be referred to as 'Nigger.' The word 'Chinaman' does invoke the same emotions in Chinese people."" No reply has been received from the executive producers.


Television viewers may have noticed how often the work ""Jap"" was used in the recent CBS movie ""Women of Valor."" True, the story depicted an era when the appellation was common, but one would think the network's broadcast standards and practices personnel should be aware that the word is insulting to the many Pacific Asians in the audience and the more sensitive viewers outside the community.


There are several reasons why an actor will accept a role which is demeaning. Some actors, like Curly, will take the role and then try to convince the producers to alter it. Others will take the role because the opportunities to work are so few, or they are desperate and need the money or might have to work a day or two in order to qualify for pension and health benefits. Some are pressured by their agents or personal managers to take the job in order to enhance or preserve their careers.


Some Asian Pacifics believe actors should not take a stereotypical or demeaning role if they will not speak out to change the character. The acting profession is not like that of accountants, pharmacists, teachers or physicians. Unlike the others, a degree or a certain amount of experience on a resume does not qualify an actor for work. Management (the producers, director or casting directors) takes into account the actors' TVQ, television quotient via audience survey; market or box office value, physical appearance and personality. The evaluation is not necessarily objective, and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges don't apply because of the employer's First Amendment rights.


The show business community is very tight, and it doesn't take much to get black-listed. It happened in the '50s, and it was almost impossible to prove it. The same holds true today. A producer can say actors weren't hired because they were too short, too tall, too pretty, too ugly, too bubbly, too reserved, the chemistry wasn't right, or the actor didn't audition as well as the performer hired. If none of the those reasons were true, it would be nearly impossible to prove it in court.


Some actors who have a sense of social responsibility or are financially secure or aren't desperate for health benefits or fighting near extinction, can either refuse the role or they may take the job and risk their reputation and career and try to change the character as written. There are some who fall into this category, Clyde Kusatsu, Nobu McCarthy, Ernest Harada, Pat Li and Peter Kwong, among others. They have been willing to refuse a role or speak out if they accept it, knowing they could be fired and there would be a dozen actors in the wings willing to take the part. In the non-acting world their intestinal fortitude would be tantamount to insulting the CEO in front of the corporate board of directors and the press.


The community should salute those in entertainment industry who dare display their integrity and loyalty to the Pacific Asian community while risking the chance of ever earning another dollar in their chosen profession.

""Lotus Blossom Doesn't Live Here Anymore.""


This slogan was a theme during the formation of the Asian-Pacific Women's Caucus back in 1976. The theme is still relevant today.


""Asian women still have to struggle with the stereotype, formed by the majority culture, of being obedient and passive,"" states Sutapa Basu, current co-chair of the Caucus.


The Caucus was formed by a group of Asian community activists who saw the need for a statewide women's network to protect their interests and address issues affecting Asian women and the Asian community.


The Caucus, which has approximately 75 members, is co-chaired by Basu and Mary Hsu. Other officers are Elaine Ikoma Ko, secretary, and Joanne Asaba, treasurer.


""The Caucus is very issue-oriented,"" states Basu. The group has promoted affirmative action by supporting those fighting race and sex discrimination in the workplace. Last May, the Caucus also held a reception honoring Asian-Pacific women recently appointed to state and county government positions.


Basu stresses that the Caucus operates at a grassroots level, addressing all types of social problems and providing a voice for community concerns.


""It's a way for Asian women to get together and solve problems,"" she said.


The Caucus doesn't just serve ""professional"" women. Initially, Caucus concerns were community-oriented. Later, career issues were emphasized. Now the Caucus is addressing both needs.


""We're starting to balance out now,"" says Ticiang Diangson, member of the Caucus issues committee. Diangson publicly protested apartheid in South Africa by marching outside the South African Consul's home in Seattle two years ago. She has recently been the Caucus representative during meetings between Seattle Public Schools Superintendent William Kendrick and the Asian community.


""I'm still not clear whether Kendrick sees the Asian community as being diverse,"" says Diangson.


The Caucus offers job skills training workshops and has worked with the Refugee Employment Network, which helps Southeast Asian women find jobs.


The Caucus and the North Seattle Community College Women's Program, where Basu is director, will co-sponsor a series of workshops, approximately one every two months. The first workshop, held October 14, addressed the effects of the new tax law on Asian-Pacific women. Future workshops will focus on such topics as stress and time management, education, job skills and health care.


The Caucus will also hold a ""Women Warrior"" awards dinner November 21 at the House of Hong Restaurant. The event will honor Asian-Pacific women in the areas of art, business, community service, education, government, media, mentor and politics.


""We're trying to broaden and diversify (the awards) and recognize the average, behind-the-scenes people -- people who may not necessarily get recognition,"" says Elaine Ikoma Ko. For more information on the ""Women Warrior"" dinner, contact Ko at 322-4467 or Basu at 527-3696.


The Caucus will soon produce a newsletter, and Basu encourages Asian-Pacific women to contact her to submit articles.


With the growing Asian-Pacific population, especially Southeast Asians, Basu sees the need to reach out and respond to different needs.


""We're very flexible,"" she said. ""We can design our program according to the needs of the population.""


If you would like more information on the Asian-Pacific Women's Caucus, contact Sutapa Basu at 527-3696.

(Editor's note: Following is the text of a July 2, 1986 letter, a copy of which was obtained by Asian Week, from an attorney for former United Bank shareholders in regard to negotiations for a settlement of the shareholders' claims against United Bank and KMG Main Hurdman, the accounting firm which audited United's books.)


Dear Bob:


I apologize for my delay in following up on my letter to Percy Duran dated February 21, 1986. It has taken some time to compile the list of shareholder claims and supporting information related thereto we mentioned in that letter. We are addressing this letter to you in view of the fact that Percy is no longer employed by United Bank.


In our February 21, 1986 letter, we confirmed that in our conversations with you and Percy you indicated that United Bank and Main Hurdman are interested in further discussions concerning settlement of the claims of the United Bank shareholders whom we represent. Those claims are founded upon the fact that United Bank's audited financial statements for December 31, 1984 as well as for 1982 and 1983 were materially false and misleading, and upon the findings and actions of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board with respect to Main Hurdman and United Bank. As we have previously stated, it is also clear to us that the unaudited financial statements for each of the three quarters of 1985 were also materially false and misleading. There were also personal contacts and meetings during which false and misleading information concerning United Bank was disseminated particularly a meeting at United Bank on November 13, 1984 attended by Maurice Weiss. We have previously described to you the full nature of the claims of our shareholder clients against United Bank and Main Hurdman in our initial letter to you and Percy Duran dated December 24, 1985.


We have enclosed for your review a complete compilation of shareholder information, including the names of the shareholders, the amount, date and purchase price of their stock, as well as the amount of proceeds from any subsequent sale thereof and the amount of now worthless stock still held by them. As you can see, some of the shareholders sold all or some of their stock at a severe loss, while the vast majority did not or were unable to sell any stock and thus suffered a total loss of their investment. The last column represents the claims of the individual shareholders whose stock is now worthless. Those claims total $2,017,346.00.


While we hope to avoid needless litigation over the failure of United Bank by engaging in good faith settlement negotiations for the purpose of accomplishing our clients' objectives and minimizing the damages of the offices and directors and main Hurdman, our clients certainly intend to vigorously pursue their judicial remedies should these settlement negotiations fail to bear fruit. We urge you to give strong and appropriate consideration to confidentially settling the claims of this limited number of shareholders and the potentially disastrous consequences of a drawn-out bitter public litigation which is likely to lead to lawsuits being filed by other shareholders against Main Hurdman and United Bank.


I suggest that, upon your receipt of this letter and after due consultation with your client, we set up another meeting with yourself and representatives of Main Hurdman to further discuss settlement of the shareholder claims. While we understand that there has been a delay in forwarding this information to you, we are quite anxious to resolve these matters and wish to hear from you within ten days.


Very truly yours,


Stanley W. Levy

LOWELL, Mass. -- Computer magnate An Wang caught the ears and eyes of the national business community when he recently took over management of his Wang Laboratories, and the future of the $2.4 billion company is questionable in the opinion of some experts.


We informed company vice-president J. Carl Masi that the sales and marketing divisions would henceforth report directly to Wang himself, prompting Masi to submit his resignation in April.


While many Wang emloyees are hopeful that with ""The Doctor"" back in charge the old magic of Wang's early days will return, industry observers fear the 65-year-old immigrant may have bit off more than he can chew for himself and his 35-year-old son, Frederick; who is being groomed to take over the company.


""Wang and his son understand technology but they lack skills critical to sales and management,"" Business Week magazine warned. ""If Frederick Wang wants the top job, he'll have to overcome the alienation of many staffers. Says a former sales manager: ""He's a very bright guy in mathematics but doesn't work very well with people.""


Wang is pulling out of a big slump. In January the company landed a $480 million contract with the U.S. Air Force to produce a computerized workstation. It beat out IBM for the contract.


Wang Labs suffered when IBM released its personal computer on the market. Though Wang has tried valiantly to compete, Business Week noted that ""many customers still look to Wang for word processing expertise -- but rely on companies such as IBM and DEC for sophisticated office systems.""


Wang's office system is still riddled with numerous software bugs,"" the magazine noted.

SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett praised Asian American parents for their children's collective achievement in school, during a visit to Chinatown Wednesday.


Bennett also reaffirmed his support for bilingual education but said he does not want the federal government to force local school districts to adopt a uniform system for bilingual students.


Bennett's visit was arranged as part of First Lady Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign.


Asian Week publisher John T.C. Fang presented Bennett with a Chinese translation of a booklet recently published by the Education Dept., ""Schools Without Drugs."" Translation, typesetting and printing of the booklet were donated by Asian Week and Chinese TV Guide.


Bennett said it was essential that parents develop firm discipline among their school age children.


""This book suggests ways to help children just say no to drugs. But first and foremost is parents. Those children who have been raised carefully by their mothers and fathers have the best chance of avoiding drugs. As in all areas of education, parents are the most important teachers,"" Bennett said at a luncheon at the Grand Palace.


Bennett told Asian Week he had high praise for Asian American parents for their success with their children.


""The results are clear -- Asian American students are doing very well. Their parents set high expectations, demand results and make them work hard,"" Bennett said.


Bennett said he had heard ""rumors"" of unofficial quotas imposed on Asian American enrollment at the University of California and various Ivy League schools, but had received no hard data nor any official complaints. He said that if any valid complaint of such discrimination was brought to his department, it would investigate and prosecute if necessary.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The new chairman of the Mexican American Political Association here said he hopes to help forge an era of greater cooperation between Hispanics and Asian Americans.


Roger Cardenas, 42, was elevated to the chairmanship of the S. F. chapter of MAPA when former Chairman Mike Garza stepped down to run against Congresswoman Sala Burton in this November's election.


Cardenas, who is a member and former vice chairman of the S.F. Committee on Elections, claims the 26-year-old MAPA represents about 28,000 registered Latino voters and their families in San Francisco.


Though Asian Americans account for an estimated 1/4 of the total population of The City, they only make up about 6 percent of the registered voters, according to political experts.


Cardenas said both groups could exert greater influence if they joined together on issues of mutual concern.


Though the MAPA chapter has not officially made any endorsements yet for the November election, Cardenas said he personally expects many members will assist in Secretary of State March Fong Eu's reelection campaign.


""Another issue is representation on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Neither of our communities has one of its members on the board, and I think this is something we can work on together,"" Cardenas said in an interview.


Cardenas said the MAPA board will interview both Thomas Hsieh and Dr. Willie Gee to consider whether to give the 2 Chinese American supervisorial candidates support in November. He added that, though he is encouraging MAPA members to search for a viable Hispanic candidate for Supervisor, he does not expect a Latino to run this year.


The confirmation of state Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso stands out as 1 of the most crucial election issues for local Hispanics this year, Cardenas said. MAPA will take no position until at least August on the more controversial confirmation vote on Chief Justice Rose Bird.


Local housing and planning issues are concerns on which Asians and Latinos can work together, Cardenas suggested. He said speculation has inflated housing costs to the point that a house in the Mission District that was selling for $100,000 4 years ago can now go for as high as $400,000. The speculation in the neighborhoods is a spillover from the lack of clear direction on the downtown highrise situation, he maintained.

TAIPEI -- Air pollution and smoking have made lung cancer the most deadly form of cancer in Taiwan, according to the National Health Administration of the Executive Yuan.


The annual number of lung cancer deaths spiraled 3000 percent between 1932 and 1981 and reached a total of 702 in 1983, the Taiwan Veterans General Hospital said in a report.


Health officials blame motor vehicles, particularly motorbikes which crowd the streets of Taiwan's cities, together with smoking, for the increase in the incidence of the illness.


The percentage of women who smoke has actually declined in the past 21 years, from 4.63 percent in 1963 down to 4.59 percent in 1973 and 3.29 percent in 1984. But population expansion has more than made up for this percentage change.


Studies also indicate that smoking mothers give birth to sicker babies. Their children have twice the incidence of bronchitis and suffer physical and mental disabilities.


Smoking during pregnancy often causes premature delivery and underweight infants. But people keep smoking.

The preservation and development of the Chinatown-International District as a strong residential and commercial neighborhood is an important City goal.


Over the last 10 years, the City established the area as a Special Review District to help preserve and protect its character, created the Seattle Chinatown I.D. Preservation and Development Authority to help develop the District, and provided millions of dollars to upgrade the area.


In addition, the Department of Community Development staffed the Special Review District Board and assisted in the renovation of buildings and helped businesses.


By leveraging funds and cooperatively working with the community, the area has greatly improved. Housing units have been built, buildings have been upgraded and new businesses have emerged.


Last year, the Special Review District development guidelines were changed to encourage greater development. More uses and greater density are now allowed in the District's core, and incentives for residential development on the hillside have been added. Potential improvements to the Union Station and its corridor, completion of 1-90, and new businesses at 12th and South Jackson should also help the area's development.


With the basic ingredients for neighborhood growth in place, the area is poised for further development. The Department of Community Development has played an important role in upgrading the area and will continue to do so with the cooperation of the community.


The financial resources available to the City, however, have substantially diminished. The City does not have the financial resources it did in the past for residential and commercial projects or social services.


Despite the limited resources, the Department remains committed to helping the area realize its goals as stated in the Special Review District regulations.


The Department of Community Development proposes to undertake a new work plan in the District. The draft work plan is primarily targeted toward development, but it covers a broad range of issues that concern the District. The plan will further housing development, promote business, improve public safety and neighborhood improvement.


The plan will be carried out by a Development Team consisting of Doug Chin, Phil Fujii and Junko Whitaker.


A key element of the work plan is the formation of an advisory group which will work in partnership with the Department to help establish and carry out goals and strategies for the District on such issues as housing, business expansion, transportation and parking and neighborhood improvement.


The International District Advisory Group will be a balanced group representative of the major interests of the community. The Department is seeking 10 persons who are either District business owners or agents, property owners, residents or members of established community organizations.


If you are interested in applying to serve on the Advisory Group, call Doug Chin at 625-4773.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Asians make up only a tiny portion of the clients at The City's drug abuse clinic.


The Department of Health Substance Abuse program, which provides counseling, abstinance programs, medical intervention and health education, served only 123 Asians out of 8168 drug abusers and 400 Asians out of 8034 alcohol abusers in its 1985-86 year.


Asians thus made up only 2 percent of the drug abusers and 5 percent of the alcohol abusers, although they account for nearly a quarter of The City's population.


In a report on its plans and budget, the program cited studies suggesting that the biggest drinking problem for Asians is conflict with spouses. Compared to other groups they had a low incidence of ""nigh intake.""


Other studies have shown that Asians tend to seek counseling for psychological problems at a lower rate in general than the rest of the population.

No Small Abbrev.


Amy Chihara of Highland, Indiana received high praise from Congressman Norman Y. Mineta for her efforts to get the Chicago Tribune to halt its practice of using the abbreviation ""Jap."" for Japan or Japanese.


""Ms. Chihara has provided an excellent model for all of us to follow. She has shown us how to be persistent and to fight racism in all its manifestations, no matter how small or petty it may appear to some,"" said Mineta.


Both Chihara and Mineta had sent letters to the Tribune to reconsider its style. Chicago Tribune Media Services Vice President Michael Argirion responded to Chihara. ""I have conveyed the concern over the use of the abbreviation Jap. for Japan/Japanese to our Crossword Puzzle Editor. You can be sure that we will be more sensitive in future issues.""


Mineta has cosponsored a House resolution to encourage the use of the abbreviation ""Jpn."" in place of ""Jap."" which recently passed.


In his letter to the Tribune, Mineta wrote: ""To Americans of Japanese ancestry, the word 'Jap' is the worst racial slur possible. Though my concern about a simple word game may appear petty, the casual use of racist and derogatory terms have no place anywhere in the mass media.""

Where are the Industrial Laser Process Technicians of tomorrow?


If the present trend continues, they are not among the urban poor. They're at home in suburbia doing their homework on a PC. Unfortunately, inner-city youth don't have the same access to technological literacy afforded suburban youth. Consequently, the children of these low-income minorities who have been excluded from full participation in today's workplace face a bleak legacy.


Few have access to computers, and even fewer have them at home. And while many of tomorrow's high-tech jobs, such as electronic assembler, will be low-paying, there are a few emerging occupations which will pay a decent wage and will not require a college degree.


An Industrial Laser Process Technician, by the way, services and maintains equipment using laser beam technology. The occupational title may never replace ""truck driver"" as a household term, but it will be in demand.


Industrial Robot Production Technicians and Genetic Engineering Technicians will be in demand, too. And there are many more: Energy Technicians, Housing Rehabilitation Technicians, Materials Utilization Technicians, Hazardous Waste Management Technicians -- a dozen or more emerging occupations which will provide a decent livelihood.


These jobs are expected to be hot by the year 2000, and minority youth should be preparing for them now. Although none will require a college education, they will require computer literacy; and unless we address this issue now, the job and income gap between minorities and whites may widen in the next 10 to 15 years.


While schools in suburban and other higher income area are providing every child with access to a computer, most urban and central city schools don't provide the same resources, at least to the same degree. While many middle and upper income families are raising their children on PCs, low income families still can't afford a hand calculator for their children. If inequities persist in the way we prepare our children for the era of workplace automation, the economic condition for minorities may not be improved from what it is today.


Education, employment and training administrators at the local, state and national levels need to devise programs and policies that will break this vicious cycle. Otherwise, the systematic injustices in terms of how we educate our young people will perpetuate the plight of minorities for another generation.


The role of education and training at all levels, including adult education, must be to make students technologically literate if they are to survive in tomorrow's society. At Employment Security, we take this role seriously; and I would urge all parents -- particularly those in the minority communities -- to participate in the technological education of our children.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A powerful conglomerate from the Far East gained a foothold in the Asian American community of California last week when . . . Corporation took over financially troubled United Bank.


Hibernia is owned by First Pacific Holdings. Ltd. of Hong Kong, which in turn is controlled by a group of Indonesian investors known as Liem Investors. First Pacific Holdings acquired Hibernia in 1982 at a time that Hibernia Bank was also in financial trouble. Hibernia Bancshares last year reported a profit in excess of $8 million.


United Bank's name will be changed to United Savings Bank, and stock from the older institution will not be transferrable to the new bank. All deposits will be honored by the new bank.


James Ng has been appointed the president and chief executive officer of United Savings Bank. Ng has spent 14 years with Chase Manhattan Bank handling various aspects of that bank's business in Hong Kong.


Ben Hom, former chairman and president of United, will remain with the new institution as an advisor but will hold no executive authority, Ng said.


Sau-Wing Lam was named chief administrative officer of the bank. Lam was most recently a vice president of Hibernia Bank, where he headed up the Trust Department. Prior to that he was a vice president of Crocker Bank.


Senior officials of the bank and its parent company all stressed that United's attraction was its solid presence in the Asian American Community throughout the state. The bank has 26 branches in the Bay Area, Sacramento, Stockton and Southern California, and was formerly hailed as the largest minority-owned financial institution in the country.


United reported substantial losses last year due to real estate development deals which went sour. The losses fueled rumors in the Chinese community and sparked a run on the branches in Chinese neighborhoods. Millions of dollars were withdrawn within a few days.


Ng said at a press conference last Friday that he has no immediate plans for closing any of United's branches.


""We will study the situations at all the branches carefully to see what changes if any need to be made. We will probably keep all the branches open,"" Ng said.


Officials of First Pacific Holdings said they have no plans for merging Hibernia Bank with United. The two serve distinct and separate markets, they said.


Hibernia will infuse approximately $15 million into United, on top of $43.9 million in financial assistance being offered by the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation.


United has assets of $600 million and deposits of nearly $500 million.


Hibernia Bank was founded in 1859 and is said to be the oldest state-chartered bank in California.

The Asian Business League recently launched a program to help out students at The City's George Washington High School, which has a large Asian American student population. ABL is lining up monthly speakers to not only serve as role models for the young people but also give them practical tips on how to become successful in their chosen fields. ABL's Ben Cardenas, purchasing manager at the exclusive Campton Place hotel, recently gave the first talk to the youngsters and got into a lively discussion with one young man who wants to be a chef and a restaurant owner when he grows up.


One student we've heard about has already accomplished something most of his mentors are still dreaming about. Patrick Y. Chan has been selected to appear in the new edition of Who's Who In California. Chan is the president of the Asian Business Association at San Francisco State University, and was selected by the Who's Who Historical Society for having ""demonstrated outstanding professional achievement, superior leadership and exceptional service.""


Among the other 6000 people whose biographical sketches appear in the volume, he will be joining the likes of Long Beach's Esther Chan, Redwood City's Florence Chan, Orange's Grace Chan, Bakersfield's Lu-Choi Chan, Berkeley's Margaret Chan, San Jose's Paul K. Chan, San Lorenzo's Raymond K. Chan (not to be confused with La Jolla's Raymond Y.F. Chan), Oakland's Ronald A. Chan, Long Beach's Samuel Chan, etc.

SAN FRANCISCO--Dr. William Gee's candidacy for the Board of Supervisors started rolling this week with the hiring of a new campaign manager and the laying of plans to run a serious high-visibility campaign.


Gee told his listeners that he needed to raise another $40,000 on top of the $30,000 he has on hand to have any chance of unseating an incumbent.


Gee met with leaders of Chinatown's ""establishment"" organizations Wednesday to introduce dane Manpin as his campaign manager and to discuss strategy.


Gee's campaign had previously been overshadowed by Tom Hsieh's well-financed effort to win a seat on the board in the November election. Hsieh's appointment to the board last week, however, changed the complexion of Gee's campaign completely.


The Chinese community's resources might still be split. Community College Board member Julie Tang last Friday filed papers to run for the board also.


But concern about Tang's candidacy was not evident at Wednesday's meeting.


""The clearest difference between Dr. Gee and the other candidates is his long-standing - reputation for honesty and intergrity, and that will be one of the central themes of our campaign,"" Manpin said.


""We want to run a highly visible campaign with bus signs, mass mailings and advertising in the local newspapers. If we have enough money, we would also like to go on the radio,"" Manpin said.


Gee stressed that he did not want to raise the $40,000 all in Chinatown but rather plans a series of fundraising events throughout The City.


Leaders of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association attended the meeting and pledged their support.


George Leong Suey, former national director of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, em phasized the need to take the campaign to non-Chinese voters.


""We probably won't even have to put up a single sign in Chinatown because everyone here already knows and supports Dr. Gee. But he is not well known out along 19th Avenue in the Sunset district or in other neighborhoods (on the southern side of town), and that is where we have to concentrate the campaign,"" Suey said.

Unless you're a millionaire, you might have trouble writing a $50,000 donation check to your favorite charity.


But you can guarantee your charity that amount (or more) and receive appropriate tax benefits at the same time -- all for the relatively small annual cost of a life insurance premium.


Contributing life insurance benefits is a popular method of charitable giving for several reasons. It is a way to make a large charitable gift without affecting assets earmarked for family members or influencing family business interests or current investments. And unlike securities, which can decrease in value, life insurance benefits are fixed and guaranteed -- even if the donor dies after paying only one premium.


In addition, as long as the donor lives, the policy's cash value grows. The longer the donor lives, the larger the cash value accumulation available to the charity. Plus, even if the insured person becomes disabled, charity benefits will not change if the plan contains a waiver-of-premium benefit.


When the insured donor dies, the charity promptly receives the full policy benefit, tax-free, in cash. There are no probate and administrative costs or court delays that might occur if a gift is given through a will. Heirs cannot contest the gift because the policy is a contract; and because insurance proceeds are not part of the probate estate, a donor may avoid the unwanted publicity that often surrounds a large gift.


For the donor, a contribution of life insurance benefits can yield either income or estate tax benefits. If you, as donor, retain ownership and control of the policy and name your favorite charity as beneficiary, policy proceeds can be deducted from your estate taxes.


On the other hand, if you give the policy to a charity and pay the premiums, these premiums are deductible on your current income tax return. You can retain policy ownership, such as the power to change the beneficiary or to obtain cash value. But if you do, this eliminates your income tax deduction of the premium because it represents an incomplete gift of less than your entire interest in the property.


There are other ways to support a favorite charity through life insurance that offers substantial tax benefits.


For example, an employee may name a charity as beneficiary of group term coverage over $50,000 and avoid paying tax on the benefit. Currently, employees must include cost of group term life insurance coverage over $50,000 in their taxable income, and the tax on the economic benefit must be paid in after-tax dollars.


In addition, an individual who cannot afford to donate complete policy benefits can give annual policy dividends to charity. The donor can specify the number of years the contribution would continue. The contribution could be established on an unlimited basis, but the donor must also reserve the right to revoke the program at any time. Dividends are tax-deductible as they are paid.


Also, a donor could use policy dividends to purchase a new policy and give ownership of the new policy to charity. The charitable contribution here would be equal to the premium paid.


In order to use life insurance as a means for charitable giving, you must have established a logical relationship with the charitable organization by making previous contributions or showing other indication of interest or support. And before you take steps to establish a charitable giving program, you should consult your financial planner and attorney.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A Chinese American developer here said The City has the chance to link thousands of small businesses with trading partners throughout the Pacific Rim.


Shih-tso ""Joe"" Chen, president of Rede Investment which is building the three-phase Pacific Center on Fourth Street between Market and Mission, said he wants to open up Pacific trade for small and minority-owned businesses which ""make up the backbone of San Francisco's economy.""


Asian entrepreneurs make up a hefty percentage of the small business owners here and account for about 60 percent of Chen's tenants in the first two phases of the center, known as the Apparel Mart because of the dominance of textile manufacturers and distributors among its tenants.


The third phase of the $120 million development recently got the go-ahead from the Planning Department, which had considered revoking the permit because construction had not begun on schedule. Chen successfully argued that Rede had already spent $5 million on laying the foundation for the third phase of the center and construction is scheduled for completion in late 1989.


In an Aug. 20 letter to Chen, Zoning Administrator Robert Passmore said that ""the Pacific III project is under construction within the meaning and intent of Planning Code Section 175.1 and the related Zoning Bulletin dated Feb. 21, 1986,"" according to a press release issued by Chen.


Sue Hestor, counsel for San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth, filed an appeal of the department's ruling, which will be heard by the Board of Permit Appeals on Wednesday, Sept. 24.


According to a report in the S.F. Business Times, Hestor charges that Rede has altered the original intent of the center, putting in offices instead of apparel marketing space. She also complains that Rede has not built a promised underground connection to BART and has not contributed money promised to The City's affordable housing fund.


Chen in an interview with Asian Week expressed confidence that the Board of Permit Appeals would reject Hestor's appeal.


Chen envisions tremendous potential for Asian American small business owners after the project is completed.


""The apparel business is closely linked to the Pacific Rim. Our tenants are involved in that trade, and we feel this is very important for The City because no other facility in San Francisco fills this purpose,"" Chen said.


""The Pacific Center is not like a downtown office building. We have approximately 350 showrooms, and for the most part our tenants are small businesses, the backbone of San Francisco's economy,"" Chen said.


The center hosts seasonal promotional exhibits of clothing that attract up to 800 buyers from retailers in southern Oregon, Nevada and parts of Idaho as well as Northern California, Chen said.


Chen served on the Mayor's Economic Development Council from 1979 to 1981 and now chairs her Chinese Investment Task Force.


He said as The City's small businesses take on a greater role in trade across the Pacific, the local Asian American community will be called upon to help bridge the gap between cultures.


""Asian Americans are a significant population group in San Francisco, and will have a major impact on the social scene. This city will continue to become more attractive to Asian business people from overseas.""


Rede Investment is also the principal developer of Franklin Square Industrial Center condominium project, on which construction recently began. That $10 million complex is also geared specifically to small businesses. (See Asian Week, 7/18/86.)


When ground was broken for the Franklin Square project, Chen announced that 60 percent of the light industrial space in the complex had already been reserved for small businesses including garment manufacturers, printers, food processors, importers-exporters and the like.


Chen said merchants throughout the world are attracted to San Francisco because ""this is one of the most wide open places in the world. You can achieve success here with hard work, integrity and reliability -- these are traits that get you places in San Francisco.""


He said that although there is still the danger of discrimination, he does not see any signs of overt racism at higher levels of the business community. ""If there was, I would never have gotten to where I am. I had no business background -- I just came on my own steam.""


Chen said the future of The City is threatened by measures such as Proposition M. on the city ballot in November, which would limit construction and growth.


""It could take years for San Francisco to recover if Proposition M is passed. The voters have to decide if they want The City to become just a tourist center or a great place to live and work,"" Chen said.

Our ""Voices"" column may have been a bit too gung-ho on the new ABC television series, ""Gung Ho."" In August we printed Sab Shimono's paean to his series (unreleased at the time); and then Shimono's manager Henry Ong wrote last week's column encouraging Asian Americans to write letters of support for the series to ABC entertainment president Brandon Stoddard. After seeing the premiere episode of the series Friday night, all I can say is, hold those letters of support, because ""Gung Ho"" is godawful.


The series is based on Ron Howard's movie about comical conflicts between Japanese management and American workers at a newly revived auto plant in Pittsburgh trying to find some common ground. From what I saw Friday night, producer George Sunga, his actors and writers have created a sitcom nightmare of high-strung, nerdish Asians versus blue collar Americans who come across as more (although not much more) human, heroic and intelligent that the bumbling foreigners.


The chief idiot is the manager Kaz, played by Gedde Watanabe, who deals clumsily with his unruly white workers (led by Scott Bakula), his rigidly traditional second-in-command Saito (Sab Shimono), and his wife Umeki (Patti Yasutake) and son Kenji (Scott Atari).


The show's producers may argue that Kaz is a person with good points and bad points, strengths and weaknesses, as we all have of course, but the character is a comic 'book anachronism: another neurotic, hysterical Japanese schmuck, like the landlord Mickey Rooney played in the film ""Breakfast, at Tiffany's"" in the 1950s.


""Gung Ho"" emphasizes more stereotypes for laughs: Shimono's character, for example, is so rigid and stern that he's ultimately unbelievable. Haven't we seen enough of these brittle 'Japanese types in guest shots on other sitcoms? The problem here is that this stuffed shirt, Saito, is a regular character, and he's made to have comic book responses, like Kaz.


Saito also utters rapid statements that enforce narrow impressions of Asian culture, e.g., in Japan, he generalizes, young people who fail in college kill themselves -- ""that's what I want for my children (in America),"" says Saito, We're also asked to laugh at Saito's relationship with his very submissive, kimono-clad wife. Perhaps to some extent, this imbalance still goes on in Japanese culture, but in the way it's portrayed on ""Gung Ho,"" with actress Emily Kuroda made to do everything that I thought died out with Miyoshi Umeki, it's simply embarrassing.


The remainder of the attempts at comedy rest on screwball. There's a scene where Kaz goes to a working class bar that his American employees hang out at in order to placate them for firing one of the plant's welders. The television on a perch above the bar is on the blink. ""Television Japanese,"" says Kaz, ""all it needs is a good whack,"" and he whacks it, idiotically; and the t.v. crashes to the floor. Is this supposed to be hilarious?


The bar is also the place where Kaz, with mock-machismo, confronts his disgruntled, workers another time and asks, ""Who can I fight with?,"" after which the bartender throws him a baseball bat. Not much to laugh about when one thinks of Vincent Chin's murder by baseball bat by unemployed auto workers in Detroit. (The writers of this series, all non-Asian, could have been oblivious to the parallel; the Asian American actors, who boast steadily in the show's p.r. about injecting a strong and responsible Asian and Asian American consciousness to their roles and the show's direction, should not have been.)


Lastly, the bar is the setting of the closing conciliatory scene where Kaz and the workers cap their compromise by heading off to a communal night dip at a nearby river -- this derives from Kaz's insistence that his workers take part in daily morning communal baths, as is done apparently in Japan, to increase worker harmony and productivity. One of the workers cajoles Kaz to join them, and Kaz eventually says ""What the hell,"" leaps up, and says ""Bonzai!"" The camera freezes on him in mid-air, which was one of co-producer Ron Howard's favorite technical sign-offs in his ""Happy Days"" series. I also recall, languidly, that Pat Morita had to exclaim a ""Bonzai!"" or two on the same series.


""Gung Ho"" might improve considerably with a revamp of priorities -- more balanced action between factions; more modulated, normal Asian characters; less emphasis on the easy laugh, particularly on the basis of cultural delusions. Unfortunately, I doubt that the show's next five episodes (remember, it's on a tryout run) will be much better than the first, since the first has established the basic characters and laid out the basic situation, and it all looks rather weak to me.


The writing, even without cultural inferences, is shallow. When Kaz angrily lifts up his son, who has reported to his father that he cheated on a school exam, Kaz's wife begs, ""Put boy down. No one in family should dangle."" This has to be sitcom writing at its worst.


Obviously, I don't buy the argument that ""Gung Ho"" is a breakthrough series because of its relatively large Asian cast, and should therefore be supported enthusiastically.


It's ridiculous for us to support shows on national networks merely because they feature Asian American actors. I'm sad to say that ""Gung Ho"" does not deserve an audience, Asian American or not. I'm looking forward to a time when the industry (and I'm talking to Asian American actors, writers, directors, producers and managers as well) will stop pushing the kind of inanity promoted in a series like ""Gung Ho."" Producer George Sunga should be ashamed of himself.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Hundreds of Asian Americans will soon hit the streets with picket signs in hand, if the fears of the hotel workers' union local are born out.


""If it comes to the point where the union has to strike the major hotels to win decent wages, benefits and working conditions, it will be the Asian employees and the Asian community who will play a decisive role,"" said Sherri Chiesa, President of Local 2 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union.


Asians, particularly Chinese and Filipinos, make up an estimated 30 percent of the union's 7,000 employees. And in the view of some, these employees make up the back-bone of the union, since they occupy as much as 50 percent of the ""back of the house"" jobs--such as dishwashers who receive about $5 and maids who receive about $7.58 per hour with no tips.


People with these jobs tend to turn out in higher numbers at union rallies and other activities, according to one union member.


Local 2 is threatening a citywide strike if the hotels do not offer some improvements over wages and benefits in an umbrella contract that just expired.


The union would like a $1 per hour raise across the board, improvements in dental coverage, and a policy allowing them to carry their five allotted days of sick leave from one year to the next.


All of the hotels are asking for concessions, according to union spokesperson Tim Reagan, such as the elimination of health benefits for retirees.


Hotel negotiators did not return reporters' calls about their position.


Negotiation is complicated by the fact that the union must negotiate separately with 20 different hotels and groups of hotels since the Hotel Employers Association, which negotiated the umbrella contract, fell apart last year.


Reagan said the union had set no deadline for a settlement, but that the two parties were far from agreeing.

Many Asian refugees in Seattle are without English skills, employment or financial resources. Most people in this situation would be part of the homeless population. But none of the estimated 25,000 Asian refugees can be found on the streets or in existing shelter systems. Where are they?


For the first time ever, the International District Community Health Center (IDCHC) is attempting to locate and provide services for the homeless Asian Pacific population in Seattle. This outreach is part of Seattle's Health Care for the Homeless Project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.


Presently, there is an unknown number of homeless Asians living in Seattle. The IDCHC wants to get a more accurate picture of this population. ""We want to help the homeless work through the barriers that hamper their success,"" says Lori Zumwalt, Community Health Nurse at the IDCHC.


Zumwalt explained that ""homeless"" doesn't necessarily mean people wandering the streets without shelter. ""Homeless"" can also mean people living in overcrowded and temporary housing situations. ""We are assuming that there are a lot of Asian refugees living like this,"" she said.


Letters to community organizations, posters in various languages, newspaper articles and door-to-door work is being done to locate the Asian homeless population. Once a client is located, someone will assess the person's health care needs and find out what can be done to resolve his housing problem. Personal visits will be made if necessary.


""We can refer people to various agencies and look into subsidized housing, but unfortunately, there are still over 3,000 homeless in Seattle and only 1,500 beds available,"" Zumwalt says. ""But if there are homeless Asians in Seattle, we would like to find them and help them as best we can.""

NEW YORK -- A federal prosecutor Tuesday formally charged the international United Bamboo crime syndicate with murdering Chinese American journalist Henry Liu on the orders of Taiwanese government officials.


""In response to the suggestion of officials in Taiwan,"" the 11 defendants conspired to kill Liu because ""he wrote a critical biography about Taiwan's president,"" prosecutor Anne T. Vitale told the jury, according to daily newspaper accounts.


The gang is also accused of smuggling heroin, selling marijuana, operating gambling casinos, transporting guns, extortion, bribery and kidnapping in the United States.


The alleged gang members' lawyers offered a variety of defenses in their opening statements. Some agreed that Taiwan's government had ordered the killing.


Lawrence J. Gross acknowledged that Tung Kueisen ""may well have been involved in the murder of Henry Liu,"" but said he was not involved in any other crime and ""he thought he was acting as a patriot.""


Other lawyers argued that their clients were businessmen innocently caught up in the international machinations.


Vitale promised the jury that during the course of a trial expected to last 8-10 weeks, they would get ""a rare glimpse of what the defendants themselves call the underworld,"" featuring accounts of dark ceremonies attended by Chinese American police agents who had infiltrated the gang, and about 200 secretly recorded conversations in Mandarin and Cantonese.

Chinese American Cops


They are Chinese Americans. They are police officers. And San Francisco has recognized their outstanding courage and skill in serving the public in 1985.


While working a plainclothes vice detail Oct. 17, Albert L. Lum and his three partners saw flames flickering through the windows of the sixth floor apartments at 685 Geary St.


They radioed back to the station, then ran into the building to warn the occupants. They climbed to the sixth floor, shouting and pounding on doors. There they found an elderly woman, dazed by the thick smoke and scorching heat wandering directly toward the center of the fire.


Sergeant Richard Weick and officer Gordon Clark helped the woman to safety while Lum and Manuel Solano found other endangered residents. Between them the four policemen soon rescued 50 of the buildings occupants.


On the night of June 24 Bryan Woo and his partner. Robert Bohanan responded to a report of a man throwing furniture from his seventh floor apartment at 880 Franklin St.


When they arrived on the scene, the man ordered them to stay away, threatening to leap from the building if they appreached him. They called for support, and soon the fire department arrived to rig a net.


But the fire fighters failed in their maneuvers to pin the man against the railing of his window, and he . . . Bohanan came from . . . just in time to catch him by his collar in mid-air, nearly being dragged over the railing himself by the weight. As the man flailed desperately, his shirt ripped and once again he would have plunged to his death had Bohanan not seized his hair.


Woo arrived and grasped the man's shirt sleeve, but again he struggled and broke free, pulling Bohanan even further over the rail. In a final lunge, Woo grabbed the arm of the would-be suicide, and with Bohanan hoisted him to saftey.


On the nigh of May 20 Officers Jonathan Fong and Albert Lum responded to a call from the Barclay Hotel. There they saw a man hurling furniture and broken glass at the pedestrians below his second floor window. Obtaining a passkey, the two entered his room.


A blood-spattered, knife-wielding figure whirled to face them as they came in. Muttering insanely, he advanced towards them and brandished the blade.


Fong and Lum ordered him to drop his weapon, but he refused and they rushed him. Though he fought viciously, the two succeeded in disarming the man and took him into custody without injury to him or themselves.


These officers all received. Bronze Medals of Valor from the San Francisco Police Department in a Dec. 20 ceremony at the Hall of Justice.


The Inimitable Isozaki


An obscure poet, an impish aesthete, and a famous architect, Arata Isozaki appeared on the cover of California magazine this month because he has recently left his mark on Los Angeles as on so many cities across the globe.


Isozaki may be the greatest Japanese architect ever, According to some critics, he is the greatest architect alive.


He designed the Bjornson House in L.A., the Hauserman Showroom in Chicago, the Tsukuba Center Building near Tokyo, the interior of the Palladium in New York, a Civic Center expansion in Phoenix, and the Sports Hall for the 1992. Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona--the most important commission ever received by a Japanese architect in Europe.


He has also been called the first Japanese architect who can talk about architecture.


""When I work, I think a lot Isozaki told the magazine. ""The final result, the building, is only a small part of that thinking. The writing that I do later is a part of the total expression.""


He has published extensively on the subject of architecture dumb founding his readers with poetic, bizarre, ironic, absurd--and sometimes comprehensible pro- nouncements.


It is the design of the L.A. Museum of Contemporary Art that has attracted most attention to him in California . . . colored geometrical set of somewhat incongruous shapes made from red Indian . . . onyx panels, red . . . green aluminum siding . . . MOCA committee selected . . . over several other . . . famous architects on the . . . his life's work.


""The golden section of the West, a method of dividing space, and the Positive-Negative theory of the East, a method of breaking space down, and the Homage of the two,"" Isozaki stated in description of the building. ""I should have added in L.A. air and sunshine.


""...To build MOCA, I took the total volume of the space and broke it into fragments, and then I broke the fragments down again. The fragments surround the patio-type, depressed courtyard. The total volume, after all, isn't important, because the actual mass can't be seen. The actual mass is the space in between the people who will be there.


""The fragments that remain are basic, fundamental geometrics. They are what we call platonic solids. The cube, the vault the pyramid--these are the symbols. As for what they mean, well like a lot of my work, it is ambiguous.""


He works like a maniac, arriving at his studio in the early morning and laboring until midnight. He claims not to have missed work on a Sunday or holiday in over two years. And he drives his drafters--a crew hailing from Japan, Sweden, Ireland and the U.S.--just as hard.


Much of his work represents an effort to synthesize the divergent aesthetics of East and West.


""When working in Japan. I present traditional Western motifs with Japanese sensibility,"" he explained. ""When working abroad. I attempt to analyze Japanese motifs after the patterns of Western logic. Since I have been recently traveling back and forth with great frequency, this duality has become part of my basic approach. In a certain sense, it has become my own way of searching for myself.


""I don't want to be a Japanese architect. I am only an architect. I just happen to work here. I am not a delegate for the Japanese people. It is my wish to discover, among the various media available, that medium which best lends itself to effective communication, even though it may be an unstable and disorganized medium. I think that designing architecture is one of just such media. It is a professional means of communication.""


The Taking Of The City


In their trim brown uniforms they marched into position at 0800, Feb. 3.


Within minutes the 41 troopers had occupied every major office of City government without firing a shot or spilling a drop of blood.


Much of their success must be attributed to the collaboration of the locals, however. The Boy Scouts really depended on Sheriff Mike Hennesev and others who guided the boys through their work for a full day.


At the post of ""Sheriff for the day,"" and dogging Hennesey's every movement, was Star Scout Nelson Yee, who at 13 years of age has already spent almost half his life in service to the Scouts. He is also attending courses at St. Peter and Paul School at the eighth grade level.


""I was honored to be named chairman of this worthy event,"" Hennesey remarked later. ""Boy Scouts in Government Day provides an excellent opportunity for young people to learn what really makes democracy tick.


""These scouts represent the future of our city and our nation and we must encourage their interest in local government and their commitment to its betterment.""


The Honor Roll

LOS ANGELES -- ""Register to vote, It's Your Right"" was the theme of Korean American Coalition's second annual awards banquet. A gala event, it was held in the Cocoanut Grove Room of the Ambassodor Hotel.


KAC honored three outstanding members of the Korean community for their support and committment to KAC. David Hyun, architect, founding board member of KAC, Chairman of Japanese Village Plaza; Jae Min Chang, publisher of Korea Times Los Angeles, Inc.; and Keith Kim.


President Tong Soo Chung invited Dr. John McCarthy from Governor Duekmejian office, Counsul General of Korea Ki Soo Kim, and L.A. Councilman Zeb Yaroslavsky to do the honors of presenting the placques to the honorees.


Keynote speaker for the evening was Alfred Song, former Senator of California and now working for District Attorney John Van de Camp. Humorously. Song remarked that he had never been with so many Koreans and wondered where they were were in 1960 (when he was running for office of state Senator). He recalled that there were then only 500 in Los Angeles and 2500 in the whole state of California.


The event was the kick off for the organized mass registration of voters. Song's topic was ""Why Vote?"" He felt that he was addressing a majority of naturalized American citizens born in Korea and reminded them that only 35 years ago immigrants of Korea were ineligible for citizenship and they were deemed to be unfit to become American Citizens. Therefore, they could not vote. Today, the laws have changed, Koreans are eligible for citizenship and have the right to vote.


Song said he was appalled at a recent poll that the Asian potential voters were practically nil--1 percent of a certain Asian group.


Comments or excuses presented were: one vote doesn't count; predominate preoccupation to excel academically -- to become lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers --too busy to take the time out to vote: Song explained that the time the first Asian immigrants came to the United States in the mid 1800s depended upon political activity and a political decision. This country, specially California, historically regarded the Orientals with aversion and suspicion. Early Oriental settlers were shunned and abused. Shameful laws of exclusion were enacted.


""For these early settlers in the United States, gaining economic security and economic status was a long and discouraging and upstream struggle against a strong current,"" he said, quoting from the late President John F. Kennedy's book, A Nation of Immigrants, ""Our behavior toward immigrants from the Orient represented a shameful episode in our relationships to those seeking the hospitality of American shores.""


Song told about the year 1884 when the California Supreme Court upheld the validity of a statute denying the right of Orientals to give testimony in court against white persons.


Song continued to tell about Oriental children being excluded from public schools as were the Negroes and Indians, and that Congress passed the first Chinese Exclusion Act first act of the United States to restrict the immigration of an entire race of a people.


""In 1892 the exclusionary provision was extended for another ten years. In 1902 the ban on Chinese was made permanent. Those in governing positions in this country did not look too kindly upon people of Oriental extraction,"" added Song.


""The formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League in San Francisco on May 14th, 1905 marked the beginning of the organized campaign against the Japanese and which continued throughout WWII


""On Oct 11, 1906, the San Francisco school board ordered all Japanese and Korean pupils to join the Chinese in the Oriental School. This led to the first national attempt to check Japanese immigration.


""In 1913 the California legislature enacted the Webb-Heney Bill, or Alien Land Act. This statute prohibited the ownership of land by aliens ineligible for citizenship under federal naturalization laws. Inasmuch as only 'free white' persons and 'African' natives could become naturalized citizen and with Chinese aliens already excluded since 1882, all aliens from the Orient were now disqualified from owning land in California,"" Song said.


""In 1922 the United State Supreme Court held that, under existing federal law, Japanese aliens could not become naturalized American citizens. Thus both Chinese and Japanese immigrants were destined to become permanent aliens, nonvoting residents of the United States -- the Chinese, by legislative, enactment: the Japanese, by judicial ruling. The Koreans were grouped with the Japanese,"" Song said.

Bowl-a-thons are great money-makers, says the organizer of a recent fundraiser which generated about $2,500 in four hours.


Dorothy Cordova, chair of the Filipino Youth Activities (FYA) Bowl-a-thon, explained that bowl-a-thons make great fundraisers because the planning is minimal, overhead is low, and moreover, a lot of fun is in store for the participants.


Over 40 youth and adults, ranging in age from eight to 55, gathered April 12 at Imperial Lanes to raise money for the FYA Khordobah Drill Team. The drill team is preparing for a July, 1986 tour of California, with possible stops in Disneyland and Mexico.


For some of the bowlers, the goal of sunny California and Disneyland was enough to knock over those tenpins. Others were driven by the incentive provided by sponsors who pledged money for every game bowled or for every pin knocked down.


""Somebody had the nerve to bet me a dime per pin,"" said Jon Frederick Ragudos, a drill team member who bowled two games of 145 and 170.


Although Jon Frederick's scores put him in the top 10 among the youth, he was beat out by Tracy Sumaong who bowled 178. The high game for the adults was 188, bowled by Patricia Walker, a member of Pacific Northwest Bell's Central City Community Relations Team. The Community Relations (CR) Team is a voluntary organization which supports a variety of community groups and centers, including the FYA, the Central Area Youth Association and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.


FYA youth and adult program volunteers were joined in their fundraising efforts by 13 members of the CR Team Mary Bailey, Sandra L. Bell, Nina Davis Espi Grundy, Dennis Hagberg, Anita Hidalgo, Marion Holloway, Courtney Jelaco, Johnny Jenkins, Dianne Ramsey, John Tester, Patricia Walker and Deirdre Wisdom.


Anita Hidalgo, CR team member and drill team parent, said: ""The consensus of the group is they want to do it again because they enjoyed it so much.""

MANILA -- A high-ranking Philippine official got caught up in a battle of alliteration last month when he was accused of advertising sexual commodities to foreign tourists.


Tourism Minister Antonio Gonzales denied a columnist's charge that he was trying to attract visitors to the islands by offering them ""sun, sand, sex, San Miguel (beer) and safety,"" Agence France-Presse reported.


Another columnist said Gonzales offered ""beer, beaches, broads, burns and barricades.""


""I never said that the Philippines was known for sun, sand, sex and San Miguel,"" Gonzales claimed. ""What I said... was, 'No more sex tours. What the Philippines will promote now are sunset, swimming and shopping. I subsequently added another 'S': safety.""


During the 1970s and early 1980s many Japanese and Western tourists took tours to the Philippines in which meetings with prostitutes were part of the package arranged by travel agencies.


Protests by Filipino and Japanese women ended the practice, AFP said.


The islands are struggling to regain the income from tourism which was lost during the years of political turmoil that climaxed in the downfall of President Ferdinand Marcos. The number of tourists has declined sharply since it reached its peak of 1 million in 1980.

LOS ANGELES -- Hundreds of demonstrators met Monday outside Monterey Park's City Hall to protest the council's rejection of plans for a senior housing project, and its recent resolution supporting English as the country's official language and calling for local authorities to cooperate with immigration officials.


A coalition calling itself the Committee Against Age and Racial Discrimination and spear-headed by the Taiwanese American Citizens League charged the council with racism in the recent votes which came shortly after 3 new members were elected to the city council.


""These resolutions were certainly racially motivated,"" said Li Pei Wu, who is the chair of the committee and the president of the league. he said the immigration and official language resolution ""kills the ethnic diversity that made this nation great,"" and encouraged the harrassment of immigrants by local police.


The council's decision to deny the housing project shows racial bias since the previous city council and the planning commission voted for the project, Wu said.


City Councilwoman Pat Reichenberger, who voted for the resolution and against the housing project, disputed these charges.


""We have a lot of illegal Mexicans here and it's affecting health and sanitation"" by putting extra strain on the community's facilities, she said. ""But we simply asked authorities to enforce the immigration law. We never directed the police to stop people to see if they are illegal.""


The council rejected the housing project because it was inappropriate for the area which is dominated by single-family homes, and because it was poorly designed, she said. The housing would have been open to people of all ethnic origins.


""These charges of racism are just camouflage,"" she said. ""The people who protested were mostly out-of-town developers.""


Li Pei Wu is the president of the General Bank of Commerce, a Los Angeles-based bank catering to a largely Chinese American clientele. According to Robert Lin, the project coordinator for the Taiwanese American Affiliated Committee, the organization sponsoring the development, General Bank of Commerce would have financed the construction of the project with a loan of about $3.1 million on which it would have charged interest of the prime rate plus 1-1.5 percent.


Wu said, however, that the project's financing would come from the Federal Housing and Urban Development Department and that the General Bank of Commerce was not involved in the financing in any way.


According to the city's Community Development director, Henry Terashita, a city ordinance, ""proposition K,"" limits to 12 the number of units that may be constructed in any new development, unless the development has government funding. The development would have had 43 units.


The Taiwanese American Affiliated Committee would have met that requirement by seeking an issue of county bonds to pay back its loans, but the committee had not gotten as far as applying for either HUD or county money, Lin said.


The committee's initial proposal would have put 75 units on 55,000 square feet, including 22,000 square feet in the neighboring community of Rosemead. The Rosemead city government also rejected the proposal after many residents of the area signed a petition opposing it, so the proposal was scaled down to the 33,000 feet and 43 units in Monterey Park.


Monterey Park Mayor G. Monty Manibog denied that the demonstration was led by developers.


""It's all people living in the community,"" he said. ""A lot of them are elderly people who want housing.""


He moved in the council meeting Monday night to repeal the resolution, but the move was defeated.


David Almada, one of the councilmembers defeated in the recent elections, charged that the campaign that unseated him exploited a backlash against the wave of Asian immigrants, who now account for 40 percent of the city's 58,000 residents.


Reichenberger characterized his statements as ""out and out lies."" She said the basis of her campaign was to slow development in the town, which she said included a lot of unattractive condominiums and shopping malls built by the new immigrants. The council has imposed a complete moratorium on new construction.


""I would have been long gone out of Monterey Park if I was a racist,"" she said. ""It really hurts, due to the fact that I like ethnic diversity. I don't want anyone to leave Monterey Park.""


Wu said he hoped the council would reconsider its decisions soon, so that his group would not find it necessary to mount a recall campaign against the new councilmembers.


""But if the council does not change its policies we will have to react,"" he said.

With subdued inflation moderate economic growth and no credit crunch, interest rates may not yet have bottomed out -- even though rates have fallen fast and furious during the past year. For homeowners who have considered refinancing their mortgage, the news has been good and may well stay that way.


Lower rates have obviously made it easier for many people to refinance their homes. Through refinancing they can reduce interest payments and subsequently reduce their monthly home payments.


But that's not the only reason there has been so much activity. People also see new opportunities to own homes of greater value. It's not like the old days, when a lot of people bought homes because they were a good investment. Now, many people are buying more expensive homes because rates are low and because they like the homes; they want to live in them. A lot of people aren't buying and hoping to sell for a profit a couple of years later.


We're also seeing a switch from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages. For the most part, fixed-rate mortgages are a bit cheaper today than adjustable-rates were a year ago.


In addition, some people are exchanging higher-interest 30-year mortgages for lower-rate 15-year mortgages. Monthly payments may be comparable, but that kind of switch can significantly reduce interest paid over the life of the mortgage.


But the decision to refinance involves more than just a lower interest rate. Every homeowner has to look carefully at refinancing before moving ahead with it. You have to consider whether it's right for you to refinance, not whether it's the trend and something you think you should do.


Although interest rates are down, the homeowner must take into account the points involved. (A point is a fee charged by the lender -- up front -- that is, apart from the interest. A point is equal to one percent of the total principal of the loan.). You also have to look at the closing costs involved, and at the monthly payments.


Let's say your interest rate is 9.5 percent with three points on a 30-year mortgage. The effective interest rate is 9.86 percent. If your mortgage is for $75,000, your monthly payments would be $650, or about $20 per month more than with a straight 9.5 percent mortgage with no points.


When you add in closing costs, which could be the equivalent of two-and-a-half to four points, the impact would be even greater. The question is whether the savings is substantial enough to warrant refinancing. The rule of thumb is that it takes three years to realize a real savings.


In the example used before, let's say your original $75,000 mortgage was at 12 percent, with monthly payments of $771. Your monthly payments after refinancing would save you about $5,076 over three years -- less $4,125 for 5.5 percent in points and closing costs. So if you plan to sell in the near future, refinancing is probably not a wise choice.


Some people are finding that with lower interest rates, they can afford the monthly payments of a 15-year mortgage. It takes a little more immediate sacrifice, but the savings in interest are amazing over the long run.


You can get a 15-year mortgage at a lower rate than a 30-year mortgage, but for the sake of illustration, let's look at the difference between a 15-year loan and a 30-year loan at the same rate. On a 9.5 percent loan over 30 years, payments on a $75,000 mortgage would be $630 a month. The same loan for 15 years would result in a monthly payment of $770. But while the 30-year mortgage would cost you a total of $227,160, the 15-year loan is paid off with $138,600. That's a savings of more then $88,500 -- for those who can afford the higher monthly payments.


As you can see, your decision to refinance depends on more than just interest rates. But with all the positive influences, it is definitely worth your while to explore the advantages.

SACRAMENTO -- Citing a cancerous spread of criminal gangs in California, the state Bureau of Organized Crime is calling for 2 new specialists to triple the size of its Asian gang department.


The arrival of major gangs from Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong and the expansion of domestic Chinese and Vietnamese gangs are part of an ""explosive growth"" of organized crime that is leading to a ""huge jump"" in gang-related violence, according to a report by the attorney general.


The Chinese gambling game Pal Gow has ""mushroomed"" since it was introduced to California 2 years ago, according to Tony Crittenden, an Asian gang specialist at the bureau, providing Chinese and Vietnamese gangs with a new source of income.


The success of Pai Gow is leading to the introduction of other Asian gambling games in California card clubs, many of which are operated by the Wah Ching, the dominant Chinese American gang, according to the report.


The attorney general's office has called Pai Gow illegal, but injunctions prevent prosecution of the game operators, pending court hearings in Emeryville, Los Angeles, Stockton, Calexico and other cities, Crittenden said.


The Wah Ching, founded by Hong Kong immigrants, currently has about 700 members and is forming close ties with the centuries-old Chinese ""triads,"" many of whose 80,000 members hope to immigrate to the United States before Hong Kong comes under the control of mainland China in 1997, according to the report.


Already some of the triads are active in California, including the Wo Hop To and 14K which are suspected of financing Southern California businesses, and the Luen Kung which is said to be purchasing property in Los Angeles and Canada.


The attorney general's annual organized crime report to the legislature outlined the following other developments in Asian gang activity:


Chinese youth gangs are recruiting Vietnamese gang members and providing them with more effective organization. One gang, the Frogmen, is composed of former members of the South Vietnamese military underwater demolition team. Its alleged leader, Cac Van Tran is employed at a Pai Gow game in a Southern California card club.


The Viet Ching, a gang of Chinese youths from Vietnam with a membership of about 225, has been committing heavily armed robberies throughout California.


United Bamboo, the 40,000-member Taiwanese gang responsible for murdering Chinese American journalist Henry Liu, is operating and recruiting new members in Los Angeles, Monterey Park, San Francisco and Daly City.


The Yakuza, a group of 2,300 Japanese gangs with 100,000 members, is increasing its drug trafficking and weapons purchases in Hawaii and California, and is laundering money in Southern California. The gangs, who trace their origins to dissident Samurai groups of the 18th century, are heading for a showdown between rival factions.


""There are a lot of problems to overcome"" in combating Asian gangs, Crittenden said. ""You have to develop an expertise in the background of the communities.""


He said an ""inherent fear of law enforcement"" in Asian immigrant communities means that the majority of crimes are unreported. Vietnamese immigrants are particularly wary of police officers because they come from a country where the police were corrupt.


The state is planning a new training program to help the police overcome these and other cultural stumbling blocks, such as a misinterpretation by some Asians of the bail system as bribery.


The attorney general's office is also trying to establish a liaison with the Asian American business community, and to help recruit more Asian police officers, Crittenden said.


In a press release Attorney General John Van de Kamp warned that narcotics trafficking was a particular danger, one that could make California ""join prohibition-era Chicago and Miami in the early '80s as notorious examples of communites overwhelmed by organized crime.""


He lamented the failure of state legislation that would have allowed some forms of electronic surveillance against gangs.


Van de Kamp supported bills before the legislature that would enable police to clamp down on money laundering and clandestine drug labs and to confiscate more illegal assets.

""Unbound Spirit,"" the resident company of the Asian American Dance Collective, will present the works of five Asian American choreographers for two week, ends at the New Performance Gallery, 3151 17th St. (near Shotwell), San Francisco. Performances will be Fir.-Sat., May 30-31, June 6-7, at 8:30 p.m., and Sun., June 1, 7 p.m.


Works by Carol Murota Alleluia Panis, Anna Sun (artistic director of the group). Jill Togawa and June Watanabe will feature their interpretation of the Asian American experience in dance.


Some samples were revealed at a reception-exhibition at Major Pond's in San Francisco March 15.


These brief glimpses of the forthcoming programs made one eager to see the whole, and Ms. Sun spoke effectively about the blending of eastern-western tradition and the search for a fusion which really represents Asian Americans today.


A mixed Asian-Caucasian audience was very appreciative. Even the food at this charming event was mixed: sushi, ham sandwiches, lox, quiche, fresh fruit, strawberry cheese cake, all visually handsome and prepared, we are told, by the Collective Board, along with exquisite Hawaiian flowers.


The Asian American Dance Collective was formed in 1974 ""to teach, create, and perform dance in San Francisco's Asian communities."" By now a cultural staple, its new season looks very promising indeed.


San Francisco's Asian community has a wealth of talent. Now is the time to support it and make a make on the S.F. oultural landscape. For more info, write Asian American Dance Collective, 1519 Mission St., San Francisco, 94103, phone 552-8980.

SEOUL -- There's a tradition here of eating dogs and it revolts many of the athletes who are present to participate in the Asian Games.


Even though it is now illegal to cook dogs in South Korea, many chefs ignore the law, and as a result there has been a sudden surge in demand for chicken dishes, Agence France-Presse reports.


""With chicken you are never fooled; they look alike around the globe, so we are choosing that,"" one Indian athlete said.


Officials in Seoul cracked down on purveyors of canine meat in July, arresting five men for butchering 18,000 dogs. And two weeks before that they caught two restaurant owners serving dog soup.


The arrests were intended to ease the fears of the foreign athletes here, but their nervousness has not been entirely dispelled, particularly among the visitors from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan.

Compiled by International District Emergency Center


We responded to a radio call of a stabbing near a local bar. Police were already on the scene. The male victim, who had been stabbed in the side, was still walking around and talking despite the severity of the wound. Medic One treated the victim, then transported him to Harborview Medical Center in stable condition. A suspect was arrested at the scene.


On patrol, we noticed a torn blanket near a large wooden box turned sideways. Upon closer inspection, we saw that someone was sleeping in the box. We recognized the middle-aged person as someone with a history of mental illness. He had nowhere else to sleep and was left at the site.


That same night, we found another man lying behind a local bank. He was intoxicated, but uninjured. We left him there.


We arrived ahead of Aid crews to a local shelter to treat a sick individual. The man had been ill for one-and-a-half weeks, but was in stable condition. Since the situation was not a true emergency, we cancelled the call for the Aid car, then called for an ambulance to take the man to Harborview.


We went to another shelter to check an elderly woman who was suffering from a chronic breathing problem. She was in stable condition. We explained to her what had been causing her problem: smoking. She was taken to a local hospital for observation.


We frequently see persons who, after smoking for many years, suffer a variety of breathing problems when they get older.


On patrol, we noticed a young man on a bike looking into cars in some of the International District parking lots. We scared the youth away before he got into any cars. Police, who were informed of the situation, knew the individual.


We also came upon two men hanging around several parked cars near the north end of the District. The men left when they saw us.


There have been many car break-ins in the International District -- almost daily. Police have sent special units to patrol the downtown area to help reduce this growing problem.


Medics were called to the scene of a reported stabbing. They arrived, waited for police to secure the area, then went in. The female victim had sustained some deep facial cuts and was bleeding. Police questioned other persons at the scene. The victim had been cut by another woman with a knife. The assailant had fled the scene. An Aid car transported the victim to Harborview.


That same night, we responded to a man who had a seizure in a local hotel lobby. He was just coming out of the seizure when we arrived. The victim, in stable condition, was transported by ambulance to Harborview.


While returning from a service call, we noticed a fire hydrant that had been knocked off its foundation by a car. The hydrant lay in the middle of the sidewalk. There was no car in the area and no store owners on the block had bothered to call in the problem. We notified both the fire and water departments of the situation.


Remember: It is very important to call if you see a damaged or leaking fire hydrant. In an emergency, fire departments may have to use the hydrant to save a life or put out a fire.


We were called in to check on a man who had reportedly passed out in his hotel room. But when we arrived, we found no one there. The next day, we were again called to the same room. This time, the man was home, but refused service, even though he was ill.


Eire units responded to an automatic alarm which went off in a local hotel. Normally, the alarm was triggered by water sent into the sprinkler system. We arrived to find no fire, smoke, odor or water. The alarm had malfunctioned, a common problem.


In another incident, a smoke alarm went off in a local apartment. We joined fire units in responding to the alarm, which, it turned out, had gone off when someone had burnt their snack. There were no injuries.


Several weeks ago, fire units responded to an apartment fire, this time called in by police. As heavy black smoke poured from the building, fire crews rushed into their pre-planned fire attack. The engine supplied the standpipes. The crew from the ladder company rushed to the fire floor to rescue a victim reportedly still in the room. Other crews brought up the fire hose, fans and forcible entry tools. Medics waited below, readying their equipment to treat the victim. Dense smoke was reported in all floors above the fire. Fire crews -- including medics -- reached the fire room and made an attack on the room. They found a victim in the room, but he was already beyond help.


The fire was put out and crews remained at the scene to clean up. The fire may have started from a smoldering fire which burst into flames when the victim opened a window.


Medics were called to Sixth Avenue and South King Street to aid a man who had been beaten to the ground by several males. He had almost been stabbed, but several persons came to his assistance. The victim, who had sustained a head injury, was taken to Harborview. The assailants fled in an out-of-state vehicle.


We noticed a man who had broken a bottle, then said he was going to get back at someone. We called police, who quickly seized the man before any trouble started.


Does you agency want a basic fire safety, first aid or security course? We teach these courses free to any non-profit International District agency. Contact the International District Emergency Center through the International Examiner.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Secretary of State March Fong Eu hinted she might run for U.S. Senator or Governor of Oalifornia if she again wins reelection by a landslide this year.


Eu, who in her last election garnered the highest number of votes ever cast for a candidate in the history of California, was coy about her political plans when she attended a recent Chinatown luncheon meeting with Asian American leaders who are planning a huge fundraiser for her on Tuesday, Sept. 30.


Early plans for the Sept. 30 event are ambitious, aiming to raise more than $50,000 for Eu's campaign for reelection to her fourth term as Secretary of State.


While political observers expect Eu to win easily in November, she said she is taking nothing for granted and would like to repeat her landslide of four years ago.


""I'd like to do very well in November so that if I decide later that I want to run for something else, (potential opponents) will say, 'Let her run alone -- she's too strong to beat',"" Eu said to an enthusiastic audience of about 70 leaders from the Filipino, Korean, Japanese and Chinese American communities.


Eu who is a Democrat, told Asian Week she is keeping her options open to run against Republican Sen. Pete Wilson when he runs for reelection in 1988. And if Republican Gov. George Deukmejian beats Tom Bradley in November, Eu may run for that office in 1990.


""If I want to run for Senate, I will have to start work right away. I would only have two years to prepare for the election,"" Eu told Asian Week.


Appellate Court Justice Harry Low, who also attended the Chinatown luncheon, said Eu's candidacy and election to either the Senate seat or the governor's office are ""a very real possibility"" but said it is much too early to decide whether she will actually run.


Numerous speakers at the luncheon praised Eu's effectiveness as the third highest ranking elected constitutional officer in the state.


Newly appointed S.F. Supervisor Tom Hsieh also dropped by to ""pay respects to my leader, the woman who first brought me into politics several years ago.""


Low said that in the dawning of the age of the Pacific Rim, it was essential for Asian Americans to rally solidly behind Eu to give her a strong victory and thus show their capabilities as an ethnic group. He urged the leaders present to promote the ""unity rally"" scheduled to be held at Portsmouth Square on the day of the March Fong Eu fundraiser. Eu will be the keynote speaker at the rally, which will focus on election issues such as Proposition 63, which would declare English the official language of the state, and Proposition 64, which would force registration, quarantine and possibly incarceration of people exposed to the AIDS virus.

Frank Sato, president of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) feels that most Americans look at Japanese Americans with a ""strange dichotomy.""


On one hand, he said, people are losing jobs and blaming it on the trade imbalance between this country and the Pacific Rim nations. On the other hand there is an increasing affinity for Asian culture, with widespread interest in such subjects as sushi and martial arts. In both cases, Sato feels Americans are relating to Americans of Japanese descent for the wrong reasons.


""I don't think the average American understands Japanese culture,"" he said.


Because most Americans do not distinguish between Japanese Americans and Japanese from Japan, he feels the JACL must ""alert and sensitize"" America to the issues and problems currently confronting the national Japanese American community.


JACL, founded in San Francisco in 1929, acts as an educational, human and civil rights organization for Japanese Americans. The group has 114 chapters nationwide and boasts a total of 27,000 members.


Sato serves voluntarily as national JACL president. He works as Inspector General for the Veteran's Administration, serving as one of the highest-ranking Asian American appointees in the Reagan administration. His position allows him to express the concerns of JACL to members of the administration and Congress.


The issues he and JACL advocate strongly for are:


-- Redress: Sato said redress for losses incurred by Japanese Americans during their World War II internment is ""a constitutional issue that needs to be clarified."" Current legislation pending in Congress stipulates that each surviving member of the forced evacuation be awarded $20,000.


Forty-five years after the internment occurred, he said, people ask him, ""Why bring it up now?""


Sato replies that 10 percent of the population knows that the internment took place. And 69 to 70 percent of the population was not even born prior to 1942. History books, Sato added, say nothing about the internment and need to accurately describe the incident. But he feels that passage of redress legislation is going to be a ""tough, tough, tough battle.""


""It's not an issue of $20,000,"" Safo said. ""It's an educational issue -- to make sure that it will never happen again.""


-- Development of leaders: Studies indicate that Asian Americans acquire more education than any other group in the country, yet still lag behind their white counterparts in income. Sato attributes this to the lack of Asian and Japanese Americans in leadership positions.


""How many Asian American heads of corporations do you know of?"" he asked. ""Right now, we're just knocking at the door. There are four Japanese American members of Congress. We're doing very well locally, but not nationally. There needs to be a leadership push.""


-- Nisei aging and retirement: One JACL goal is ""to promote the rich heritage of our people,"" Sato said. ""We are born into that heritage, some try and escape it during adulthood, then revert back to it when they get older. It's a full circle back to their heritage.""


Sato notes that, as the majority of the Nisei quickly approach retirement age, more programs will be required to deal with their aging. The JACL has established an aging and retirement program to examine and implement further support programs.


-- Out-marriage: At a recent JACL-sponsored conference in Fresno on the topic of bi-racial marriages, Sato said, one sansei described an incident concerning his Caucasian wife and bi-racial son. At a supermarket, a woman noticed the son, then said to the wife, ""How could you marry somebody like that?""


""There needs to be more support for biracial families,"" Sato said.


-- Building coalitions: World War II pitted the Japanese and Chinese against each other, here and abroad, with the Chinese making their ethnicity clear so they would not be mistaken for Japanese.


Sato recalled that newly-elected Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo recently visited him and the Japanese American members of Congress while in Washington D.C.


""Up until 10 or 15 years ago, the Chinese and the Japanese in this country didn't have much to do with each other,"" Sato said. ""We need to work on building strong ties.""


-- Anti-Asian American violence: In 1985, JACL compiled a report on violent crimes against Asian Americans and distributed the study to every member of Congress. The report sought to expose the magnitude of the problem, and included a chronological listing of violent crimes against Asian Americans since 1981.


The JACL also used the report to educate and sensitize the media on their portrayals of Asians. Sato cited an incident where General Motors used an advertisement that stated. ""Get your Jap-zappers here.""


At the same time, Congressman Norm Mineta has recently introduced a ""hate crime"" bill that would require law enforcement agencies to record and prosecute racially-motivated crimes.


Sato noted parallels between current anti-Asian sentiment and the mood in the country prior to World War II.


""The biggest act of anti-Asian American violence occurred in 1942,"" Sato said. ""Unless people blow the whistle right when it happens, there's going to be a lot more of this nonsense. We must alert and sensitize others and bring it to a head. Don't let people . . . with it. That's the basis of citizenship -- to bring it to a forefront.""


Sato sees a positive trend developing despite the ominous challenges facing Asian and Japanese Americans.


""Our young people are seeing the rightful place of the Japanese Americans,"" he said. ""We are in the throes of greater contributions. If only I could push our people a little more.""

The focus of investors who held stock in the now defunct United Bank, most of whom are Chinese Americans, now shifts toward KMG Main Hurdman, the $1 billion per year accounting firm which audited the bank's books.


A decision last year by the California Court of Appeal in Orange County opened the way for investors to sue accountants when companies audited by those accountants run into financial problems.


An attorney for a group of former United Bank shareholders charged that the bank's financial statement for Dec. 31, 1984, was ""materially false and misleading."" (See Asian Week, 8/1/86.)


The Federal Home Loan Bank Board refused to confirm or deny whether the financial statement was false. But Sau-Wing Lam, senior vice president and chief administrative officer of United Savings Bank, the new institution formed after Hibernia Bancshare's takeover, said it was his ""understanding"" that the government regulators had rejected the financial statement.


KMG Main Hurdman's international organization, Klynveld Main Goerdeler, based in the Netherlands, has annual revenues of more than $1 billion per year, of which $234 million is generated in the United States, according to the Wall Street Journal.


KMG Main Hurdman is the ninth largest accounting firm in the world. It has more than 12,000 employees in Europe, about 4000 in the Far East and close to 6500 in the U.S.


KMG Main Hurdman was formed in 1979 by the merger of Hurdman & Cranstoun and Main Lafrenz. It has since discussed mergers with most of the world's top accounting firms in an effort to boost its U.S. operations and to thus form the world's largest accounting firm.


The company made big news last year when it announced it was discussing a merger with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., the second biggest accounting firm in the world. The merger would have produced a firm with $2.5 billion in revenues per year. The discussions of a merger fell through because of the complexities of meshing the two organizations, the Journal reported.


Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., incidentally, is the firm auditing the books for the new United Savings Bank.


The paper added that KMG Main Hurdman was known to have discussed mergers with five other major firms in the previous year.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Vietnamese are the fastest growing Asian population in California, and may be at higher risk of cancer than other Asian peoples, says Stephen J. McPhee, M.D. and Christopher Jenkins, Ph.D. of the University of California here.


Understanding the implications of this combination in terms of human suffering and future health care costs is among the objectives of a $125,000, two-year research project funded by the California Division of the American Cancer Society, according to an ACS press release.


Preliminary data indicate 64 per cent of Vietnamese men smoke, more than twice the percentage of men in the general population. Since cigarette smoking causes 85 per cent of all lung cancers, this could mean 147 cases of lung cancer among every 100,000 Vietnamese men, compared to 81 per 100,000 among white men, the researchers say.


The 1980 census listed fewer than 6000 Vietnamese in San Francisco. An estimated 35,000 refugees from Indochina have flowed into The City since then.


In addition to risk of lung cancer, many Vietnamese men who smoke also are heavy drinkers, putting them at special risk of liver cancer, the investigators say.


There is concern that Vietnamese women may repeat the experience of other Asian immigrants, whose incidence of breast cancer increases dramatically when they move to this country. Changes in diet are suspected as a cause.


At present, however, there is virtually no data on the incidence of cancer among the Vietnamese in California or information on their know . . . acceptance of health habits that can reduce cancer risks.


With Vietnamese-speaking health workers, the new study will collect some of this missing information, and identify any cultural barriers to prevention and treatment of the most common cancers.


Dr. McPhee is an assistant professor of medicine at UCSF and a member of the professional education committee of the S.F. American Cancer Society. Chris Jenkins is a research associate in the UCSF department of internal medicine, and a member of the ACS public education committee.


Their grant was awarded from a fund of contributions earmarked by the donors for research.


Also recently awarded from this fund were three fellowships supporting scientific research at UCSF by Harma Ellens, Ph.D., $49,750; Harold E. Selick, Ph.D., $52,000 and Michael Verderame, Ph.D., $52,000.


A total of more than $3 million in American Cancer Society research funds has been awarded this year to UCSF researchers.

Japan-bashing ""has not died down"" in Washington, D.C. and threatens to bubble over into violence against Asian Americans, said Representative Norm Mineta of California last Sunday.


Mineta was in Seattle to attend a fundraiser for his friend and fellow Democrat Brock Adams, who is running for the U.S. Senate.


According to the Adams camp, one of the most recent examples of lashing out at the Japanese is a television commercial for Republican incumbent Sen. Slade Gorton. In the ad, a fisherman complains about the Japanese ""taking our fish"" and about Adams's lobbying for the Japanese fishing industry. Adams told the Seattle Times Sunday that the commercial was ""inflammatory.""


Mineta has been fighting the rhetoric in Congress for years and said he will continue to fight it. Inflammatory words can lead to inflammatory action. ""What I'm afraid of and what I keep looking for is to make sure this kind of trade tension doesn't explode into domestic racial tension,"" Mineta said.


""We have to sensitize members of the House and Senate so that Japan-bashing or Korea-bashing or Taiwan-bashing or Hong Kong-bashing don't become practices we see in debates.""


Sensitization, he said, must be done with a great deal of tact. After an offending speech or comment by a colleague, Mineta usually writes a polite letter welcoming debate on the issue at hand, but pointing out any racist-sounding statements. Later, he may make the same points in person. Representatives from areas with industries such as steel automobile and electronics feel most compelled to point fingers at the Japanese, said Mineta.


It's not that they don't have a valid complaint. It's the way they complain.


""I am as upset with some of the practices of the Japanese government on trade issues as they are,"" said Mineta. ""But I think there's a way of dealing with it without being racist.""


Japan-bashing, he said, ""doesn't make for good foreign policy, it doesn't make for good trade policy, it doesn't make for good ethnic politics.""


Mineta, in fact, has been outspoken in his criticism of Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's controversial remarks about the level of intelligence in the U.S. In September, Nakasone said, ""The average level of knowledge in the United States is far less than in Japan because of the blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans living (there).""


""The statement was an outrage,"" said Mineta. ""I was angered because it showed he didn't have any understanding of what the United States is all about, that our strength really comes from our diversity, that there are opportunities for people regardless of race, creed, color.


""I represent a district that is just five percent Asian and yet I'm a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.""


As a third-generation Japanese American, Mineta thought it especially important that he, along with fellow California Congressman Robert Matsui, show immediate disapproval of Nakasone's comments. The congressmen joined with black and Hispanic members of the House in censuring the Japanese leader, who issued an apology a few days later.


If Nakasone really wants to improve U.S.-Japan relations, Mineta said, he ought to encourage Japanese companies in America to improve their ties with this country's minorities. There are few, if any, black or Hispanic dealerships of Japanese cars, he observed.


On other issues that concern Asian Americans, Mineta is most interested in Asian American ""empowerment."" While much has been made in the media about the educational gains of young Asian Americans, there have been few high-level promotions of qualified Asians to supervisory or policy-making positions at private corporations or in government.


""When I see people being held back on an artificial basis, it infuriates me,"" he said. ""The excuse that Asians aren't aggressive managers or speak with an accent are shallow ones.""


Mineta pursues the issue in his speeches, articles and letters.


When he entered Congress in 1974, Mineta felt he was greatly helped by the reputation of the Asian Americans who preceded him: Senators Hiram Fong and Daniel Inouye, Spark Matsunaga and Patsy Mink among others. And now, as an Asian American in a position of power, he feels responsible for the next generation of Asian leaders.


""I've been fortunate in being able to climb the political ladder,"" he said. ""I feel an obligation to reach down and help someone else up here.""


Mineta, a six-term congressman who is virtually assured of a seventh term this November, serves on five subcommittees and chairs one: the public works and transportation subcommittee on aviation.


After the Adams fundraiser, the congressman winged his way back to Washington, D.C. where, he said, the most pressing issues of the current Congress were spending bills and the budget for fiscal year 1987.

WASHINGTON -- Radio listeners in the San Francisco area were asked ""Do you remember Pearl Harbor?"" in a recent political advertisement which links World War II with current U.S. trade relations with Japan, and San Jose Congressman Norman Y. Mineta said he is angered and surprised ""that this racial hysteria never seems to end.""


The ad, for Republican Tom Skornia, candidate in California's 12th Congressional District, begins with the reference to Pearl Harbor and mentions the U.S. trade situation.


""There is no reason to connect Pearl Harbor with U.S.-Japan trade relations today,"" Mineta said. ""Except ignorance and bigotry.""


""We cannot have cordial and positive relations with other nations when such rhetoric is used. And when Americans of Asian ancestry are victims of racially motivated violence, it is irresponsible to revive this old racial hysteria,"" Mineta said.

Asian American singles have difficulty establishing stable relationships because ""expectations become higher as a single individual becomes older,"" said a sociologist who recently conducted a workshop for Asian American singles over 30.


Chizuko ""Chiz"" Norton, sociologist and director of the Separation and Loss Institute, a non-profit counseling service operating out of Virginia Mason Hospital, held the workshop at the Blaine Memorial Methodist Church. She focused on the particular pressures facing. Japanese American singles hampered by traditional values.


""Lives with more options have created difficult lives with more decisions,"" Norton said.


Through contact mostly with Asian Americans outside of her practice, she finds that the most common problem facing singles over 30 is finding a partner and deciding whether to be married.


""When we hit 30, we say good-bye to the dreams of young adulthood,"" Norton said, quoting psychoanalyst Carl Jung. It is also a time when people assess their lives, she continued, with the ""personality submerged in youth starting to come out.""


Age 30 and over, she said, is a time of economic stability. Leisure activities change, with contact sports like football and basketball being dropped for golf and tennis. A single person will assume greater interest in children from contact with nieces and nephews, and begin relating to parents and others as an adult.


The parent-child relationship changes to adult-adult, with sons and daughters starting to care for their parents or pressures being placed on them to do so. Norton stated that the majority of Sansei women reside with their parents. Forty percent of Nisei men and 42 percent of Nisei women surveyed preferred living with their single daughters when older according to the the Nikkei Aging Project conducted by the late Professor Min Masuda in 1980.


""Being single can be dangerous,"" Norton said, quoting a single Sansei female because singles are viewed as ""not having any responsibilities.""


Individuals over 30 will be forced to accept biological and physical changes in their bodies. Hair will turn white and weight will change. Japanese Americans are especially concerned with these changes. Norton said, because ""Japanese place emphasis on appearance.""


The most significant decision for a single over 30 will be whether to become attached to someone or to remain a separate being. The singles friends will become married or involved in relationships, and the single will find it difficult to acquire a new set of friends. As a single becomes older, that person will feel that chances of finding a partner become less and less.


When searching for a partner, Norton explained, ""expectations become higher as a single individual becomes older, causing quicker barriers to be thrown up to those who do not meet the expectations.""


""We all have fairy-tale tapes running through our heads."" Norton said. ""Lower your expectations and you will find that there are people out there. Listen to what other people have to say. The society we live in is in such a rush, we only listen with a quarter of an ear.""


Asian Americans especially have a problem with shyness, Norton said, and ""the older they get, the shyer they get -- especially with a potential partner.""


Norton feels that Asian American single males are especially handicapped by the stereotype that characterizes them as quiet reticent, ""not being the life of the party and not asking anybody to dance."" Norton has heard Asian American females say of Asian American males. ""He's okay, but he's so quiet. He waits for me to make the first move.""


Norton attributes the shyness in Japanese Americans and difficulty in communicating to what the Issei said to the Nisei: ""Be careful what you do, what you say. People are going to be laughing at you."" She remembers when her mother admonished her for suggesting that she complain to the owner of a car that blocked the entrance to their home. ""Forget it,"" Norton's mother said. ""We all have to live together.""


Norton concludes that, compared to non-Asians, Nikkei males have difficulty showing affection because ""there are no shows of affection at home."" ""Love is certainly there,"" she said, ""but it's not outwardly shown.


""Asian American males have difficulty conversing,"" Norton said, noting that many female Nikkei clients seek counseling because their husbands never talk to them. She also knows a Nikkei professor who has to give himself pep talks in front of a mirror before lecturing to large classes.


But Norton also adds that the Asian American male is being compared with a predominantly white beauty standard, and ""the desired figure doesn't match up with Asian men.""


""He is not appreciated for his uniqueness,"" she said. ""Accept what he is and try to get to know him. He's interesting and exciting in his own way. Asian males are not given enough recognition for their strength and sensitivity. He has not been given a chance to show it.""


Norton recommends that singles searching for a partner try to make friends first. ""Practice in front of a mirror and picture yourself trying to make friends,"" she said. ""Notice what you say, how you say it, how you stand. Your future partner may be among one of those friends.""


Reverend Bob Hoshibata, minister of Blaine Memorial Methodist Church, hopes the church can provide an atmosphere for single people to meet each other as friends. He conceived the singles workshop along with Sharon Harada, a church member.


""At age 35 and over, one is not able to find enough people to do things with, who are not married or tied to a family or relate to the problems we face,"" Harada said.


""The church has a reputation as being family-oriented where only 'nice people' go."" Hoshibata said. ""We need to pay attention to the needs of singles and provide an atmosphere for people to meet without pressure to be a matchmaking service.""


""For people 40 and over and single, more options for them disappear,"" Hoshibata continued. ""For a divorced couple, it's hard for either of them to come back to church. The church needs to serve those needs also.""


Hoshibata and Harada plan future workshops to cover other concerns of single people, including stress management, single parenting and writing wills.


Norton is planning a research project to determine why the outmarriage rate among Sansei is so high.


""It's kind of startling to read the prophecy that, fairly soon, there will be no pure Nikkei,"" she said. ""That's alarming and worth looking into. There's a lot of statistics, but there is no reason offered as to why. I'd like to know why.""

The Wall Street Journal noted the aspirations of Asian Pacific Americans and their differences from other minority groups in an article headlined, ""Asian-American Political Muscle"" on Dec. 27.


Noting the growth of the Asian Pacific populations in the U.S. as well as projected growth in the next quarter century, the paper asserted that APAs are just now beginning to flex their political muscle, especially in such cases as:


Michael Woo's election to the Los, Angeles City Council last year;


Thomas Hsieh's ""good chance"" to win a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors this year;


Irene Natividad's election in 1985 as president of the National Women's Political Caucus;


Tiep D. Nguyen's possible candidacy for Congress in San Jose this year.


Asian Americans ""have become a force in campaign financing in the past 10 years, giving money far out of proportion to their numbers,"" the paper noted. ""As an ethnic group, Asians rank second only to Jews as contributors to the Democratic Party. Now they want to turn money into power.""


Landy Eng, head of the Bay Area Committee and chairman of the Asian Business League of San Francisco, acknowledged Asians' pocketbook power but complained that ""we cancel each other out because we give to all candidates.""


Both major political parties are hoping to channel that Asian American money into tighter channels, preferrably their own.


The paper reported that Republicans are appealing to Asian Americans ""as middle-class Americans -- small-business men, professionals and engineers -- with conservative family values and a strong tradition of self-help. Democrats still cast Asian Americans as members of a minority group needing special protection from discrimination.""


The Democratic Party scrapped its Asian Pacific Caucus last year as part of a stated attempt to shed its ""special interest"" image. Party Chairman Paul Kirk has proposed a new National Asian Pacific Federation to organize and motivate APAs in electoral affairs.


But the tone of the Wall Street Journal article suggested the Republican approach might win out over the Democrats:


""Programs designed to help low-income poorly educated minority groups don't make much sense for a minority group that boasts a higher median family income than whites, lower rates of unemployment and a higher percentage of college graduates,"" the paper asserted.

For several weeks now, I've been telling you about the different employment and training programs and services that our agency is responsible for. All of these programs and services have one common objective; putting people to work.


Although thousands of Washington residents have benefited from using our employment and training services, there is still the unfortunate reality of unemployment to deal with, and that's why we're here. While unemployment is inevitably a time for worry and a certain amount of grief, it is also a time for reflection, change and growth.


Unemployment steals our self-respect, damages the quality of our lives, changes our personal relationships, and undermines our faith in society, our friends, and ourselves. It's a crisis that can't be fully understood until you experience it personally. As it continues, your situation worsens, and the more important it becomes that you somehow learn to cope.


Your situation is not unique, as it is a problem shared by millions of others who are unemployed. Many of those cases are not as critical as yours, and others are worse. Your situation is not static. If you persist in your search for work, you will find a job. How well you cope in the meantime will depend on the quality of your attitudes, feelings, and actions; and you have the ability to control these.


Let's talk about those feelings.


You'll be angry, and you have every right to be. You want to work, but you don't have a job; and chances are you're not even sure at whom to direct your anger. There is a great deal of energy behind anger that can be put to positive use. That same enenergy can stimulate your imagination and put some innovation in your search for work.


You'll feel isolated, which can result from being angry. Sometimes we keep to ourselves out of a misguided concern for others, in that we're afraid our presence is depressing; or because we want to avoid making others feel uncomfortable. The key word here is ""misguided."" Your friends, family, neighbors, and contacts are more important than they've ever been, and you need their help and support.


You might experience a loss of identity. After asking your name, they want to know what you do for a living. When you were working, that was easy, but now, what do you say? This situation won't be so painful if you prepare a response. Without hesitation, look them straight in the eye and say, ""I'm a very good mechanic and I'm looking for a job."" Or, ""I used to be a secretary, but I'm looking for something in sales."" Don't be at a loss for words or apologetic about your situation. Instead, seize the moment to promote your job search.


Other feelings may include depression, paranoia, loss of self-esteem, and even fatigue. Again, you have the ability to control these feelings, and we are here to help. Once you have things in perspective, develop a plan of action.


Take the first step and visit your nearest Employment Security Job Service Center. Our trained professional staff will work with you to generate a plan to help cope with your situation and pursue new opportunities; that's why we're here. Make it an opportunity to evaluate where you've been and where you're headed, and determine whether or not you should change course.


We are the agency that puts people to work, and we're very proud and serious about that.

SAN JOSE -- College campus walls are suddenly being attractively decorated with Amy Woo's picture as she appears on the cover of the recently released ""Made In America"" Calendar of beautiful Asian young women.


Amy appeared with her sister. Margie Woo, Miss San Francisco Chinatown of 1983, in the 1984 ""Asian Women in California"" calendar as her first public exposure print-wise, but since then has been much in the limelight.


Her newest venture is joining the bevy of beauties who will be competing in the Miss Chinatown USA Pageant in February, sponsored by Peter Chan of Mountain Savings Bank (in organization) of Mt. View and Raymond Chan, Selective Arts Production Co. President.


""I never seriously considered running in the competition because I thought I would never have the time from my studies. The highest priority in my life has always been to finish my education and to continue on with my career, but I just received my acceptance to the University of Pacific Dental School, so I have a reprieve from school until my class begins in July,"" Woo said.


Woo has always been a very active young lady in her Sunnyvale community. In high school she was a member of the Grand Nationals winning Fremont High Drill Team, besides modeling for Chinese cultural club fashion shows wearing Yang Designs and Eliza Wang creations. She has graced the pages of Fashions 'N Fashions Magazine wearing Jean Marc designs, and also appeared in benefit fashion shows for Chi Am Circle and Sunnyvale Community Services.


Excitement reigns in the Woo household with Amy's upcoming pageant participation. Sister Margie said, ""I'm already feeling nervous for her because I know what hard work goes into preparing for the competition but I am glad she is competing because I feel being a part of this Chinese Chamber of Commerce Pageant enabled me to learn more about my own cultural heritage.""


""I'm lucky to have my sister's experience to help me. In fact, it was when I accompanied her to the Orient on her Miss Chinatown tour and met the Vice Mayor of Taipei that I first thought of competing. The Vice Mayor said to me upon our leaving. 'Now I hope you will come back to visit as us Miss Chinatown too next year.""


Howard Woo, Amy's father, originally from China and educated in Georgia, said of his two daughters, ""We feel it is very important to give the girls family support in whatever they attempt."" Mother Wahnita, whom Amy credits as being her hardest working supporter, added. ""I will always think of Amy as just my little baby girl, but we have tried, as she has grown up, to help her by giving her many options in learning how to make her own decisions regarding her activities and directions.""


In return. Amy expressed family pride: ""I know how fortunate I have been to have parents who have let me have so many experiences in my 21 years. I realize what a difficult adjustment they had to make as young immigrants to a new country, and I'm proud of what my grandparents and parents have achieved.""


Statuesque at 5'7"", Amy admits to being excited about the pageant.


Woo will be making her first personal appearance as a Miss Chinatown USA candidate in the Chinese New Year Festival to be held Feb. 1 in downtown Mountain View, sponsored by the Mt. View Central Businessman's Association and the Peninsula Lodge of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance. Amy. along with her sister Margie, Miss S.F. Chinatown 1983, will be waving to the crowds at the afternoon Parade along with other local dignitaries and celebrities.

So, you're saying to yourself ""Hmm..... this Chinatown Run sounds interesting but I'm too old for it"" or maybe you're saying ""I don't think so, I'm not the running type.""


Well, sorry to say, but if you've got an excuse like that, you better get ready to put on a pair of running shoes and be part of the annual Chinatown Run . . . because this run is for everyone.


""Anyone and everyone should get into the act!"" exclaims Alan Wong, Executive Director of the Chinatown YMCA. ""If you're a . . . runner, you'll find the Chinatown Run a very pleasant . . . challenging run.


""But don't worry about having to be a world class runner to . . . People young and old, . . . or out of shape run or even . . . the course.""


Herb Lee of the Police Athletic league echoes Wong's anthusiasm, ""There's no excuse . . . you not to participate. Last year, I saw a person in his seventies beat out runners half his age.""


Every year, people of different faces, ages, sex and physical make up, turn out for this community event that helps fund the Chinatown YMCA.


""It's for fun, not competition,"" says Jeanne Yee, health expert and annual runner, ""Take the course at your own pace. It's good exercise and a friendly way to bring in the Year of the Tiger.""


Lee has seen many different and sometimes very unique participants.


""One time there was a six year old girl running with her family. A few runs before that, one man officially entered himself and his dog into the run and they both finished the course."" says Lee.


Compared to the fast paced and crowded Bay to Breakers or San Francisco Marathon, the Chinatown Run is an alternative for the person who wants a more relaxed outing.


""The C-town Run is smaller . . . of the bigger runs but that's good. There aren't any rude people like there are at the Bay to Breakers or SF Marathon. It's just an enjoyable run that you can even bring your kids to."" says Yee.


People from all over the Bay Area come out for the annual event. The majority of the runners are regulars.


""I see people that have run this thing for the last five or six years."" says Wong. You get a good feeling from all the different people out there. Young, old, Asian or non-Asian -- everyone is just having a good time.""


Not even bad weather keeps these die-hard fun seekers from having a good time and helping the community.


""I'd say over 80% of the registrants come out even if it is raining. But when the sun is out you really better watch out,"" says Wong.


Though the Chinatown Run gets a wide range of participants, it doesn't seem to attract as many Asians as one might expect.


""A little more than half of the runners are non-Asian. I've got to stress that this run is aimed at getting Chinatown community participation."" said Wong.


Herb Lee wants to see all of Chinatown involved with the Run.


""I want to see the people of Chinatown and Asians from all over the Bay Area come out for this year's run. We need to get involved with our community.""


Most of the runners, both Asian and non-Asian, are between the ages of 20 and 35. There are also a lot of middle-age and senior runners. Wong feels that there aren't enough Asian teenagers, especially the youth of Chinatown, who know about the Run..


""I feel the key is to get more of the Asian jr. high and highschool kids in the city to come down and have some fun. It's very important for young adults to keep in touch with their community -- their roots.""


Wong thinks this is the year that a majority of the runners will be Asian.


""The Chinatown YMCA has been going out to junior highs and high schools where the Asian population is high to get the kids to come out for the festivities. I feel this year that a lot of them will,"" adds Wong.


The Chinatown Run has been, and still is, a very special tradition for the Chinatown community.


""This is the only run that's meant for the people of Chinatown. It's one of the only runs where Asians are such a major portion of the runners,"" says Jeanne Yee, who is also an ESL teacher.


""The Chinatown Run is such great fun and is a wonderful way for the Chinatown and Asian community as a whole to get together,"" she adds.


When you do finish the run, there are refreshments, oranges, and of course, the much talked about and prized Chinatown Run T-shirt.


""That's what gets a lot of the runners out of the house and onto the streets. They come for a friendly get-together, a pleasant run and the Chinese New Year T-shirt,"" says Wong.


""I just love it. It's got the Chinese New Year logo and it has Chinese characters on it .... not too many shirts have that. It's specially designed and really unique.""


The runners are broken into one of eight age categories -- the 15 and under group, 16 to 19, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69 and the 70 and over elite. The men and women have their own groupings. That's a total of 16 running divisions. The top three runners from each division are awarded medals.


The entry fee is $8.00. Race day entry fee is $12.00. Register early to avoid any hassles. For more information call the YMCA at 415-982-4412.

NEW YORK -- Gov. Mario Cuomo called Asian Americans the ""emerging force"" in American politics and urged them to set up networks to exert their growing influence to its maximum potential.


Cuomo, considered a strong contender for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, gave the keynote speech last Saturday night before the Organization of Chinese Americans.


The OCA held its 8th Biennial Convention here last weekend, with about 400 delegates in attendance. The group has 6000 members in 35 chapters in cities throughout the country, and is affiliated also with the Organization of Chinese American Women, according to executive director Henry Mui.


Lt. Gov. S. B. Woo of Delaware addressed the convention, calling on Chinese Americans to maintain their emphasis on education for their children but to also ask them to consider studying liberal arts and political science besides the technical fields of math and science.


A number of Chinese American elected and appointed officials from throughout the country joined in a panel discussion of whether an Asian American could be elected President of the U.S. in the foreseeable future. ""We are a long way from electing an Asian American President,"" Mui said in a telephone interview.


Dr. S. Andrew Chen, president of OCA called on members to not only register to vote but also go to the polls at every election.


There was discussion of the formation of a Chinese American political action committee, but no concrete plans have been made.


""We are stressing to our members that Chinese American candidates for public office cannot afford to be viewed as just ethnic candidates. They must appeal to a broad cross-section of society in order to win elections,"" Mui said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The public's eye is on this year's election for the Board of Supervisors here. But the behind-the-scenes power brokers in Chinatown are already looking ahead to the wide-open race for mayor in 1987.


The opening salvo was fired last week when about 40 prominent Chinatown leaders attended a $500-a-plate dinner for John Molinari, president of the Board of Supervisors and a strong candidate for mayor. Receiving $20,000 for his campaign chest this long before he has declared his candidacy is bound to highlight Molinari's contention that he is ""Chinatown's supervisor,"" a concept he hopes will steer other potential candidates away from the district.


But Assemblyman Art Agnos, also a potential candidate, is fighting hard for the favor of the Chinese American community, and popular Supervisor Louise Renne stands as a possible middle-of-the-road alternative between them.


Lines are already being drawn in the battle for Chinatown, a neighborhood which does not provide many actual votes but is considered a gold mine for campaign funding.


Supervisor John Molinari


Born and raised in North Beach, the predominantly Italian American neighborhood adjacent to Chinatown, Molinari represented Chinatown when supervisors were elected by district instead of at large. He has built up a large number of close friends in Chinatown over the years.


Dr. Dennis Wong, one of Molinari's friends, said the supervisor was ""instrumental"" in winning construction of the Mei Lun Yuen senior housing complex in Chinatown, and has helped on a wide range of other local projects.


Molinari also recently prorposed legislation to construct the Pineview senior housing complex above the Broadway Tunnel in Chinatown.


Molinari won applause last week when he promised to appoint a Chinese American to fill his vacancy on the board if he is elected mayor.


Chinatown leaders remarked that Molinari has been making more appearances than ever in Chinatown in the past year. He attended an art exhibition at Victory Hall, the headquarters of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, and even suggested that the exhibit should be mounted in the Rotunda at City Hall. He has also put in appearances at casino nights and other fundralsers for community organizations.


While Molinari has been supportive of business interests in Chinatown, leaders also credit him with trying to obtain a new park for youngsters in the neighborhood.


Assemblyman Art Agnos


When Chinese immigrants here heard the story of now Agnos' mother cried when she saw her son's face on a campaign poster on a bus going past her on the street, many of the Chinese mothers cried too. The story filled them with hope; if the son of a Greek immigrant can be elected to the California Assembly, then there is no reason the son of a Chinese immigrant can't be elected someday too.


Agnos, then is like a son to the Chinese. Agnos has courted the Chinese American community since he was an aide to former Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy.


He helped get funds and clearance to build a new wing at the Chinese Hospital, one of Chinatown's greatest institutions.


Agnos supported a proposal to expand St. Mary's Park in Chinatown to provide more open space.


Agnos won passage of legislation giving funds to build an exhibit about the Chinese railroad laborers, to be included at the railroad museum in Sacramento. He also helped obtain $88,000 to renovate the Chew Kee Store in rural Fiddletown, and to make it a state park and historical site.


Agnos has also received good publicity in the Chinese American community for his support of local agencies. When the Chinese Newcomers Service Center was threatened with the loss of two bilingual workers from the state's Employment Development Department, Agnos was instrumental in preventing the workers' transfer. When the Wu Yee childcare center was losing its liability insurance, Agnos won a two-week extension of the policy to give the agency time to shop for another.


Agnos has been outspoken in his support of environmentalists fighting highrise development in Chinatown.


Supervisor Louise Renne


As chair for the past five years of the Board of Supervisors' Finance Committee, Renne has been in a strong position to make friends in all segments of Chinatown society.


Quite simply, every program in Chinatown which has won city funding needed some degree of help from Renne.


Renne has especially been helpful in obtaining funds for programs for senior citizens and youth in Chinatown. She has worked hard to find new open space and parks for the area and was active in initiating the alleyway beautification projects here.


Renne surprised political observers in her last election. One of six supervisors vying for reelection in November 1984, she won the second highest number of votes despite the fact that other candidates spent hundreds of thousands of dollars more than her on their campaigns.


Especially important in Chinatown is Renne's image. she is seen as an honest, efficient and capable legislator, A friend of both conservative factions such as the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. and more liberal neighborhood groups. Renne may be able to capture the middle-of-the-road segment of Chinatown.


Renne is close to Mayor Dianne Feinstein, and that could be essential.


Hot Race


All in all, a tough battle is already shaping up in Chinatown over an election which won't be decided for a year and nine months.


Many members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce are leaning toward Agnos with their support With his liberal stances on development issues. Agnos might also be expected to win the backing of numerous neighborhood groups.


Board members of the CCBA are close to Feinstein and her opinion is likely to have substantial influence on the choosing of her successor in the mayor's office.


Both Renne and Molinari are close allies of Feinstein's In the final analysis, it may be the mayor who decides who will get the most Chinatown support to become the new mayor.

Here, east of the Cascades, there are two kinds of pioneers. One is of the past, in history both recorded and unrecorded. The other Asian American pioneer of the eastern Washington frontier is the newcomer, whether a Vietnamese American family settling in Spokane and opening a grocery, or a sansei from elsewhere wanting to get involved with Asian American affairs at Washington State University. My wife, Gail Nomura, and I are among the latter.


This is a long, long way from the Hawaii town of Aiea where both Gail and I grew up. But for a while, my life was a longer stretch away from my grandparents and parents' farm than it is now. At Amherst College, Massachusetts, I woke up in a world where people at least in one sense talked with me as though my own words mattered. Yet there I saw myself being educated further and further away from my roots.


After Amherst College, I taught at Doshisha University in Kyoto and traveled in Southeast Asia until I got stranded on a tiny Indonesian island. There, I realized what all sansei must experience and appreciate: that I am not a Japanese, but an American. A year later at Columbia University, I felt it time to take my master's degree and return home. I thought of myself as teaching other young islanders about the world. When I did so, I found, in three years of teaching at the University of Hawaii, that my life was now filled with unrelated things, and that was the fun of it.


I taught English courses, lived on our watercress farm, went deep sea fishing with my father whenever I had the time, traveled through Europe and the Soviet Union on several occasions, continued serious practice of aikido, specialized in Renaissance English literature, tested our spring water for forms of nitrogen, and continually debated politics and philosophies as was the nature of American life of those times.


I went to the University of Washington in 1973 to resume doctoral studies. In 1975, when Garrett Hongo and Sam Solberg in Asian American Studies asked me to coordinate the Pacific Northwest Asian American Writers' Conference, my life changed -- or else went on a long journey back to where my heart and mind were aimed in the first place.


After the 1976 writers' conference, I returned to Hawaii and the University. I thought I was returning home to make a life of it. For two years, a group of us, calling ourselves Talk Story, Inc., organized another writers' conference, an Asian American and multi-cultural Hawaii one that appeared in such unexpected places as the NY Times and the LA Times, but made a lasting difference first of all in Hawaii, where we wanted our work to count.


With the Talk Story conferences, first in 1978 and then in one form or another for three subsequent years. I thought the many voices of my life came together. For one thing, the literature spoke of people, settings and values that united our studies with whatever ""the community"" meant to us. For another, the Hawaiian Renaissance was directly comparable with the European Renaissance in the issues that gave life to both. I thought it possible at last to be both a Hawaii-born sansei, university professor of literature and a member of a local farming and fishing community, in one and the same life.


The idea turned out not to be wrong, but merely superficial. Back in Hawaii, I felt the shores ringing me in. I moved back to the big land of the Northwest and worked on my dissertation on Hawaii's literature in the UW English Department. Even though the University of Hawaii had a Ph.D. program in English, it seemed then that a study such as mine would have had difficulty being accepted. A kind of colonial norm there still dictated that the best, central literature of Hawaii is written by great visiting writers -- Twain, Stevenson, London, and even the one many locals view with most antipathy, Michener.


I was writing especially about local writers instead, whose names may be mostly unfamiliar precisely because of the colonialism that turns tongues to iron -- Native Hawaiian traditions of poetry, and authors such as Samuel Kamakau, King David Kalakaua, Queen Liliuokalani, James Chun, Gladys Li, Phil Ige, Shelley Ota, O. A. Bushnell, Kazuo Miyamoto, Patsy Saiki, John Dominis Holt, Milton Murayama, Darrell Lum, Eric Chock, and Virgilio Felipe. The strangulation I felt in Hawaii was in direct proportion to the success of our efforts on behalf of Hawaii's own voices.


But the University of Washington and especially my advisor, Professor Robert Stevick, the department's former chairman and still the Old English expert, encouraged me. One year I was awarded a fellowship that recognized the value of my subject in the humanities. Likewise, at WSU now I get to teach and continually research courses in Hawaii's cultures -- as well as Asian American courses of national scope -- that are at best sporadically offered in Hawaii itself. When I was writing in Seattle and Pullman, about Hawaii's literatures, friends in Hawaii would say that it seems to take this distance to make it possible to study Hawaii, or else the politics back home would choke the scholar and scholarship literally to death.


In February of 1981, Gail and I drove through the worst snowstorm of the season from Seattle to Pullman to see about jobs at WSU. In Spokane, Denny Yasuhara, a leader of the Japanese American community who made Asian American Studies at WSU possible by suing the university for discrimination, pointed out something he, as a lifelong Nisei pioneer of Idaho and eastern Washington, had given much thought to. It's one thing to have Asian American studies in a coastal city and a large university where you can count on drawing enrollments from a large number of Asian American students. But it's another thing to teach and work here, where our audience cannot be merely the four or five hundred Asian Americans on campus, but must be the fifteen or sixteen thousand others who need most to learn something from and about us and therefore about our country. Unless we can show how Asian American studies matter here, at the border of Idaho and all points east, Asian American studies will remain a ""minority"" concern, for a ""minority"" audience, confined to that same 100 mile strip of Pacific coastline that marked the World War II evacuation of Japanese Americans. Yasuhara explicitly called his home, the Palouse or Inland Empire, a ""frontier.""


Our Asian/Pacific American Studies Program at Washington State University is the easternmost in the nation. Denny and Thelma Yasuhara, Sam and Yoshiko Nakagawa, Richard and Michiko Sakai, Harry and Ada Honda, and other good people of the Spokane community did most, probably, to persuade Gail and I to come here to teach as the first established faculty of the program, once the university and community decided that they wanted us both. We settled here to live in the late summer of 1981.


We soon found a more extensive community still, beginning with the Palouse Asian American Association and the legacies and descendents of some of the historical pioneers. Among the legacies is this: James Wong Howe immigrated from China to Pasco, Washington in 1904 as a child. According to his youngest sister, Julie Howe Lee, who has run a store near our campus since the early '30s with her husband Don, James Wong Howe went to Hollywood to make his fortune sometime after their father was swindled by a lawyer who moved to Pasco from back east. The lawyer agreed to buy land in his name for the immigrant Wong Howe, ineligible to buy land in this state. On his own in Hollywood, James Wong Howe learned and pioneered the film art and industry from the ground up. This Chinese American whiz from Pasco eventually won two Academy Awards for his cinematography -- for ""The Rose Tattoo"" (1956) and ""Hud"" (1963).


Another legacy, this one nearly forgotten because of the Japanese American evacuation which reached as far east as Yakima, is the cultural life of the Issei settlers. I soon came to understand the cultural background of Momoko Iko's drama, ""The Gold Watch,"" set in Wapato, Yakima Valley, 1941-42, although Iko does not specify the place in her script. Masu Murakami, the character I had played in 1977 with the Asian Exclusion Act in Seattle, belonged to a senryu club, where Issei caroused and wrote satirical 17-syllable poems, like haiku except about people rather than about nature. In the early 1900s, two young Issei, Dontsuku Ueno and Kaho Honda turned from haiku writing -- perhaps because they were sick and tired of writing the same sagebrush haiku of Yakima over and over again -- to writing senryu, which was more fun, more sociable out there in the Yakima frontier that some Issei were quick to joke sounded like yakiuma, the ""burning horse"" or rather ""barbecued horse"" frontier. It was a natural desert but with agricultural potential to these people of wit, determination, and vision. So Ueno and Honda formed a club, which Momoko Iko's father and her drama's hero joined. These people of the Yakima Valley, according to Kazuo Ito in his great volume, ""Issei,"" were the founders of North American senryu, many samples of which enliven Ito's book:


All my harvest


Rejected in the market.


Great disappointment!


-- Dontsuku


""...and early to rise...""


No matter how early, though,


It don't make me rich!


-- Koyo


All my living days


Gripped tightly and pressed into


That old hoe handle!


-- Horai


Pioneers! That means


Those who sowed, and left reaping


To sons and grandsons.


-- Toshiko


Say, Grandma, old girl!


How we struggled all those days!


Who would believe it?


-- Nyozan


From there, Yakima's Issei art spread down the west coast and to New York City and elsewhere. In other words, Yakima was once noted among Issei for a certain valued contribution to their new culture in America.


In Yakima, too, Gail and I met and worked with old timers and younger members of the Filipino American community whose pioneers included the many migrants, like Carlos Bulosan, who knew the land and its people painfully well and could not stay there to settle.


But people such as Roy Baldoz did settle in Yakima, and it is thanks to him and his fellow pioneers that Yakima has a far more diverse ethnic heritage than we would assume from a distance. As a youth, Baldoz emigrated from the Philippines to Wenatchee to complete his high school education, with the goal of going on to WSU and a career in engineering. At WSU in the early '30s, there was a proud and impressive Filipino students' organization group of 30 or 40 members, including Baldoz. But the Depression discouraged him and some of his brothers from staying in school. They farmed and organized a fruit and produce co-op in Yakima instead, where, as the Japanese had learned earlier, the anti-alien land laws still contained loopholes on account of the farmed land being on the Yakima Indian Reservation, outside the jurisdiction of state law.


Today, pioneering in eastern Washington for Asian American newcomers and old timers alike involves ""making our own."" In ""Gold Watch,"" Masu scolds his Nisei son, ""Make your own!"" when the boy wants a $15 pair of football shoes. There are the usual Chinese restaurants and even a Filipino one here in Pullman and the neighboring cities of Moscow and Lewiston, Idaho. But there is virtually no Japanese food except at home or an hour-and-a-half away in Spokane, too far even for us, used to long distances, to drive just to eat one meal.


We easterners are the ones you Seattle folks see loading not one, but several shopping carts at Uwajimaya, our cars waiting outside already full of stuff for the six-hour haul between the borders and months between supply trips. We are the ones you see wandering around the International District and hurrying to Asian restaurants with that look of wild people who come hungering down from the mountains. We are the ones who, on rare occasions, may be seen with one or a dozen students grouped in the Nippon Kan to devour a show, all of us looking like kids on a field trip.


""Make your own"" means that we have to put on all our own Asian American cultural events. With the help of grants from within and from outside the University, we -- our Asian/Pacific American Studies Program, the Asian/Pacific American Students' Committee, the Palouse Asian American Association, the Spokane Japanese American Citizens' League, and other co-sponsors -- have been offering what is probably the most extensive series of programs of visiting speakers, artists, writers, films, and other Asian/Pacific American cultural events anywhere in the country, since 1981. Here we cannot rely on catching some event off campus, for there simply is none. There is no Northwest Asian American Theatre here, which means I don't act any longer or see certain plays locally except when we make our own drama workshops with the help of artists such as Frank Chin or Marilyn Tokuda. Lacking the environment of a city, we have created an Asian American cultural life on campus and have averaged more than one major speaker or program per month. Our visitors have included Frank Chin, N.V.M. Gonzalez, Momoko Iko, Patsy T. Mink, Alan Chong Lau, Bienvenido Santos, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gordon Hirabayashi, Tritia Toyota, Lonny Kaneko, Chan Is Missing, Velina Houston, Darrell H.Y. Lum, Wakako Yamauchi, Marilyn Tokuda, Larry Kauanoe Kimura, Shawn Wong, Cathy Song, James Mitsui, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, and dozens more, before audiences of up to seven hundred.


""Make your own"" means that we also make our own curriculum. With only two faculty members, whose appointments are split (me with English, Gail with History), our staffing for courses is severely limited. Yet we have a curriculum enabling us to rotate our teaching among courses ranging from multidisciplinary studies of Asian American communities of the American west, to graduate courses in American Studies which include Asian American subject matter. In between are our history and literature courses, including my upper level course in Hawaii/Pacific American Literature, offered regularly nowhere else in the world.


So we get supplies from the outside, as even pioneers must do -- supplies of food and visitors. But while the miles separate me now from the places of my past, I do not find myself comparing this place with others for what is lacking. It is strange that it has taken my coming to this Washington frontier to provide such opportunities as working on an advisory committee for something called agriculture and liberal arts, an institutional term for what in part we had rigged up in Talk Story back in Hawaii. It is somehow not very far from where I wanted my life to be after all, not only with respect to my education and work, but also to my origins.

LOS ANGELES -- The Chinese Clergy and Religious Association In North America and American Catholic Chinese Lay People Association held their annual conventions recently at Sacred Heart Retreat House in Alhambra. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to go there with five lay people and a sister to attend both of them.


The main focus for Chinese Clergy and Religious Association was ""How to encourage the Chinese lay people to participate in the work of evangelization?""


The theme for American Catholic Chinese Lay People Association was ""Getting up from table, removing the outer garment and taking a towel, wrapping it round the waist, and acting."" (John 13, 4)


The important topics for the Clergy Association were: Pastoral Psychology, Social Work Presentation, Spiritual Life of Children, the Needs of our Chinese Apostolate, Cooperation Between Clergy and Lay People, Church in Mainland China, Report on Questionnaire issued by National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and Possibility of Establishing A National Apostolate Center.


Topics for discussion for the Lay People Association included the sharing of faith, experiences and difficulties among various congregations; discussions and summaries of present problems; cooperation with the clergy and religious; election of officers; and the structure of the association and the various responsibilities of its office holders.


The important personages attending the convention were Coadjutor-Bishop Joseph Ti-Kang who is in charge of the Lay People Association of the Bishops' Conference in Taiwan; Rev. Paul Pang OFM, who is general director of the Office for the Promotion of Overseas Chinese Apostolate; Rev. Tomasi, representative of National Conference of Catholic Bishops of United States; and Most Rev. Roger M. Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles.


The members of Chinese Clergy and Religious Association came from all parts of America and Coadjutor-Bishop Joseph Ti-Kang and Sister Chiang came from Taiwan. The representatives of the Lay People Association came from New York, New Jersey, Boston, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Fresno, San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles.


Altogether there were over eighty people attending these two conventions.


Most Reverend Roger M. Mahony, Archbishop of the Diocese of Los Angeles, celebrated a solemn mass and gave a homily before over 300 parishioners. This mass was special in that during the ceremony there was an item for the congregation to honor their ancestors and all the martyrs in China. At the right side of the altar there was a tablet for ancestors and another one for the martyrs. On the head of the ancestors tablet on a piece of redwood were four Chinese characters which, when translated, said that the virtues of ancestors shine always. On both sides of the tablet there were two couplets stressing the importance of honoring ancestors both in spring and summer, of obeying the teaching of ancestors of admiring the filial piety and kindness of ancestors, and praying for the prosperity of the posterity.


These tables were brought to Los Angeles from Taiwan by Sister Chiang specifically for this occasion. The arrangement of these tablets on the altar and the preparation of other related matters were done under the personal direction of Coadjutor-Bishop Ti-Kang before the mass. When the clergy walked into the church in a procession at the start of the solemn mass, each of them held a cense, and in approaching the altar, they bowed in pairs to the tablets to show their honor to the ancestors and martyrs, and then put the censes in the censer. All this process conveyed a deep sense of reverence.


Miracles and Graces


When the representatives of the Lay People Association met, one reported that many years ago he contracted a strange stomach disease. He was allergic to all kinds of food and even to water. He suffered severe diarrhea. He had been treated by many doctors but without avail. Then he made a real effort to pray fervently for God's blessing. After he had thus prayed for a long time, he one day suddenly heard Jesus telling him that he would be able to eat any kind of food the next day. Surely enough, when he woke up the next morning, he felt that his stomach disorder had left him, and could take in food as usual. Afterward he was baptized and his stomach has functioned normally since then.


Another representative described how he survived three car accidents, and in one of them his car was wrecked completely. He asserted that this was definitely God's gift to him that he could come out safely from all these accidents.


When talking about his family life, a representative told the congregation about his experience. Some years ago he married a Catholic girl. At first because of difference of character, they found it difficult to live together. Afterward they prayed for the guidance of the Holy Spirit. They began to use methods of self and mutual examinations, and found out the weaknesses of each other. At last they could conquer their difficulties and lead a harmonious and happy life together. They then took a further step, and shared the experiences and feelings they got from their own actual circumstances, with other couples so that they also could solve their problems and let a happy family life. They are now serving as family counselors in their parish.


I wish to mention here two interesting incidents I observed during these five days of gathering together. On the head of the table which was put all the three meals for the day was placed conspicuously a Chinese painting. It was changed every day, one day a bamboo painting, another the portrait of the Blessed Mother, etc. After inquiry I discovered that all those pictures were done by a Caucasian Carmelite Sister who was one of the cooks. It is admirable that she has the interest to learn the technique of Chinese painting, and, in the meantime, has contrived to serve some Chinese food such as fried rice, spring roll, and broiled chicken for the enjoyment of the Chinese visitors.


At the end of the lunch party the Head of the Retreat House announced that a Chinese girl has been accepted by the Carmelite Convent as a novice, and that she will begin her novitiate at the end of this year.

It's late September, 1985. Five men are gathered around an old, wooden table. Each one is throwing ideas at the other. On some points, there seems to be a strong concensus. Other ideas fall to the ground.


The process is a grueling one, and the meeting does not end until well after night fall. The strategists do not waver from their task, however, and as the meeting adjourns, each makes room in his calendar for the next meeting two weeks later.


From these unlikely beginnings the event known as the Chinatown Run will emerge almost half a year later.


The task is monumental. Five major organizations coordinate their resources. A number of additional agencies act as run sponsors, and nearly 100 volunteers all must work together to make the Chinatown Run a success.


""You want to know what it takes to put the run together?"" says Alan Wong, run coordinator. ""It's a lot more work than you probably think.""


""We're looking for volunteers up until just one week before the run takes place, because there is just so much work to do,"" he says.


The run is above all, a community event, organizers emphasize. From conception to organization to finish, the Chinatown Run is supported by the community. All proceeds from the run are also returned to the community through the Chinatown YMCA.


In addition to the YMCA, the main organizations working to put on the run are the Asian Runners Club, the Police Activities League, the Winning Team, and Asian Week. Together these 5 groups form a sterling example of team work at its best.


The work begins as the Asian Runners Club and the Winning Team finalize the run course. The route must be scenic and the proper distance. It must also avoid heavy traffic and construction areas, while at the same time be easy for the police to keep under control.


The finalized route will begin at Sacramento and Grant, then head out of Chinatown via Grant Avenue, down to the North Beach area, around the Embarcadero, passing Fisherman's Wharf and the Pier, and then back into Chinatown via the Washington Hill.


After the route has been finalized, the actual work for laying out the course still remains. 350 orange pylon cones must be placed around the Embarcadero at 6 a.m. on race day, and then must be retrieved when the run is completed.


Maps of the route must be printed and distributed to all the coordinating agencies. Additional maps are distributed for publicity purposes. The police must also be informed of the route and possible problems that might arise.


At the same time, thousands and thousands of flyers are passed out to attract more runners. Primary targets are high schools, colleges, and universities. In addition, flyers are passed out to various running organizations and numerous community agencies.


Once the registration forms start coming in, each runner will be able to pick up a race packet including maps, registration numbers and miscellaneous information about the run. Later, organizers will also coordinate the passing out of T-shirts and the setting up of refreshment stands.


""Coordinating the passing out of all the materials - the sheer logistics of the task - it's mind-boggling,"" says Sergeant Herb Lee of the Police Activites League. Lee feels registration to be the single biggest task in the run.


""Getting volunteers to funnel their energies is also very difficult,"" he says. ""Getting all the volunteers out at 6 a.m. is hard. Luckily, 90 percent of them do show up.""


For Paul Oerth of the Winning Team, however, the most difficult task of all is ""keeping track of the runners at the maniacal finish line.


""At one point in the race, runners will be crossing the finish line at a rate exceeding one person every five seconds,"" exclaims Oerth.


Once each runner crosses the finish line, the keeper records the time on the proambulator by hitting a little red button. Afterwards, the runner must enter one of four chutes (4 different lines), and a volunteer at the end of each chute tears off the bottom of the runner's entry tag.


The runner's number is then fed into the computer and her unidentified finishing time is matched with her entry number. Keeping the runners in perfect finishing order is, of course, very important. Unfortunately, it is also extremely complicated.


To help solve this problem, most of the work is handled by a sophisticated computer system with custom-made programs. In 1981, with about 500 runners, race results were not posted until more than one hour after the race was finished. With an anticipated turnout this year of 2,000 runners, the tabulating time should be less than one quarter of that.


""If you don't get the picture yet,"" says Wong, ""let me spell it out for you: We need all the help we can get!


""If you can't actually come down to run, then come down to help us set up. We need volunteers. The Chinatown Run really depends on people to make it a success.""

SAN JOSE -- ""I have never made anything of being Filipino,"" said Lloyd La Cuesta, South Bay bureau chief and reporter with KTVU Channel 2. Having a Spanish surname, looking somewhat Hawaiian and a little Japanese, La Cuesta coasted along in life with few people ever questioning his ethnic origin.


It was not until he was seen on television on his coverage of ""What the Philippines is All About,"" that the public became aware of his identity.


""When many of the Filipinos in the community discovered that I was one of their brothers, they were surprised, but they were also very proud that a Filipino made it in the American broadcasting system. Now I am being recognized as someone younger who has made it in the white man's world.""


When La Cuesta went to the Philippines for the first time, he found his roots. Like most children of immigrant parents, La Cuesta was told much about his . . . but it did not have much meaning to him at the time.


""My parents taught me things like how to respect my elders by the way I addressed them, the Philippine language, which I seldom spoke, and of course I enjoyed the food my mother had learned to cook from the old country. But I took this to be just a part of my daily existence,"" said La Cuesta.


""However, when I was standing on Philippine soil and met my uncles, aunts and cousins, it dawned or me that this was where all things began for me, and suddenly I could relate.""


La Cuesta's parents had migrated to the Hawaiian Islands at different times and they met there. La Cuesta was born in Hawaii, and later his family moved to Los Angeles.


""I always liked to read and write, and I won many essay contests in school. I took journalism classes in high school and became editor of the school paper.""


While in high school La Cuesta had his first taste of newspaper work when he went to work for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner as a copy boy. Later he attended California State University at Los Angeles and had opportunities to write for the college paper.


Halfway through his education he decided that broadcasting work was more interesting to him. He transferred to San Jose State University and majored in radio and TV. At the school he became editor of the school paper and also did a daily TV show and a weekly radio program. Many of his classmates are now famous newscasters like Valerie Coleman Isabel Duron and Sylvia Chase.


La Cuesta was accepted into UCLA for graduate work in journalism but in 1969 he was drafted and had to delay his studies. While in the service though, La Cuesta was sent to Korea where he worked for the American Force Korean Network and did the radio and TV news for the station.


After his release from the service the veteran newscaster returned to UCLA and obtained a MA in Journalism. He then went to work for KABC-TV in Los Angeles, an ABC-owned station, where he became the producer of a news show. He later transferred to KTVU in the Bay Area and worked as a producer for weekend news programs, and he was a reporter for three days during the week.


Never afraid to make suggestions, La Cuesta proposed that Channel 2 open a news bureau in San Jose. His suggestion was well taken and he became the South Bay Bureau Chief and reporter for the station.


In the latter part of 1985, when the Philippine political crisis boiled to a head, La Cuesta wrote a memo suggesting that the station be ready to do some big stories in that country. He forecasted then that the hottest news in 1986 would be the Philippine crisis.


In the memo he suggested that Channel 2 send a reporter to cover a story on ""The Philippine Connection."" This suggestion won him the opportunity of doing a big story from overseas.


In January of this year La Cuesta stepped foot on Philippine soil for the first time in his life, and this has proven to be one of the better experiences of his life, he said.


While he was there, he had a chance to talk to former President Ferdinand Marcos personally. He also watched as this frail old man, who looked as though he was about to collapse any moment, would rise before a cheering crowd.


""Seeing his supporters seemed to have done something marvelous for Marcos,"" noted La Cuesta. ""When he got up to talk before the crowd for two to three hours, he was able to mesmerize his audience with his speech."" In moving among the crowd, though, La Cuesta discovered that many were paid 95 to attend the rally.


As for Manila, things were very different there than out in the countryside. ""The city did not look like a city undergoing a revolution like the ones we hear about in other places in the world like Latin America, noted La Cuesta. ""There were no visible signs of fear, and people were not afraid to speak their mind.""


La Cuesta was able to compare the city to the countryside when he gained permission to go by Huey helicopter to visit one of the small . . . in the Bicol Province. What he saw there was a subtle form of warfare.


The village he visited had about 2,000 people and the peasants were carrying guns. ""They carry on in their own lifestyle, but both the New Peoples' Army -- communist insurgents -- and the government troops were fighting to gain their loyalty"" La Cuesta said.


La Cuesta noted that the New Peoples' Army came into being with only a few in number. ""Now,"" he said, ""according to military sources, it has mushroomed to about 15,000 or more and it is growing at a rate of 20 percent every year. Ten percent of this army is composed of hardcore communists and the rest are nationalists or just plain thrill-seekers who like to hold a gun.""


When the NPA had control of a village, La Cuesta learned that the rebels would tax the villagers and also serve as their judge, jury and executioner. However, both the NPA and the government army used fear and intimidation tactics to get their way.


La Cuesta feels that the greatest challenge facing the Corazon Aquino government would be to win the loyalty of the peasants in the countryside.


As for the American-Philippine relationship, La Cuesta feels that the two countries have been walking on a tightrope. Although the Philippine enjoy a close relationship with the U.S., they do not enjoy being the little brown brother under the patronage of America.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Not many political exiles are given the chance to see once more the country they loved but left behind because of their beliefs.


However, the lot of Filipinos who have sought refuge in America has been given the privilege of going home en masse.


Ever since the toppling of the Marcos regime by ""people power,"" many Filipino refugees have joined the ""Freedom Flights"" that have taken hundreds of exiles back to their homeland.


Two of the first Freedom Flyers were Juan ""Johnny"" Quijano, once the most celebrated lawyer of mediamen in the Philippines, and Juan Frivaldo, former governor of Sorsogon, a province just south of Manila.


Before the Philippines Free Press publisher Teodoro Locsin Sr., and some of his staff writers were arrested and his paper shut down upon declaration of martial law in September 1972, Quijano was in Taipei defending his most controversial clients, the Yuyitung brothers, publishers of the Manila based Chinese Commercial News. The Yuyitung brothers were critics of the Marcos government and had been expelled from the country on charges of subversion. By the time the trial was over, Quijano was advised by friends and family to head for the U.S. because there were orders for his arrest.


Quijano lived in isolation for the past 14 years in California. Except for an occasional visit from his wife who still lived in Manila, the retired lawyer did not see much of his family.


He had been unable to obtain a Philippine passport, being blacklisted by the Marcos government, but minutes after Aquino sympathizers took over the San Francisco consulate, Quijano was the first applicant for a passport under the new government.


During the send-off at San Francisco International Airport, Asian Week asked how Quijano felt about going home to his family in the Philippines.


""I am definitely excited,"" beamed the former exile.


""My wife sold our old house six-years ago and moved to a new home, so I don't even know where they live,"" said Quijano minutes before boarding. ""Nevertheless, the most important thing is that I will finally see my own country again -- after 14 years.""


The despedida (farewell party), incidentally, was not just for Quijano. Another political exile and friend was to be on the same flight. Juan Frivaldo, who served undefeated as governor of Sorsogon for 18 years, was just as ecstatic about the trip. He has not seen his family for nine years, except for one daughter who joined him here.


Would Frivaldo try to get back into Philippine politics?


""Eighteen years of serving as governor is enough for an old man like me. All I can think of right now is my family whom I have not seen for nine years,"" Frivaldo said.


Another ""exile"" has taken the Freedom Flight. But unlike some of her fellow refugees, her story has a twist to it. Marie Pruden, better known in Manila media circles as Marie Castillo, has not been home for more than 10 years. She missed seeing her children grow from tiny tots to adolescents and spent years wondering whether she could still see them again.


Castillo was one of the more aggressive female writers who has carved her own niche in Philippine journalism. By the early 1970s she had her own colujmn in the Philippines Daily Express after being a staff reporter for the defunct Manila Times for years.


Her life took a turning point when she was assigned to cover the International Women's Conference in Mexico, which was also attended by Imelda Marcos.


Castillo had reportedly written something in her column which did not please Mrs. Marcos, and she was ordered by the latter to report to her upon return to Manila. Rumors spread like wild fire that Mrs. Marcos was out to teach Marie Castillo a lesson, and in the midst of all the confusion and wondering what she could have possibly done wrong, the journalist consulted with authorities from Manila. She was advised by Franciso Tatad, former Minister of Public Information who later moved to the opposition camp, that it was not a good time for her to come home. As time went by, it became difficult for her to renew her Philippine passport as she was blacklisted by the Marcos government.


Homeless and alone in California, Castillo survived the first few years of her stay in America by taking on odds jobs -- from being a housekeeper for the rock group Blood, Sweat and Tears to being a skipper's helper in a fishing expedition. Her only reason for survival and source of her faith was the thought of being with her children once more, some time in the distant future.


Her long years of suffering and uncertainty slowly came to a halt when she married a childless British immigrant, Miles Pruden, who expressed joy at the prospect of having children, and the eventual change of government in Manila which would open doors to homesick exiles.


The only thing she expressed before Marie Pruden headed to home was excitement and joy at the thought of being with her children again.


It is ironic that the very people who prevented the likes of Pruden, Quijano and Frivaldo from seeing their country and loved ones are now themselves exiles -- homeless and unwanted in their own homeland. The feeling of uncertainty has just changed hands.

A Special Relationship with a Sea Anemone


Dr. Gordon Chan, 56, marine biologist at the College of Marin, does not think highly of seafood in soups.


For more than 3 decades Chan has been concerned about the disappearance of many varieties of marine life at Duxbury Reef Reserve that have been threatened by poachers.


Duxbury Reef Reserve, near Bolinas in California, is one of the largest and richest intertidal reefs along the Pacific Coast.


According to Chan, marine poaching has increased because America has seen a change in diet from red meat to seafood, with black turban snails and sea anemone becoming the victims for the dinner table.


Although Chan believes that the disappearance of such marine life endangers the reef's entire ecosystem, he has a personal friendship with a particular sea anemone he named Tony.


""I have a relationship with a sea anemone that is almost unheard of. He knows when I stick my hand in the water. It's been a good relationship,"" he said in an interview with D'Arcy Fallon of the San Francisco Examiner.


Through the hard efforts of Chan, the 1971 state invertebrate Law was set up to protect all animals lacking a backbone or internal skeleton. Chan also helped to establish the Pt. Reyes Headlands Reserve and the Estero De Limantour Reserve.

While in Stockton, Choy will work in the accounting department of IBM Data Processing, a job she hopes will help when she returns to work for Peat, Marwick and Mitchell accounting firm in Los Angeles.


On Her Own


Susan Sakamoto of L.A.'s Best Photo Copier Service was recently profiled in the Asian Business Association's news-letter.


Sakamoto started her own business venture with her partner Robert Seaton in September 1985 and they have managed to provide copy service and supplies to a growing clientele in the Los Angeles area.


Sakamoto, a graduate of UCLA, has enjoyed running her own business.


""The biggest advantage to being in the driver's seat is that at least the efforts that I put into this are going towards building something,"" she said.


Through her experience in teaching, Sakamoto has learned how to communicate with her employees, a skill which she finds helpful as a business owner and manager.


""I hate people who talk down to you or talk above you. It's important to understand the difference between that and talking to someone at their level when you communicate with employees and clients,"" she said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco claims to have the largest number of important Chinese Song and Yuan period lacquers (10th to 14th centuries) in an American museum.


Thirty-five of these exquisitely decorate or carved lacquer bowls, trays, boxes, screens and tables are highlighted in ""Marvels of Medieval China: Those Lustrous Song and Yuan Lacquers."" These lacquers, which reflect in decor and form the artistic tastes of the newly prominent scholar-literati class, will be on exhibition through July 29.


Objects in the show are among the most elegant and subtle in the long history of Chinese lacquers and have been selected for their historic interest and artistic value. Although lacquer craft existed in China from the 4th millenium B.C., it was during the Song period (A.D. 960-1279) that lacquer forms reached new heights of elegance and simplicity. Techniques used during this time were elaborated on in the succeeding Yuan period (A.D. 1279-1368), which then developed some of the most exciting innovations in the decoration of lacquers.


With the rise of the literati class in medieval China came a greater demand for lacquerware objects associated with the lifestyle of this new elite. Techniques became increasingly complex and resulted in visually sumptuous embellishments. Superb examples of these forms and their decoration are included in the exhibition.


The most simple method of decoration was the coating of bamboo or wooden cores with glossy black, brown or brownishred lacquer. An object lacquered this way could then be painted with gold, as was an unusual low table with gold floral designs, on display in the show. Gold was additionally used for engraving of lacquer surfaces. Delicate designs were produced by filling tiny holes pricked in the dry lacquer surface with gold leaf or powder. The thin, fine gold lines on a small tray exemplify the mastery of this technique in the Yuan period.


A circular covered box carved with dragons moving fluidly amidst cloud scrolls illustrates another technique, that of applying layers of lacquer, sometimes of different colors, then carving through some of the layers to create a design in deep relief. A modification of this method, using only red cinnabar layers, became the most popular in the 14th century, and continued, up to the present, to dominate production.


Other objects were decorated with mother-of-pearl inlaid to create detailed pictorial styles. A black lacquer screen for a scholar's table, decorated with an intricate scene of a wind-swept scholar standing in a landscape, is an outstanding example of shell-inlaid lacquer.


""Luctrous Lacquers of Asia,"" an international symposium on Chinese lacquers, will be held on Friday, April 25 and Saturday, April 26 in the Trustees, Auditorium of the Asian Art Museum, Golden Gate Park, in conjunction with the exhibition. Distinguished speakers include internationally renowned scholars such as Prof, William Watson, former director of the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art, University of London; Dr. Jan Wirgin, director, Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm; Dr. James Watt, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and Dr. Yasuhiro Nishioka, curator, Tokyo National Museum. Sponsored by the Society for Asian Art, the symposium is open to the public. Tickets cost $75. For more information call (415) 387-5675.

NEW YORK -- The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration has increased the efforts of a special task force focusing soley on Chinese drug traffickers who police say are now dominating the multi-billion-dollar heroin industry in New York.


Group 41 of the FDEA has been assigned to break up the Chinese drug rings that transport heroin along ""the China White Trail.""


The trail originates in the mountains of Thailand, winds its way through the secret criminal societies of Hong Kong and ends in the Chinese neighborhoods of Queens, said a recent three part report in the New York Times.


Not only is Group 41 attempting to put a halt to the drug trafficking through stateside undercover drug buys, but they also have a handful of agents working with Thailand police. Together they have mounted suprise raids against jungle heroin laboratories as well as attacks on armed heroin caravans.


Since last year, in New York, Group 41 has seized approximately 150 pounds of heroin and arrested at least 39 people involved in the drug trafficking.


It is estimated that 1200 tons of opium are produced yearly in the Golden Triangle region where the boarders of Thailand Burma and Laos meet.


In the last two years 14 laboratories in Thailand have been raided. In the process nine people were killed and 14 soldiers and chemists were arrested. More than 2000 pounds of heroin, opium and morphine were captured.

OAKLAND -- For 33 Vietnamiese refugees living in the Coliseum Gardens housing project life has hardly improved since they left their war-ravaged home country.


Drug dealers are waging a one-sided war against the refugees, making nightmares of their lives with burglaries, beatings bombings and other vandalism according to the San Francisco Examiner.


Tran Nhan, 33, said that the windows of his car had been repeatedly smashed and that the vehicle was eventually firebombed. His door is protected with five locks.


""Every night is something bad happen,"" he told the paper.


Thu Le, a 26-year old single mother of two, said after her VCR and TV were stolen that she would have to move.


In one of the most dramatic incidents, someone fossed a tear gas grenade into the window of the second-floor apartment of Nguyen Minh while he was away at work. His wife, Le four months pregnant, dropped their three children one by one to the ground and jumped after them to escape the fames, sustaining slight injuries.


Police say they were hardly aware of the problems at the housing project until they heard complaints about the tear gas fumes.


""We've had very few reports coming in from the . . . community indicating that they are being harassed. But were looking into what's happening now,"" said Chief William Smith who heads the 13 officer Housing Authority police force.


Fran said that security officers had told him they can do nothing, they say we must protect ourselves.""

QUITO, Ecuador -- Those wonderful shrimps which Asians enjoy eating may not be from the ocean floor, but from ponds located in Ecuador.


Aqua culture which is a name given to shrimps grown in ponds from larvae has been around for a long time. The Chinese and Japanese were the first to develop the process and since then, many other countries are growing shrimps this way.


Renee Kan lives in Ecuador and became involved in growing shrimps in a pond when a friend mentioned how lucrative the business can be. ""Many people were interested in getting into this type of business, but I guess I lucked out and now I am making good money.""


Kan is Chinese and speaks only Spanish. His father years ago traveled from China to Ecuador for a vacation, but decided to stay. He later entered the retail business and was quite successful.


Kan cannot tell how aqua culture became such a major industry in Ecuador, but he knows that there is a large Chinese population in the country and that somewhere along the way, perhaps a Chinese may have introduced aqua culture into the country.


Today shrimps raised in ponds are shipped frozen from Ecuador to different places in the world and the U.S. is one of their biggest buyers.


""Surprisingly over go 90 percent of our seafood is imported,"" said Mike Latachkie, general manager of a seafood brokerage firm, Pacific Harvest Seafoods in San Jose. ""Here in the U.S., there are few producers or harvesters of shrimps, and our major suppliers are Mexico and Ecuador. Others are the Philippines, Singapore, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.""


""In the last couple of years, however, there has been a huge influx of shrimps coming from the Far East,"" added Bill Jacobsen, who is the assistant to the general manager. ""Mexico was our principal supplier of our fresh water shrimps and Ecuador for pond-grown shrimps, but in recent years the shrimps from Mexico have gone down in quality. Not only that, but the demand for shrimps is worldwide, and Mexico was unable to meet all the demand. So different countries began looking elsewhere for their fish.


""At present,"" said Jacobsen, ""there is a world wide shortage of large size shrimps.""


The season for harvesting shrimps is over in Mexico until August, and those raised in ponds are smaller because those in aqua culture can grow smaller shrimps in less time and they can make more money from it.


Brokers purchase shrimps by the numbers one can get in a pound, said Jacobsen. The large shrimps are from 16-20 to as few as 10-12 in a pound. The smaller shrimps come 31-35 to 50-60 in a pound.


Consumers pay high prices for the shrimps, admitted Latachkie. They are paying $10-15 per pound. Because of all the cost involved in handling the commodity.


""Seafood consumption has increased by 35-40 percent in the U.S."" said Latachkie, and this has helped the industry tremendously. Americans were meat eaters, but now with the push from doctors to eat more fish because of its nutritional value,"" the seafood industry has dwarfed the meat industry.


""Also recent research studies have shown that eating seafood helps to lessen heart ailments, and many people have increased their consumption of fish for this reason,"" he added.

LOS ANGELES -- An Asian American businesswoman played a crucial role in unraveling one of the biggest scandals in city government here in years.


After reviewing an investigative panel report, Mayor Tom Bradley has asked the City Attorney's Office to prepare a list of formal charges on mismanagement and favoritism against the head of the city's General Services Department, Sylvia Cunliffe.


Bradley appointed Lilly V. Lee to a three-member panel in June in response to allegations that Cunliffe favored friends and relatives in the leasing of city-owned property and that she disclosed confidential personnel information in retaliation against an employee in her department who was critical of her actions.


As head of General Services, the city's fourth largest department, Cunliffe, 54, was in charge of over 1700 employees and a $127 million budget.


The department manages the city's fleet of vehicles, maintains its buildings and purchases its supplies.


The recently completed report was highly critical of Cunliffe. In it the investigative committee members discuss possible criminal and civil violations by the city administrator.


Lee is a prominent Chinatown civic leader and president of her own property management firm.


""I think he's (Bradley) following the intent of our report,"" she said. ""We had some very serious concerns.""


This is not Lee's first contribution to community service.


Lee was appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to serve on the board of directors of the California Economic Development Corporation. Sen. David Roberti appointed Lee to serve as a commissioner on the California State World Trade Commission.


She is also on the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce board of directors and the United Way's Corporate Board Executive Committee.

""Not too long ago, when the personal computer market was really hot, Televideo spent an all-time high of $20 million on television advertising,"" said Mardi Garren, the company's director of corporate information. ""However, when the market became saturated with personal computers and every man and his neighbor owned one, Televideo changed its marketing strategy and gradually eased out of television advertising. This has reduced the company's tremendous advertising costs considerably.""


Televideo no longer targets the general public but zeroes in on a more select market. ""The company is directing its advertising campaigns to distributors, end users, OEMs and value-added resellers, the company advertises in trade magazines, the Wall Street Journal and consumer business publications,"" Garren said.


""The chairman of Televideo is a firm believer in the effectiveness of advertising and he has consistently placed company ads before the public. He also takes a personal interest in directing the advertising goals of the company,"" Garren added.


Spending millions on advertising, companies like Televideo expect positive, angible results from their ad campaigns. But this does not always happen.


""Even with the best of conditions, ad campaigns can fail or come up short of expectations because of misdirected campaigns or uncontrollable outside influences,"" said Larry Fong, a 25-year veteran of the ad business and owner of the advertising firm Fong and Fong associates in San Jose.


""A good example of an uncontrollable outside influence would be during the time preceding the recent Super Bowl game,"" he said ""Both the 49ers and the New York . . . expended mega-dollars advertising . . . the come,' expecting to win their way . . . Super Bowl.""


. . . reported by David Alioto, director of . . . operations for the San Francisco . . . baseball team's retail outlets, . . . also sells merchandise from football . . . ""The 49ers dropped 50 percent in . . . of their merchandise after the Super . . . On the other hand, the Giants, the . . . team, went up by 100 percent. After the game people were in our stores immediately clamoring for Giants T-shirts, hats and jackets, and we did not have enough stock on hand to meet the demand.""


Fong pointed out, ""In this example the uncontrollable outside situation was which team would win the Super Bowl, and no one could predict the outcome.""


Although the results of the game had direct impact on sales of the teams' merchandise, advertising did help promote interest in the game. Millions of Americans sat in front of their televisions, forsaking all other activities to watch the event. Those who advertised during the game had a captive audience, but they paid exorbitant prices for the privilege.


No matter what an advertiser pays for an ad, noted Fong, there is no guarantee of increased sales.


""What advertising does, mainly, is to keep the name of a product and the place to buy it before a targeted audience. This does not mean that a customer will immediately buy. A consumer may buy only at the time he has a need for the product. The advertiser, then, is banking on the customer to remember his company's name when the need arises.""


To achieve good results, there are many factors to consider, such as themes, art work, copy, and demographic details on age, educational level, income and occupation of the targeted audience. It is also essential to target a particular audience; the advertiser should know whom he wants to reach.


Timing is another important element in successful advertising.


""Timing differs from one type of business to another,"" noted Fong. ""In the case of a retail store, for instance, success at the holiday periods is crucial. Another important time would be pay periods. Take a liquor store in a blue collar area. Most of the workers in this situation tend to have more money to spend on pay day than at other times. The liquor store therefore must advertise at this target period to earn maximum-returns on its ad expenditures.""


Fong finds that some of his innumerable clients have a clearer view of how to achieve their advertising goals than do others.


""These people have an understanding of ads that would appeal to their particular audience and they come up with some very interesting ideas,"" he said.


Advertising agencies are idea houses. ""They work to generate a new and different approach to promote their client's product, or to mount a successful political campaign or promote a community awareness program such as one dealing with AIDS,"" he said.


""Some agencies not only produce ideas but also produce the campaign 'in-house.' In our case we generate ideas, create supportive art work and copy, and produce finished art.


Being a perfectionist, Fong does much of his company's production work himself.

In Japan, traditional forms of theatre, such as Kabuki, Noh and Kyogen, have a very large and devoted following. It is common to see loyal theatre-goers line up for hours before the two o'clock matinee, clutching their bento lunches and zabuton pillows.


Avant-garde theatre, called Shigeki, also exists in Japan for a somewhat more artsy crowd.


It is a real pleasure and rarity that a play containing both traditional and contemporary elements can be presented. ""Make-up,"" a production that will be presented by the Group Theatre Company, is a play that combines elements of these styles.


Billed as a play in two acts for one actress, ""Make-up"" is a play within a play. Yoko is the director and principal actress of a traveling troupe. While putting on her make-up for the evening's performance, she recites her lines. She will play the role of a son searching for the mother who abandoned him at birth.


She begins to reflect on her life and how poverty forced her to abandon her own son. There is a knock at her dressing room door and a young man appears, insisting that he see her. At first she refuses, then she learns this young man was abandoned by his mother 20 years ago. Shocked and surprised, Yoko realizes this man must be her son.


He enters the dressing room and begins to tell his tale, which is the same story. Yoko is about to play on stage. Yoko loses her sanity and shouts at him to leave. It is time for her to go on stage and recreate her own painful journey of abandonment and search.


Misako Watanabe very skillfully plays all the roles in ""Make-up"". She has been active in drama since the early 50s and is considered one of the primary interpreters of the Japanese avant-garde in its ""golden era.""


""Make-up"" is written by Hisashi Inoue and will be performed in Japanese with supratitles in English. Performances will be at the Group Theatre, 3940 Brooklyn Ave NE. Showtimes are November 3 through November 7. It is suggested to call for reservations and ticket prices, as they vary with each performance. The box office phone number is 543-4327.

Indians coming from India are mostly of the educated class. They are scientists, doctors and engineers and they are here for better living and educational opportunities. America benefits from their skills. Indians also want to advance in the field of science and they are here to improve on what they already know.

Anyone should be allowed to go where they want to. There should be no border restrictions. People should go where they have the most opportunity to succeed. In this country, if we did not have immigrants, second and third generation children will not be able to move forward, because they are the group who are willing to do the menial work we are not willing to do.

Absolutely! Hoever, there should be some limitation to ensure a quality of life for everyone. Being married to an English immigrant, and I, myself, being a third generation Sansei, I feel that opportunities made possible for my husband and me should be made available to everyone.

Four businessmen connected with King Lung Commodities Company Ltd., a gold commodities firm in the International District, embezzled most of the $1 million to $1.2 million invested by local buyers, King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng has charged in court documents.


King Lung Commodities operated an office at 607 S. Jackson between August, 1982 and January, 1984. The trade organization also had offices in Vancouver, B.C. and Hong Kong, where the firm was headquartered.


When the Seattle office abruptly ceased operation in early January, it owed more than $120,000 to its investors. A three-year investigation has revealed that most of the approximately $1.2 million in investors' money was never used for legitimate trading.


Maleng has charged the four businessmen -- Mark Yuan Chow, Peter Lin-Heng Cheung, Stephen Tong and Tin On -- with securities fraud, first degree theft conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit first degree theft.


Chow has pleaded guilty to first degree theft, but he and Cheung, both Vancouver residents, also face criminal charges in British Columbia. Chow will be sentenced in June. Cheung is at-large and may have fled to Asia, according to Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Ivan Orton.


Tong and On will go on trial on July 13 in King County Superior Court.


During the period of its operation, the Seattle office of King Lung Commodities, called King Lung Seattle, recruited about 130 customers to invest a total of $1 million to $1.2 million in the Hong Kong and London gold markets. Investors were told that their money -- or ""margin deposits"" -- would be used to cover any potential trading losses.


These customers, lured by claims of low risk and high returns, each invested between $3,000 and $80,000. Most of the total amount of money invested, the Prosecutor's Office contends, was never invested, but was used for personal purposes and to maintain the office.


""This is embezzlement, where money is taken for one purpose and used for another,"" Orton said.


In December, 1983, King Lung Seattle notified customers that the office was closing and that they should withdraw any remaining margin money. At the same time, the larger Vancouver King Lung office also announced its closure.


In early January, 1984, the Seattle office closed with less than $3,000 in the bank. Records later revealed that King Lung Seattle owed more than $120,000 to 30 customers. None of King Lung's customers received their remaining margin money.


One week after King Lung Seattle closed its doors, police officers, armed with a search warrant, ""seized huge boxes of evidence,"" Orton said. And Seattle police, interviewing over 70 people, were able to compile enough evidence for the Prosecutor's Office to file charges in late December, 1986.


Within the past three years, local law enforcement officers steadily built their case against King Lung Seattle through documents seized in January, statements from Mark Chow, statements and documents from investors and former employees, and verification of bank records.


According to the Prosecutor's Office, King Lung Seattle was started in early 1982 by a Hong Kong organization called King Lung Gold Traders. Hong Kong residents Peter Yip, Carl Ching and Albert Lee -- and two Vancouver, B. C. residents, Peter Cheung and Mark Chow -- planned the creation of King Lung Seattle.


The start-up of the Seattle office was partially funded by a $25,000 loan from Edward T.C. Chan, owner of a funeral home in New York City. The Vancouver office also loaned approximately $15,000 for the start-up.


Chow recruited a Vancouver employee, Henry Vuong, to assist in selecting a site for the Seattle office. Tin On and Stephen Tong were hired to manage King Lung Seattle.


According to Chow, the Seattle office was initially a subsidiary of the Vancouver office, but later became independent and reported directly to Hong Kong, Cheung, along with Chow, oversaw the Seattle and Vancouver offices. Tin On, Henry Vuong and Stephen Tong managed the operations of the Seattle office.


King Lung sales representatives, who stated in police interviews that they were inexperienced and trained for as little as a few hours, enticed customers with literature stating that King Lung Commodities Ltd, was one of largest gold traders in the Far East and a member of numerous international commodity exchanges. It also claimed to be affiliated with the Continental King Lung Group, a multi-million dollar enterprise with offices in 22 cities.


According to court documents filed by the Prosecutor, customers were told:


-- King Lung provided a 24-hour research department to assist the customer and broker.


-- Customers could make money in both upward and downward trends.


-- Great profit potential existed because of low commissions.


-- Holdings could be liquidated on a moment's notice with payment by King Lung in three days.


-- Profit potential for King Lung's investment plan was 50 times greater than if gold was bought outright.


Only Chow and Cheung had check signing authority for the Seattle office, Chow stated. Chow said he sometimes questioned checks, but if he disapproved Cheung would override Chow's decision.


In October, 1982, Vuong, whose responsibility was to keep the books and monitor customer deficits and margin accounts, became suspicious of the Seattle operation when he noticed the short amount of time for telex transmissions to Hong Kong. Vuong was fired about a week later after he brought this fact up with his superiors.


In December, 1983, Tin On and Stephen Tong instructed their sales representatives to contact their clients and have them liquidate their accounts because of the need for an internal audit and transfer of accounts. Wayne Chin, office manager of King Lung Seattle, said Tong and On, who were leaving town, ignored his request to prepare withdrawal checks for customers.


Later that month, Chin contacted the bank and discovered that two King Lung Seattle bank accounts contained a total of approximately $2,800 Chin knew that his company owed in excess of $120,000 to customers withdrawing their investments.


On January 3, 1984, Chin arrived at work and found out that On and Tong were no longer available. On January 12, Chin called the Fraud Division of the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. The next day, based on information provided by Chin and Gene Closterman, an investor with King Lung, a search warrant was issued to obtain entry into the offices of King Lung Seattle.


Police investigators later discovered that, from August, 1982 to January, 1984, King Lung Seattle operated continuously in an insolvent condition and, almost from the start, used customers' margin funds for its own purposes. The investigation also revealed that there was never any transfer of funds to Hong Kong.


Chow said King Lung's sales representatives almost always practiced ""churning,"" where they would overtrade an account to generate commissions. The clients didn't stand a chance and would eventually lose all their money, Chow said.


He said it was also common for King Lung sales representatives to tell customers they were losing money on trades, when in fact, no trades ever took place -- an illegal process known in the commodities brokerage business as ""bucketing."" Chow said he had never seen any customers of King Lung in Seattle or Vancouver make money.


Peter Yip, of King Lung Gold Traders in Hong Kong, has denied that he, his organization, or his company's parent group, Continental King Lung, had ever provided promotional literature to King Lung Seattle. He also contends that the Seattle company was a separate legal entity from his organization, and that Tin On and Stephen Tong were never his employees. Yip also claimed that he has never been a director, officer or shareholder of King Lung in either Seattle or Vancouver, and that the use of the name, King Lung Commodities, as well as his own name, were unauthorized.


Employees of the San Francisco and New York offices of King Lung Commodities Ltd. have previously denied any connection with the King Lung offices in Seattle or Vancouver.

Contemporary Chinese Paintings, Davidson Galleries, 313 Occidental. Avenue South, through September 27


This quietly upbeat Pioneer Square exhibit joins new works by well-known contemporary Chinese painters with those of younger Chinese artists. The large size of some of these ink and watercolor pieces invites the viewer to step in and experience firsthand the freedom and wildness of nature -- a reflection of the newfound artistic freedom in the People's Republic of China in the 1980s.


Yet Yang Yanping's tranquil paintings remain quintessentially Oriental with their graceful brushstrokes, soft colors, and landscape and nature themes. Her use of black and white swaths of color create a curious batik effect, while a hint of warm color energizes Autumn Lotus, distinguishing it from her wintry scenes.


Some works are painted on rice paper which has been mounted on finely patterned silk of various hues; these hang in the gallery like huge scrolls. Here again is the beauty of the natural world: Narcissus by Wan Naizhuang; Wu Gwanzhang's Heavenly Pond, a large abstracted wash of blue; and another work entitled Lotus, this one by Zhang Zhizhong. The lotus, Chinese symbol of fruitfulness, grows in thick profusion all over the country; often waterways have to be cleared to allow even small boats to pass. It is no wonder that this luxuriant plant has long been found in Chinese art.


Sometimes nature's lushness overtakes the painting as in Wang Naizhuang's densely packed Floral. Here, a bird is surrounded by a thick jungle of flowers -- a surreal scene straight out of Henri Rousseau, and an example of a traditional theme stretched to artistic fantasy.


Other themes also emerge among these works. Ancient Profile, a haunting work by Wang Naizhuang, depicts a woman's face in all its three-dimensionality, as far removed from stylized figure drawings as one can imagine. The show includes two expressionist nudes by Wang Dalin.


Sometimes freedom of expression reveals itself through the titles of the paintings, as in the misty greys of Yang Yanping's Winter On Long Island, or Zhang Zhizhong's Lonely Craft, a peaceful evocation using only a few strokes of the brush.


The show also features new works by two younger artists. Zhao Baiwel creates tapestry constructions that resemble oversize baskets. The woven rice paper pieces, free-form and unconstrained, are decorated with painted calligraphy.


In contrast to the other artists represented, Zhang Boachi's medium is boldly colored tempera. His paintings, merging the real and surreal, would be right at home in any American gallery of contemporary art. Each work unveils a story waiting to be solved.


Romance, for instance, presents a couple about to witness a shark devour a vase of flowers at their window. Even the checkered floor is distorted in this scene.


In Kidnap, a man is apparently at the mercy of a large red bull, while the usual urban bystanders remain oblivious. A book entitled ""Kidnap"" is inexplicably part of the picture Symbolism and social commentary are left for the viewer to ponder. And therein lies the message of this group show which reveals new traditions created by numerous conscious and subconscious influences playing on individual artistic expression.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Most people who have come into contact with Chinatown here over the years have at least one thing in common: they all knew the late H.K. Wong.


Wong for decades was known as Chinatown's premier publicist. He was instrumental, for instance, in establishing the annual Chinese New Year festival, bringing thousands of tourists into Chinatown. He also helped build the Portsmouth Square parking garage, which made it possible for more visitors to see the district. And he sat on the board of the S.F. Convention & Visitors Bureau, assuring that Chinatown would figure into all The City's promotional campaigns.


At the time of his death two years ago Wong was putting the finishing touches on Gum Sahn Yun (Gold Mountain Men), a book about many of the historical Chinese American figures who stand out in California's early years, as well as many of the less-known residents of Chinatown and the state in the 20th century who helped build the thriving community that stands today.


H.K.'s widow Honey Wong and the Chinese Historical Society of America took over the book project, and the final product is being unveiled this Saturday at a CHSA party to be held at the Empress of China, 738 Grant Ave., 11:30 to 2 p.m. For information call 474-4454.


""What is different about this book is that many of the people featured are still alive,"" Mrs. Wong noted.


H.K. Wong's list of community activities covers just about everything that happened in and around Chinatown in the past 40 years. Aside from running a number of local businesses including the Ti-Sun Company Hardware & Furniture store, the Empress of China and the Polk Pacific Building Supply Co., he also served as a journalist for Chinese Digest, Chinese World, Asian Week East West, Chinatown News, Jade Magazine and Chinatown On Parade.


Wong founded the S.F. Chinese Tennis Club and was active in its annual tournament up to the time of his death at age 77.

(Editor's note: Millan is a 17-year-old Philippines native studying at Sweetwater High School in San Diego. Though his first language is Tagalog, he wrote this essay and read it before the California Assemby in support of Speaker Willie Brown's AB 37, which would extend bilingual education).


Tradition ... in the simplest of terms it is the handing down of the past to posterity. It is a vital aspect in life, one that forms strong relationships between those who share it. Many consider language to be a tradition. It is looked upon as the symbol of one's life, culture and heritage. Many hold fast to their language and would be hesitant to understand another. Yet to be bound by tradition is the way of the mindless and the enslaved. To be inspired by it to achieve further heights is the way of genius.


America is a country of many nationalities, a union of culture, ideas and philosophies. We live in a world shared by brothers, yet many tend to close their eyes and minds to their ways. One must realize that keeping an open mind is important for growth. Without it one would merely see according to limits formed by such restrictions, and a restricted mind is a wasted one. Many find it easier to follow paths already made instead of creating and exploring. They feel so safe and secure in knowing only their language that they tend to neglect those of others. To do this is to deny knowledge and to accept ignorance.


In American society there exist many barriers, obstacles of differences, whether physical or mental, of opinion or nationality. Ironically, it is this very same society that creates these barriers and holds within it the ability to overcome them.


To be bilingual is extremely necessary in the conquering of such barriers. In a bilingual society there would exist a common bond, something which allows one to associate with the other. It brings people a step closer to the acceptance of one another, something which could possibly result in the end of prejudice. It permits one to rise as limits may allow. Bilinguality may not insure material success, but its rewards are not measured in dollars and cents. It is prosperity of the mind.


Speaking another language is not the mere essence of bilinguality. Words mean nothing if there is no understanding behind them. Learning another language is not just an acquisition of new words, but an enlightenment of culture. Bilinguality isn't merely accepting and learning. It is understanding. Imagine the wonders that language could bring. Eyes would look out into a larger world and ears would hear and understand so much more. Language, given a chance, can do all this.


To be restricted by language is to deprive oneself of what America has to offer. Learning and understanding another language is the key to opportunity and true freedom. Language is knowledge, and the development of another language would not only be an improvement in American society, but a maturing of the world as a whole. The path towards bilinguality would be a betterment of life, not to mention a progress within oneself. We must all constantly strive to reach new heights and achieve greater goals. If bilinguality is essential in doing so ... then so be it.

OAKLAND -- The city last month crossed one more hurdle in its 20-year-old effort to develop three blocks of Chinatown when it approved general plans for a $30 million East Bay. Municipal Utilities District headquarters office building.


C&L Financial, the primary developer of the site, expected to sign a final agreement with the city within 30 days, and EBMUD hoped to break ground on its project this fall after a detailed new design could be completed.


Chinatown community leaders hailed the new EBMUD plan as a breakthrough. In accordance with community leaders' requests that EBMUD reduce the bulk of the 250,000 square foot building, the utility agreed to put all its parking underground.


""We're very pleased,"" with the new proposal, said Alan Yee, a lawyer for the community groups, who attacked an earlier EBMUD plan as a ""monstrosity.""


EBMUD project director Tom Tellefsen said putting three levels of parking underground instead of the original proposal of two levels underground and two levels in the building would result in a better building for EBMUD as well, so ""everyone wins.""


He and other community leaders earlier expressed impatience with C&L Financial which has not begun work on the project even though it was awarded the contract over a year ago and the city has a agreed to pay $2.5 million for the Asian culture center and loan. C&L $7 million at 10 percent deferred interest for 50 units of affordable housing which C&L agreed to build.


Lambert Li of C&L said the project had been delayed ""for many reasons,"" including EBMUD's negotiations with the community groups. He said C&L's purchase of the Hyatt Regency hotel nearby had nothing to do with the delays.


Yee argued that C&L could have begun other portions of the development even before the EBMUD design was finalized.


He said the final disposition and development agreement between C&L and the city would require the developer to post a $1 million bond or letter of credit which would be forfeited if C&L does not break gound within 18 months.


Beside the culture center, the affordable housing and the EBMUD building, plans for the project include 250 market-rate housing units and other undesignated commerical space.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Chinatown Resources Development Center, which uses the latest in computer equipment to train the disadvantaged in job skills, has picked IBM to receive its Private Partner Award, only the second time in 21 years the award has been given.


IBM is being recognized for its donations of computer equipment, cash grants, loaned executives and volunteers. The company recently made the largest corporate donation the center has ever received -- $260,155 worth of personal computers, printers and typewriters, according to a press release.


The job training agency, cited by the Bay Area Council as one of the 12 most effective in the Bay Area, will present the award at its annual fundraising event, Aug. 21, at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel, 55 Cyril Magnin St. Secretary of State March Fong Eu is honorary chairwoman of the event. The center, at 655 Geary, which serves all races and nationalities, helps students find employment after training.


Lee Bowman of San Francisco, vice president and area manager of IBM's South-West Marketing Division, will accept the award.


""Over the years IBM's generosity -- in terms of funding support, equipment donations and volunteer time -- has played a vital role in the center becoming an effective job-training resource,"" said Chui Tsang, center executive director.


Bowman, who coordinates IBM marketing activities in seven Western states, said, ""IBM believes in giving back to the communities where we live and work. We are pleased that we can help the Chinatown Resources Development Center produce the kind of graduates who become solid wage earners in San Francisco.""


Tsang said about 1500 students have graduated from the center's computer training courses since they were launched five years ago. More than 90 percent of those who took the free training found computer-related jobs, he said.


Susan Owyang, center employment director, said computer training is so popular that students asked that the center be open on Saturdays so they could obtain additional practice. ""Now the computers are going six days a week, 12 hours a day,"" she said.


In 1982 IBM donated the equipment the center needed to initiate computer training -- a System 34 computer and nine terminals. The next year the center expanded its computer training classes with an IBM donation of nine more terminals, six word processing machines, three IBM PCs and a copier.


In addition to the $250,155 worth of computer and typing equipment, the center this year also received a $25,000 IBM Summer Youth Employment Program. grant. It received a similar grant two years ago.


The new equipment, which replaces the much-used equipment donated in 1982 and 1983, consists of 20 IBM PC ATs, 10 IBM PC XTs, 30 printers and 20 IBM Selectric 3 typewriters. The computers are used to teach computer literacy, word processing, spreadsheet, database and computer-assisted English and math.


Two IBM-loaned employees have served as advisers to the computer training program since 1982. Under the IBM Community Service Assignment Program, employees remain on the IBM payroll while working full time for a community agency.


In addition to the loaned employees IBM volunteers have given a lot of off-duty time to the center.

SAN FRANCISCO -- In response to the overwhelming need for services with the advent of the legalization process under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Nihonmachi Legal Outreach along with the Asian American Bar Association will open an immigration clinic to assist the Asian/Pacific Islander community with applications under the amnesty program.


NLO is working with members of the Korean American Bar, the Filipino American Bar, and the Asian American Bar Associations to recruit and train a panel of volunteers to staff the clinic.


The first clinic will be held on Saturday, July 25, 1987. Assistance will be provided by appointment only. All services will be confidential.


This clinic will assist only those who wish to apply for amnesty. Under the new law, people can receive temporary residence status, and eventually permanent residence status if:


1. You have lived in the United States illegally since before Jan. 1, 1982, and


2. You have not left the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, except for brief absences, and

SAN FRANCISCO -- Mayoral candidate Art Agnos met with supporters in Japantown last Wednesday to address Asian American issues. The event, which was sponsored by the Japanese American Citizens League, attracted over 300 supporters.


Some of the issues Agnos responded to included anti-Asian violence, education, housing and civil rights.


Agnos said he shares a great respect for every individual's ethnic heritage and from that respect he believes comes a real understanding and openness to the issues facing Asian Americans.


David Nakayama of the JACL believes that the issues and concerns that Agnos brought up don't just effect the Asian community in San Francisco.


""What he says crosses the Asian communities but it affects the mainstream as well,"" said Nakayama.


Supporters believe Agnos stands out on several issues, including being the only candidate running for mayor who wants to expand rent control to cover vacant apartments and the only candidate who supported downtown growth limits and Proposition M last year.


Concerning civil rights, Agnos ""vehemently opposed the racist English-Only Initiative,"" Proposition 63 on November's state ballot, which passed overwhelmingly, as stated in his campain literature. Attorney Ed Lee of the Asian Law Caucus is impressed with Agnos on this point. ""He really helped on this and didn't wait to respond like some of them did. He wasn't afraid of taking a stand on the initiative and he gave it personal care -- and I see him consistently caring,"" said Lee.


Agnos also has people behind him that care. A number of those in attendance last week showed their care by signing up on committees to assist Agnos in his efforts to become San Francisco's next mayor. Rose Pak of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce stated that Agnos' signed-up supporters number roughly 500.


Last Saturday the Agnos supporters held a grand opening of their headquarters at 666 Mission St.

. . . the mayoral race in San . . . nears, another contest . . . up, this time among . . . supporters. Or, in the case of the Filipinos, between two candidates' rah-rah teams.


The story is that the Filipino American community has been cleaved by dissonant choices for mayor, narrowed down to Assemblyman Art Agnos and Supervisor John Molinari.


This early, the Agnos rooters have exhibited more muscle in their moves, pushing their candidate to the eye of most activities significant to the Filipinos, and getting maximum media mileage out of it.


On the other hand the Molinari backers, confident of their candidate's lead in funds and popularity, have not manifested their plan of action. At least, not yet, thereby accelerating the excitement among the rival teams and the political watchers in general.


In another predictable turn on Wednesday, Aug. 19, Art Agnos won the nod for official endorsement of the Filipino American Democratic Club. Agnos swept 84 out of 114 votes, or a whopping 73 percent. Molinari was way behind with 25, or 21 percent.


The special ballot took place in the historied Dimasalang House, in what FADC President Marivic Mabanag noted as her second meeting since she was instated last June to her post in yet another special poll to elect a successor to Board of Education appointee Roderick McLeod.


The FADC was reactivated last year with the election for president of McLeod. Mabanag was chosen vice president, and the third and fourth vice presidential seats went to San Francisco lawyer Cyrian Tabuena for external affairs and SF State University professor Dan Gonzales (internal affairs).


The FADC has become one of the most influential political organizations of the Filipino community, boasting of highly committed members from both the community's Old Guard and youngblood.


And as the evening wore on, it was clear that despite their common vision, predecessor and president did not share the same choice for mayor.


Mabanag has been visible in drumbeating sorties for Agnos, while McLeod has allied with the group batting for Molinari.


""We must demonstrate that we are a community not concerned with parochial needs but with the future of this city,"" Mabanag stressed. ""We should place ourselves in the corridors of City Hall but we cannot let our politicians do the work for us."" She warned of the labor at hand ""to support the candidate who best approximate the ideals and aspirations"" of the Filipinos.


Invited to the Candidates' Night were mayoral aspirants Louise Renne, John Molinari, Roger Boas and Art Agnos.


Renne was the first to arrive and by the time the candidates were to give their introductory address, only Renne and Molinari were on the panel.


Mabanag announced that she had issued a letter opening the polls at 7:30, closing at 9:00, with a possible extension.


No sooner had moderator Dan Gonzales reached the podium to open the forum when parliamentary procedure threatened to obstruct the exercise.


Disagreement over whether to allow the members to vote before having listened to all, including the tardy candidates, turned into an issue which was resolved by the timely arrival of lawyer Rodel Rodis. To change the timetable would be to suspend the bylaws of the club, refereed the San Francisco attorney. The matter consumed so much time but the early debate proved that the FADC deserves its name.


Louise Renne went over her work for civil rights so that ""minority business ordinance can stay in effect and achieve the empowerment"" often alluded to by Filipino leaders; basic city services, especially in the arena of the seniors, and education. She spoke of heaving been drawn to Asians ""when it was not popular,"" and that she nurtured a personal relationship with Asia because she has relatives who were born in that continent.


""I'm the one who supported an put through a program for Asian Americans. I've been with you in the past and I'll be with you in the future,"" she vowed. She received four votes that night.


John Molinari cited his support for bilingual education, and his disfavor of the immigration reform law among his pro-Filipino sentiments. Further, he said, as mayor of San Francisco he would appoint Filipinos to commissions and boards, and in management positions. ""That's a pledge,"" he said.


Molinari also vowed not to ""displace city employees . . . contracting outsiders."" He . . . heartily applauded by successful entrepreneurs Jess Esteva and Demetrio Jayme.


A break was called before Agnos took his turn before the energized crowd.


He began by saying that he could not possibly enumerate all the work he has done for them in the five minutes allotted to all candidates. He did mention, however, that the day before he voted for the approval of the Roberti bill that would ease the way for foreign-trained optometrists to take the state licensure exams.


Agnos promised affordable housing for all San Franciscans. He also gave his word to appoint Filipinos in key positions, just as he had tapped Anita Sanchez (now aide to Mayor Feinstein) to be on his administrative staff.


Many of the voters had left by the time Boas made his pitch. He wound up with a 0 in the ballot.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Dr. William L. Gee won a 1987 University of California at San Francisco Medal, one of four persons to be so honored, Asian Week has learned.


Dr. Gee, 73, was informed of his selection in a Feb. 12 letter from UCSF Chancellor Dr. Julius Krevans, who said the University Medal is ""our most prestigious award.""


Dr. Gee won a broad show of citywide support last year when he ran unsuccessfully for the Board of Supervisors. Placing a respectable ninth among two dozen candidates in the race for five seats on the board, Dr. Gee surprised political observers by garnering more votes than better known candidates.


According to the campaign biography he released last year, Dr. Gee earned his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from UCSF in 1951 under the GI Bill. For the next 35 years he practiced dentistry in Chinatown, serving also as a Public Health Dentist for 26 years and six years as a member of the board of directors of the S.F. Dental Society.


In 1979 he won the Phoebe Hearst Award from the S.F. Examiner as one of the 10 most distinguished citizens of The City. He has won a host of other community service awards.


Dr. Gee, one of the founders and still chairman of On Lok Senior Health Care Services, has served on the boards of numerous community agencies including United Way of the Bay Area.


On the national front he was appointed to the Technical Advisory Committee for planning of the White House Conference on Aging.


Before running for the Board of Supervisors, Dr. Gee served on the S.F. Commission of Aging and Adult Day Care Planning Committee.


The University Medal will be awarded to Dr. Gee on Thursday, April 9 at the Hotel Meridien. For information call 476-2401.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chinatown welcomed the U.S. Navy with open arms Wednesday night, and the Navy responded with a warm embrace.


Nearly 1000 people crowded into the Ocean City Restaurant to pay tribute to the Navy as it begins its Fleet Week celebration in San Francisco Bay. Hundreds of Asian American leaders got a chance to see senior naval officers up close and discuss the future of the Navy's presence in The City. The dinner was organized by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and Supervisor Tom Hsieh.


Homeporting of the battleship USS Missouri at San Francisco was the real topic of discussion, and the dinner's organizers left no doubt of their support.


Rear Admiral Robert Toney, chief of Bay Area naval operations, told Asian Week he was surprised at the high turnout at the dinner.


""This is overwhelming. I knew the Asian American community was generally supportive, but nothing like this,"" Toney said as he looked out over the crowd.


The proposal for homeporting the Missouri has been beset with controversy since its inception, with pacifists protesting the military presence, anti-nuclear activists protesting the battleship's weaponry, environmentalists protesting the ship's possible effects on marine life in the bay, small business advocates protesting the displacement of firms at Hunter's Point where the ship would be based, gay activists protesting the U.S. Navy's hiring practices, etc.


""Sometimes we get a bit depressed,"" Toney said in reference to the opposition to the ship, ""but it's great to know the Asian community here has welcomed us with open arms.""


The admiral echoed that refrain in his prepared remarks to the crowd.


""Life does ebb and flow. A few weeks ago we were booed and hissed and called everything but children of God. But your Board of Supervisors passed the Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Navy by a slim margin, with a vote of 6-5. And here tonight I find myself being hugged by the Chinese Rose Ball Queen,"" Toney said to cheers and laughter.


Hsieh was credited with delivering the crucial swing vote that passed the MOU.


""There had been a perception that San Francisco was unsure of whether it wanted the Missouri,"" Hsieh acknowledged in his short speech. ""But Asians are one-third of The City's population, and we want to have our say. We have got to let people in the House of Representatives and the . . . know that we want the Missouri homeported in San Francisco.""


Supervisor John Molinari, a candidate for mayor made a brief appearance at the dinner to express his support for the Missouri.


""You know, I've had fun in my campaign for mayor, telling voters I support the Missouri. I've enjoyed it because I'm the only major candidate who does support the Missouri,"" Molinari said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Tossing a 25-pound jar from edge-to-edge on top of a person's head or contorting one's body into the shape of a ball not only sounds amazing -- it is amazing.


Members of the Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe provided these amazing feats and more before near-capacity audiences at the Chinese Cultural Center last month. The exciting entertainment by the world-touring Shanghai Troupe was just one stop on the group's busy American Tour Performance schedule.


Over a dozen acts and routines including comedy were presented in two comendable performances. The only disappointment during one performance was the intrusively loud music that should have complemented the acts rather than compete with them.


Fortunately half-way through the performance the recorded music was toned down and the energy and momentum of the entertainment excelled.


One of the most exciting acts of the evening was the jar juggling act by Ding Weiping and Shen Weimin. Their intensity and daring put viewers on the edges of their chairs as they watched Weiping and Weimin toss a 25-pound jar from head to head. In complete concentration the jar was successfully transferred from each performer on its edge.


A graceful and beautiful act was performed by a team of women during ""Spinning Water Meteors."" The women spun by string, candle lit glasses in the dark while the light cast by the lit jars showed the women's shadow.


The audience focused on the contortion act when 11-year-old Xu Jing bent her body into the form of a double ""S"" and into the shape of a ball --backwards-- with knees against ears. The pretty, petite performer seemed to have the complete attention of the audience.


Barrel contortion performed by Xu Yue illustrated a great example of the tremedous flexibility and strenghth it takes to be an acrobat. Yue managed to wiggle her body in and out of a tall narrow container.


Da Liang and Cai Xuejin drew shrieks of laughter with their acrobatic slap stick routines which included each of them attempting to sit in the same chair. During their performance the comedy team made sitting in a chair seem like a great challenge.


The Shanghai Troupe is one of over 250 professional acrobatic, magic and circus troupes in the People's Republic of China. They are composed of an estimated 25,000 performers, trainers and artisians which present more than 200 different kinds of acrobatic skills.

Dear Carolyn,


Through sweat and tears I have gained entry to UC Berkeley and I have enrolled as a freshman student. Now it's not the academic courses that I'm concerned about, but it is the problem of finding a decent place to live.


I have worn out two pairs of shoes hunting for adequate shelter, but I'm competing with thousands of other students in the same predicament.


Short of camping out in People's Park and studying by, moonlight. I am open to suggestions?


Sincerely yours,


Homeless Genius


Dear Homeless Genius,


The Rent Control policy of Berkeley is a two edged sword. It benefits students by keeping rents low however, at the same time it harvests a brand new group of tenants who are actually graduates working in executive or mid-executive positions; but who still keep those same apartment units because of its low rent. Since there is such a shortage of living units in Berkeley, one solution would be to go back to the old time practice of students living with established families in Berkeley, exchanging services as a housekeeper, gardener, etc. for a room to live in. Another solution would be for some of the wealthier family associations to buy up the large apartment houses and rent them out to their own sons and daughters.


Dear Carolyn,


I have saved and planned for a long time to make this visit with my son and daughter-in-law. When I finally arrived at their large, beautiful home, I found that they had made reservations for me to stay at the Holiday Inn.


Now, if I had wanted to stay in the Holiday Inn, I could have stayed home and made a hotel reservation myself.


I am not an interfering mother-in-law. In fact, I usually cook all the meals, help with the housekeeping and baby-sit with my grandchildren. Do you think it is fair of my son and daughter-in-law to put me in a hotel?


Nuked from New York


Dear Nuked,


No, I do not think it was very gracious of your son and daughter-in-law to put you into the hotel. Although a Holiday Inn has fine dining and living accouterments, it is not the same as the warmth of a home. However, you did not state the length of your visit, your relationship with your daughter-in-law, and your personal habits.


Sometimes a hotel stay makes for a longer-lasting relationship. You will rate if you can better communicate.


Dear Carolyn


I'm a new subscriber to Asian Week, thanks to a gift from a loving sister. Up in Sonoma County where I live, the Chinese and other Asians seem not to congregate much as ethnic groups. So, I missed not reading about Chinese happenings.


Believe it or not, there is a club on our Santa Rosa Jr. College campus which I founded about two years ago. We currently run about 12-15 people in membership which includes both students and non-students. From time to time I teach Beginners and Advanced classes in old-styled mah jongg. People who join our club are given free ""starter lessons."" We play daily at noon in the school cafeteria and one evening a week at a Chinese restaurant.


I would like to get in touch with other groups in the Bay Area and elsewhere - groups that still play the ""original"" traditional Chinese-style mah jongg where each player's points count, not just the winner's points count.


Perhaps, if there are such groups out there, we can have some inter-city, inter-region tournaments and competition. Or, we can make a ""visitation.""


One feature of our club is that we have frequent tournaments with prizes for the first three high gross-ers, also high game. These contests, so far, have been on a ladder elimination style. Last year, one of our students who won first place was a Caucasian male.

SAN FRANCISCO -- ""Many Asians don't know how to flirt,"" asserts Joan Sakyo, president of the San Francisco Asian Singles Club.


On Saturday, July 25 ""dating coach"" Carolyn Kellams will work with a group of Asian Americans on ""Finding The Right Love"" and the fine art of flirting.


""We will look at your past relationships and analyze the patterns of interaction. From these, we will determine characteristics and qualities essential in your right love. Don't just settle for any relationship; make it the right one,"" encourages an announcement flyer.


Sakyo admits that Kellams has never addressed a group of Asians before and is working with her to tailor the session to their needs.


Kellams has been prepped to expect less feedback from an Asian audience than from a group of white participants and also to be aware of some of the cultural differences that affect social interaction.


""Asian women are taught to be passive. They are told flirting shows aggressiveness,"" said Sakyo. She added that ""A lot of flirting is done with the eyes. Asians don't make eye contact, they tend to look away.""


Sakyo became familiar with Kellams in a S.F. Chronicle article and latter attended several of her lectures.


Overall Sakyo anticipates that the session will be of great benefit to the participants.


""Finding The Right Love"" will be presented at the Japanese Cultural and Community Center, 1840 Sutter Stroet in San Francisco at 7:30 p.m. Socializing and dancing follow the lecture. Admission is $7 for members and $10 for non-members. Checks should be made out to S.F. Singles.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The incidence of AIDS is rising sharply among Asians, blacks and Hispanics, according to the Health Department which is targeting those populations with an informational campaign.


At a March 3 press conference San Francisco Health Director Dr. David Werdegar and other City officials disclosed charts detailing the impact of AIDS on the various ethnic groups, including the following information:


The number of AIDS diagnoses among Asians and Pacific Islanders has climbed steeply from zero in 1981 to one in 1982 and 1983, four in 1984, 14 in 1985 and 18 in 1986. Already by Feb. 28 this year three more cases had been diagnosed in that population.


Last year 1.7 percent of the AIDS diagnoses were for Asians or Pacific Islanders.


Of the male Pacific and Asian AIDS victims four are between 20 and 29 years of age, 23 are between 30 and 39, nine are between 40 and 49, two are between 50 and 59 and one is over 59. There are only two female Asian or Pacific AIDS victims in The City, both between 40 and 49 years of age.


Thirty-five of these cases are homosexual or bisexual non-intravenous drug users, two are heterosexual intravenous drug users, two are homosexual or bisexual intravenous drug users and two are transfusion recipients.

A professional union of business expertise and experience is destined to make a success out of Victor Jin and Judith Ong's San Francisco/Bay Area firm, Property Investment Services.


Three years ago, the young married couple sat down and took stock of their lives after Judith left a prestigious position as vice president of the mail order division for Victoria's Secret. Victor at that time was general manager of a mail services business. Although successful, he felt the need for a more challenging job.


The young San Francisco born and bred couple has been heavily involved in the founding of the Asian Business League, and through networking, met many ambitious entrepreneurs. This inspired them to find their own niche in the business world and to look at different areas of self-employment to pursue.


""We came upon the area of real estate investments and management because this business seemed to fit the parameters of our own needs. The business offered a good dollar return for hours demanded, took little capital to enter, and we both had an interest in real estate,"" said Victor at their Alameda office.


He recalled that it was a difficult decision to leave high income positions and go out on your own. However they found great satisfaction with the idea they would be independent to determine their own destiny.


""Especially appealing to me,"" added Judith, ""was the idea we would have sole control over the products and services we would render to our clients. That isn't possible working for others.""


Professional in manner and preparation, Victor and Judith took their time getting ready for the opening of their business, drawing on colleagues for advice and seminars for proper education in this particular field.


Victor became a licensed real estate broker; Judith joined Grubb & Ellis Property Management Division for real estate background. And together they developed their own business plan for operation.


To succeed in the business of real estate, they felt they needed to differentiate themselves from others in the field. Thus they began to develop a niche in a specialized area: property management.


""The property management profession has not always had a good connotation to its name, but we approach this field with a committed attitude and want to establish our company as one that does a highly professional job for the client. Our goal is to personalize our property management services and Judith works as she is representing herself, rather than the client,"" said Victor.


""Property management is basically, a simple operation, one that a successful manager should look at as a challenge rather than a headache as so many landlords consider it to be. In the beginning, using Judith's training and background, we applied that knowledge to our own properties and its management to gain practical experience. Today Judith heads the property management end of the business, and is very busy handling all the 'challenges' of landlord/tenant problems efficiently from her San Francisco and Alameda offices,"" Victor continued.


Potential clients often ask them about the values of a professional property manager.


Judith stressed that the good property manager will oversee the daily operation, provide preventive maintenance, and study the possibility of a greater return on the owner's investment. In particular she emphasized the need to develop a good landlord/tenant relationship so that everyone is satisfied and comfortable.


Some specifics on their list of services include timely collection of rent; screening of prospective tenants; preparation and execution of rental leases; processing of accounts receivable and payable; management of building maintenance and repairs; monthly and year-end financial status reports, scheduling of periodic building inspections; representation at rent board hearings and/or, evictions; and most importantly, 24 hour emergency service.


""Our service gives peace of mind to the owner. With our personalized service, my client reaps the satisfaction and financial rewards of property ownership without landlord headaches and responsibilities. Owners know their investment is managed by experienced property managers with proven expertise to manage the day-to-day operational details of property management,"" Judith added with a knowing smile.


Judith recalled her most memorable tenant experiences.


Once she received a telephone call in the middle of the night. It was from a tenant who was on the way to the hospital because the sheetrock from a water-soaked ceiling fell on him while he was sleeping in bed on a stormy night.


Another incident involved an irate tenant who had just been served with an eviction notice. The tenant began to chase the deliverer of the eviction notice with a 2"" by 4"" plank of wood. ""These instances alone,"" emphasized Judith, ""show how property managers can take the hassle out of property ownership for clients, don't you agree?""


Victor now devotes most of his energies to the commercial brokerage part of their company working exclusively with customers who want or have commercial properties.


This dual partnership of services provided by Judith, and Victor now can offer purchasing as well as property management. Victor believes that the two services go hand in hand.


""Not only can we represent the buyer of the property in the purchase, but can offer the service of managing it for the client. Then when the time comes when the client is ready to sell, who else would know the property's assets and values better than the company which has been handling it all along,"" said Victor.


A native San Franciscan, Victor admits to dropping out of high school and going to work as a bank clerk at age 17. Entering the service at 20, he spent 15 months in Taiwan, but upon return, became a full-time student at San Francisco City College while carrying a full time job in operations on the midnight shift for Crocker Bank.


Ironically by the time he graduated in 1975 from S.F. State University with a degree in business, specializing in personnel relations, he was already an operations manager in his after-school job managing over 150 employees. He continued his studies and received his MBA at Golden Gate University in 1978. By then, Victor had already become one of the founders and presidents of the Asian Business League and met Judith at one of the founding rember's initial meetings.


Both Victor and Judith are ambitious in their business pursuits. Their goal for Property Investment Services is to be recognized as a leader in the property management industry.


""There are not many Asians in the field and a matter of fact, we know of only one other Asian-owned property management firm at the present time,"" said Victor.


With the expansion and growth of their business, they hope to build a reputation for expertise in management by both owners and tenants.


For themselves personally, Judith said, ""We hope to someday establish our business to a stage where we can maintain the business and still have more time for family endeavors. Our goal is to be comfortable enough to have the freedom to spend time for pursuits of our own choices, whether it be for family, friends or the community.


The active young couple have a two-year-old son and both admit their own recreational pursuits have changed focus somewhat to become more family-oriented. They both love sports, however, and still find time for jogging, tennis, biking and skiing.


In addition both are continuing their heavy involvement in community organizations. Victor has been a Board member of the Chinese Community Housing Corp., a non-profit organization devoted to maintaining affordable housing for Asians. He is also on the board of the East Bay Asian Local Development Corp., chairperson of the housing and land use committee.


Judith is on the Board of Chinatown Resource Development Center which helps Asians with job training. This year she served as chairperson of the fundraising committee. She also is active with Charity Cultural Services Center which provides a training ground for immigrants in restaurant work.


Maintaining the professional goals they set out with, both agree that, above all, they believe in personal and professional service to their clients and tenants. They are proud to be the premier property management company whose reputation has been accomplished by offering and providing the personalized services required in property management.


Property Investment Services San Francisco main office is at 1847 Larkin Street. Both Judith Ong and Victor Jin can be reached at (415) 771-0550.

A friend, Lien Nguyen, kept reminding me to try Quoc Te, a Vietnamese restaurant on the border of Oakland Chinatown. Lien, full-time culinary student at Contra Costa College accompanied me to dinner and when we left two and a half hours later, she casually mentioned that she still had to make 300 egg rolls that evening. I'm grateful that Lien took the time from her busy schedule to introduce me to this gem of a restaurant.


Lai Tran owns Quoc Te. Her brother Dean is the manager and also waits on tables, giving diners helpful advice. Their parents also work in the restaurant, putting their talents to work behind the stove. The elder Trans first lived in South Vietnam, then later moved to the North and eventually made their way to the central part of the country. The Trans operated a restaurant in Vietnam before coming to the U.S. in 1980. Dean Tran explained that Quoc Te's diverse menu reflects the family's experience with the food of the different regions of Vietnam.

There are many sterling items on the menu and I selected seven which best display Quoc Te's talent in creating a symphony of flavors and textures.


Three delicious imperial rolls ($3.25) come with a battery of accompaniments which appear with many of the appetizers and grilled meat dishes. Half of each roll is placed in a lettuce leaf with thinly sliced carrot and cucumber, mint and cilantro leaves and rolled up. The crisp rolls also come with a little pile of boiled rice noodles to include in the bundle and with a tangy dipping sauce.


Chewy shrimp-pork salad rolls ($3.25) are wrapped in rice paper (not fried) and are filled with mint and basil in addition to pork and shrimp. These rolls are also rolled in lettuce and have a remarkable light and refreshing flavor.


A mound of chicken salad ($3.75) colored with shredded carrots, basil and cilantro and studded with peanuts is completed with a fiery dressing. Shrimp and pork salad ($5.50), very similar to the chicken salad, is delicious, with a pungent mint flavor.


One of my favorite dishes is the exceptional shrimp, pork and bean crepe ($3.75). Stuffed with a medley of shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts this fat, crunchy crepe barely resembles its soft French cousin. The crepe also comes with the lettuce entourage.


Another hit is a dish which curiously is called beef brochette with rice paper ($9.95) as there are no skewers used with the meat. Slices of beef, tomato and onion are cooked at your table on a portable burner and then are wrapped up in rice paper and then lettuce.


Call ahead to see if Vietnamese roast duck is available. If you are lucky you will be treated to tender flavorful duck served with a delectable garlic and ginger sauce.


Silver Medal Dishes


Won ton with noodle soup ($3.25) features savory won ton in a pungent, almost smokey chicken broth.


Combination of beef with rice noodle soup ($3.25) begins as a rather plain soup with beef balls and slices of beef in broth. Supplementary condiments fill the table. Diners fix the soup to their own liking with: chili sauce, hoisin sauce, basil leaves, bean sprouts, lemon wedges, cilantro, scallions, and red and green jalapeno peppers. A few squirts of lemon juice, some basil leaves, and a couple of other ingredients and I transformed my bowl of soup into my own version of perfection.


A whole fish doused with a sweet and sour sauce ($7.50) was perfectly cooked. The sauce was not too sweet and was spicy too. The fish was garnished with a generous sprinkling of cilantro springs and ginger shavings.


Spicy lemon beef salad ($5.50) is not for everyone as the salad is composed of tender slices of raw beef. The thin slices of meat are attractively arranged with slices of onion and lemon and garnished with peanuts, cilantro, and mint.


Other enjoyable dishes include: BBQ shrimp with rice noodle ($5.50), stuffed squid ($4.75), marinated prawns ($5.95) and hot and sour soup ($4.95).


Close, But No Cigar


Everything that I have tried at Quoc Te has been good in its own way although there are definitely some dishes which pale by comparison. Compared to the bold seasoning in most of the food at the restaurant, the following dishes were dressed with a non-descript bland sauce: ginger beef ($4.25), sauteed chicken with vegetables ($3.75), and shrimp and beef noodles ($3.95).


Frog legs had good flavor but they were somewhat greasy. The sour eel firepot ($12.95) also had good flavor but the individual pieces of eel had a strong flavor and would have been more appealing had the eel been skinned.


In general, I would pass by the dishes on the menu which are described as being sauteed as they tend to be either bland or somewhat stew-like in consistency. The sauce for chicken in coconut and curry ($3.75) was so viscous I wondered if it had been made with okra.


Refreshments And Desserts


Quoc Te fresh squeezes their lemonade and offers a plethora of other beverages such as soft drinks, coconut soda, tea, coffee, beer, wine, and a superb Vietnamese ale.


Desserts all cost $1.25 and the choice ranges from fruits (longan, lychee, and rambutan) to a delicate flan au rhum and a fried banana with a honey glaze.

One day a friend . . . from Kampuchea, looking very distraught; said, ""I don't know what on to . . . that . . . asked. He went on to . . . worried about his . . . children's development. In the United States, . . . a parent, . . . my country,"" he said. ""children listen to their parents. If they . . . we can beat them. Over here . . . do that, I go to jail.""


At first, I made a judgment on what he had said, thinking to myself, ""Oh, he shouldn't beat his children."" Later, I started to think that not too long ago in the U.S. children being ""taught to the sound of the hickory stick"" was an accepted practice.


Sharyne Shiu Thorton crosscultural health specialist for the International District Community Health Center, explained that what is right and wrong is not definitive rather, it is dictated by the norms of a society. In the United States, the dominant-norm is the white middle class. As a result our social and thus, legal definitions of issues such as sexual or domestic violence reflect that class perception of what is acceptable.


With the emergence of people from other cultures the presumed meanings of domestic and sexual violence break down. What do these terms mean? Thornton explained that even within our own culture, people have different definitions for just the word ""domestic.""


Does domestic mean household related, or kinship related? Let's suppose there is a woman who just got married and moved out of her parents' house into an apartment on Beacon Hill. Then one day, her father comes over and beats her. If you define domestic to be household related, this scenario would not be considered ""domestic"" violence because the violence took place between people from different households.


Due to the diversity of interpretations of sexual and domestic violence, the Asian Pacific Islander Family Violence Project, a community-based committee composed of a variety of educational and professional services and agencies, collected data from the males and females of four Southeast Asian groups. With this data, they have learned more about these groups cultural definitions of domestic and sexual violence.


""In order to have an interface of meaning, you have to understand from both perspectives,"" Thornton said.


To help health and legal professionals as well as volunteers improve their awareness of the different dynamics of domestic violence and sexual assault, the Asian Pacific Islander Family Violence Project committee will be holding a conference, titled ""Toward an Understanding of the Cultural Meaning of Domestic and Sexual Violence in Four Groups from Southeast Asia.""


During the first half of the conference the research and findings of the data that was collected will be presented. During the second half, there will be strategy workshops on the topic of working toward providing culturally sensitive services.


The conference will be held Friday, May 29, from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Jefferson Community Center. For more information call 325-5531.

LOS ANGELES -- With the election season heating up, two press conferences for Asian American candidates were held Monday.


Both Asian candidates -- Art Song Jr., for the 10th District seat on the L.A. City Council, and Warren Furutani, for the 7th District seat on the L.A. School Board -- received the endorsement of Councilman Michael Woo.


In announcing the endorsements, Woo stressed that he did not look at the color of the candidates' skin but at their abilities to build coalitions within the communities each will represent.


Song emphasized the need to combat crime in his district, where he said fear of lawlessness has prompted residents to put iron bars on the windows and doors of their homes. To shut down houses selling drugs, he suggested a high visibility of police cars cruising the neighborhoods, a technique which helped close houses of prostitution 10 years ago.


In the final weeks before the April 14 election all other candidates are walking precincts with their wives, families, friends and volunteers to drum up support. They have been attending countless forums and fundraisers.


Song has done a few things differently. His campaign has contracted for huge billboards in 10 strategic spots in the 10th District, including Koreatown.


Last week a contingent of Korean senior citizens moblized to visit businesses and residences of the district to solicit contributions for Song. They raised an estimated $7000.


Furutani has garnered an impressive list of endorsements, including those of Reps. Mervyn Dymally, Robert Matsui and Norman Mineta; state Sen. Diane Watson; Assemblymembers Richard Floyd, Teresa Hughes, Gwen Moore, Richard Polance, Curtis Tucker and Maxine Waters; L.A. Councilman Richard Alatorre, L.A. City Attorney Jim Hahn, the California Teachers Assn., Gardena's Mayor Pro Tem Mas Fukai and Councilman Dr. Paul Tsukahara, Carson City Councilman Mike Mltoma, Torrance City Councilman George Nakano, Dr. William Johnston, Pat Morita, Kai Parker, Carmen Perez, Sab Shimono and George Takei.

STANFORD -- A growing population of non-Asians from throughout the Bay Area are seeking out acupuncture and other forms of Chinese medicine in San Francisco's Chinatown, especially when Western medicine has failed to meet their needs, according to a recent Stanford University Medical School study.


The study, conducted by medical student Chen-Tan Lin and funded by the National Fund for Medical Education and the Stanford Medical Alumni Association's Medical Scholars Program, indicates that the two forms of medical practice will be integrated in the coming years.


""Chinese medicine is a tradition of medical practice with vast practical experience and many valid therapeutics which often succeed where modern Western medicine does not,"" Lin found.


""Integration of these systems, or at least improvement of communication between these two vital traditions, will be a medical and social priority in the years to come,"" he concluded.


The likeliest way for these two forms of medicine to be combined, Lin added, is through the physician-acupuncturist. In San Francisco only five physicians currently are trained in acupuncture, even though 247 acupuncturists in San Francisco are state-certified.


Lin interviewed 60 patients, often with the aid of an interpreter, and 20 providers: physicians and acupuncturists. About 35 percent of patients did not live in Chinatown, and the proportion of non-Asian patients varied from 50 to 100 percent of a provider's practice. Many went to an acupuncturist after a Western physician did not provide successful therapy. For subsequent ailments, some went straight to an acupuncturist instead of a physician.


Most of the ailments presented to acupuncturists were chronic; including neuromuscular problems such as headaches, backaches and stress; metabolic problems such as hypertension and arthritis; gastrointestinal or gynecologic problems.


While acupuncturists were receptive to Western medicine, Lin found, the opposite was true in reverse. ""The major complaint of acupuncturists about MDs is that they are rather closed-minded about alternatives to Western care,"" he said.


Acupuncturists and patients alike perceive that ""Western medicine is increasingly specialized, losing its touch with the entire person and focusing instead on a particular disease process."" Lin said.


At the start of the study, Lin was concerned about patients who took Chinese medicines and herbs and Western prescription medicines. To his surprise, there were no cases of adverse interactions.


But, he said, there is a need for increased communication and knowledge among practitioners of both traditions. ""This includes more exposure to alternative medicine for medical students and physicians in training,"" he said, and a legitimization of acupuncture by the medical profession.

Relatives of U.S. citizens waiting to immigrate to the United States from Hong Kong and the Philippines can expect to wait two years for a visa -- if they're very lucky. Others must wait 10 years or more.


Far more people have applied to immigrate from these countries than the quota which are allowed to come each year, so an enormous backlog of visa applications has accumulated, and only the closest relations of U.S. residents are even being considered.


A similar situation exists in mainland China, Korea, Mexico, India and the Dominican Republic, according to figures recently released by the Visa Office of the U.S. State Department.


Priority is assigned to visa applications according to a complicated preference system based on the closeness of the relationship of the applicant to a U.S. citizen.


The first preference (highest priority) is for unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens. The applicants from Hong Kong currently being granted visas applied before Aug. 7, 1984. Those from the Philippines applied before Jan. 1, 1985.


Applications under the first preference are being processed up to the present for all other countries, but several are backlogged for the other preference categories.


The only second preference applicants -- the spouses, unmarried sons or unmarried daughters of lawful permanent residents -- who are being processed from Hong Kong are those who applied before Oct. 3, 1979.


For mainland China, Korea and India that date is Nov. 1, 1985. For the Philippines it's Nov. 15, 1980.


Prospects are a little better for third preference candidates--those who have special abilities in the sciences or arts or are members of the professions, in most countries. Applications as recent as June 1, 1986 are being processed for those in mainland China, Korea and India.


But for Hong Kong that date is Sept. 16, 1981, and for the Philippines it is Dec. 15, 1970.


Fifth preference visas range from Oct. 22, 1981 to June 8, 1974, and sixth preference from Feb. 15, 1985 to unavailable. Nonpreference visas are not available for the countries named above.

On a summy September noon in 1985 lunchtime crowds gathered in Pioneer . . . to watch Sankai Juku - five Japanese performers with shaven heads, totally covered with white body make-up -- descend down the side of a building, hanging upside down with ropes bound around their ankles. The public performance . . . a new form of Japanese avant-garde dance theatre, where the dancers would writhe and claw at the air in a ""dance of birth and death.""


As dancer Yoshiyuki Takada prepared to hang upside down, his rope snapped. He fell 80 feet to the ground and died shortly thereafter. The crowd of 1,000 watched in stunned silence, then many began to weep, hugging each other for support -- a scene repeated endlessly on the evening news. The grieving onlookers, overcome by the performer's ultimate sacrifice for his art, placed poetry and other mementos near the spot where Takada fell. One message read that, before the accident, ""it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.""


After Takada's death, Sankai Juku cancelled the rest of its 1985 tour. Determined to start again in Seattle, Sankai Juku regrouped and returned for a . . . Seattle performance in 1986.


On November 27 through 29, Sankai Juku will come to Seattle again with three performances at Meany Hall on the University of Washington campus.


The group, composed of five male dancers, is part of a new dance movement in Japan called ""butoh."" Founded in the 1960s, this new, revolutionary art form combines dance, drama and mime, rejecting Western dance techniques and the stoic rigidity of Japanese Noh and Kabuki in favor of explosively emotional themes expressed directly through actions and gestures. Translated. Sankai Juku means ""studio from the land of mountain and sea.""


After a stunning American debut in 1984 at the Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival, Sankai Juku continued with successful performances in Europe, the Middle East, Mexico and Japan. A review in Time magazine said, ""Sankai Juku's unique voice may come to seem like greatness... It is not like anything else. Rather it becomes the thing that all else is like.""


Sankai Juku is noted for its poetic and powerful images. For the Seattle performance, the group will present the Seattle premiere of Jomon Sho (Homage to Pre-History). Choreographed by Artistic Director Ushio Amagatsu, the origins of life are interpreted in a series of abstract movements that become an intriguing metaphor for man's relationship with nature and his environment.


Tickets are $22, $19 and $16 for the 8 p.m. performances on November 27 and 28, and the 2 p.m. matinee performance on Sunday, November 29. For tickets and information, call the UW Arts Ticket Office at 543-4880.

Two University of Washington researchers are conducting a study to find out why Japanese Americans have such a high rate of diabetes.


Through the study, Dr. Wilfred Fujimoto, principal investigator, and Dr. Donna Leoneth, project director, hope to discover the social, cultural and hereditary factors that cause the disease. After pinpointing those factors, they hope to utilize the data for further research in finding a cure.


The diabetes research project has been funded in two phases. The first grant of $750,000 from the National Institute of Health covers the study of Nisei (second generation) men. The second grant of $2.3 million recently awarded by the U.S. Public Health Service, is for extended five-year research that includes the study of Nisei women, work that has already begun, and study of Sansei men and women, which will start in 1988.


The first phase of the study, conducted between November, 1983 and June, 1985, tested 241 Nisei men in King County, ranging in age from 45 to 74. Preliminary data confirmed that 20 percent of the group tested positive for diabetes and 35 percent had IGT (borderline diabetes). IGT is not an intermediate stage to diabetes, although some do develop the disease, explained Fujimoto.


The study found that the rate of diabetes among Nisei men is four times greater than that of similar-age men in Japan, and twice as high as that among white men of similar ages in the United States.


Based on date from the study of Nisei men, an interim report last August stated that diabetes was found in a full sibling or a parent in 50 percent of men with diabetes, 43 percent of mere with IGT, and 29 percent of men with normal glucose . . .


A surprising 50 percent of men who thought they had normal glucose tolerance were found to be abnormal, 11 percent actually had diabetes, while 39 percent had IGT. Diabetic men also appeared to have a life history with stress-producing events and experiences.


These finding are significant because both diabetes and IGT are related to the occurrence of cardiovascular disease: high blood pressure, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary heart disease.


So far, the findings indicate that environmental conditions in the U.S. are responsible for the higher rates of diabetes among Japanese Americans.


The stress of World War II and the interment camps affected the Nisei and the Issei (first generation) differently, said Leonetti. Being married at a young age or having a limited social environment, such as church, can buffer more stressful experiences.


""And for the Nisei to recover, they had to set aside things in their lives and not deal with it right away,"" she said. ""But those deep down emotions, if left to fester, can cause problems later on.""


The diabetes study will also explore the role of differing social and cultural factors among the Nisei, Sansei (third generation) and Yonsei (fourth generation).


Leonetti wants to allay the fears of those who hesitate to participate in this study because they may discover they have diabetes.


""This information is not just valuable to all Japanese Americans, but to all Americans and those Japanese in Japan,"" Leonetti said: ""This information will have world-wide importance.""


Chiz Norton, a member of the study's advisory committee, said, ""The part that is scary is that the diabetes can go unnoticed or untreated and terrible complications can occur. But the disease can be controlled.""


For the second phase of the diabetes study, the researchers hope to get about 500 to 700 persons to respond to a survey, a desirable number for a good sample. About half that number will be asked to participate in the study. They will be interviewed before taking a multitude of tests at University Hospital.


""We want to further our knowledge of diabetes and heart disease."" said Fujimoto. ""We want to find ways to prevent it or reduce its risk.


""Nisei have really interesting lives. I'm impressed with what they've gone through and what they've accomplished. They were born and raised from immigrant families, and have really done a complete cultural change.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Seven Pacific Rim cities, six of whom share sister city relatonships with San Francisco, will be the focal point of the 1987 San Francisco Fair and International Exposition, August 27-30 at the Civic Center.


The cities and countries that will be featured at the Exposition include Osaka, Japan; Shanghai, China; Seoul, Korea; Sydney, Australia; Taipei, Taiwan; Manila, Philippines; and Hong Kong.


Each will present an elaborate pavilion in Brooks Hall. They will encompass the many links between San Francisco and her important overseas relations in business and cultural areas. The pavilions are designed to present fair-goers with an immediate impression on the vital connections between San Francisco and her overseas sister cities, according to Suyin Fong and Ronit Milstein, who are handling the fair's Pacific Rim section.


""We are hoping that people who attend the International Exposition will get to know a little bit more about these Pacific Rim populations and also have fun,"" said Milstein. ""They will be able to enjoy themselves and learn what these Pacific Rim cities bring to The City,"" she added.


She indicated that approximately 168 Pacific Rim groups will be represented, some of which will include consumer goods and service organizations. In addition Milstein said the Asian Business League will be answering inquiries concerning doing business with Pacific Rim countries.


Susan Stowens, executive director of the fair, anticipates the number of fair-goers this year will exceed 60,000.


""This year we wanted to expand the fair beyond a local community producton and show case it as national and International. And with the 75th aniversary of the Pananma Pacific Expositon coming up in 1990, focusing the sister cities it seemed like the natural thing to do,"" said Stowens.


She said Fair goers can enjoy the pavilions, international food and cultural entertainment. Stowens sees a direct connection between Pacific Rim countries and San Francisco and thinks the exposition will visualize the relationship.


""There is a large Pacific population in The City and indications show that they will be the future here. We have close ties with the Pacific Rim.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The National Democratic Council of Asian and Pacific Americans-will hold its first National Convention, ""Target '88: The Margin of Victory,"" Oct. 16-18 at the Hyatt Los Angeles Airport Hotel.


The convention will focus on the increasing role and participation of Asian Pacific Americans in the Democratic National Convention and the American political process. Highlighting the weekend will be Democratic presidential hopefuls who will address the nation's Asian Pacific American Democratic leadership, according to a press release.


The convention will provide an important vehicle for promoting unity among the nation's Asian Pacific American Democrats; developing a national strategy for increasing participation of Asian Pacific Americans in the 1988 Democratic National Convention; presenting an Asian Pacific American platform agenda to the presidential candidates; and communicating to the candidates that Asian Pacific American voters will hold them accountable to Asian Pacific American concerns.


NDCAPA executive director Susan Lee states, ""Contrary to the belief of most politicans, Asian Americans are involved in the political process -- with votes and campaign funds. We will be looking for responsiveness and accountability. An autographed photo with a candidate or elected official will no longer be enough to get a campaign contribution from Asian American voters. Asian American voters are no longer 'dispensable.' We want substantive and tangible returns for all our contributions and efforts. The 1988 Presidential elections will be a prime time to make our voices heard.""


The council is a non-profit organization dedicated to voicing the concerns and enhancing the economic well-being of Asian Pacific Americans. Since opening a Washington, D.C. office in December 1986, the council has been lobbying for important legislation and Asian Pacific American appointments. Some of the legislative issues include immigration, racial violence, economic development, English-only initiatives, bilingual education, education, English literacy, redress and alleged anti-Asian admission policies at universities around the nation.

Rep. Daniel E. Lungren responded last week to charges that he had showed insensitivity to ethnic minorities through his votes on hate crimes, multilingual ballots, immigrant employees and South Africa.


The issues were raised by Asian American leaders who oppose Lungren's appointment as California state Treasurer. Both houses of the state legislature must confirm Lungren after he is officially nominated by Gov. Deukmejian.


Hate, Crimes


Lungren said that he had opposed a bill introduced in February by Reps. Norman Mineta, D-Calif. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn and two other congressmembers requiring the U.S. Justice Department to gather statistics on crimes motivated by ethnicity race or religion because he did not believe the statistics would be accurate.


Asians civil rights groups have lobbied for this bill because, while there are many reports that violence against Asians is increasing nationwide, there are no statistics to prove at. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission recommended such legislation in its 1986 report on anti-Asian violence. A similar bill passed in the House in 1985 but never in the Senate.


""I have no problem at all in collecting the data if you could get accurate data. Lungren said. ""But it may not be anything to do with reality. It might be misleading; you could have data saying that the number of incidents of hate crimes was declining or increasing when it really wasn't.""


He said the only crimes that the Justice Department could tabulate would be court cases in which the prosecutor had proved that a crime was motivated by race ethnicity religion or sexual orientation, anything else would be speculation.


""Rarely if ever has the prosecutor proved that a crime was due to an ethnic motive,"" said Lungren. ""The best estimate that they have is that a low percentage of crimes are reported.""


Lungren emphasized that he had voted against an amendment to remove the reference to sexual orientation from the bill.


Asked what he thought was an appropriate federal response to the apparent increase in anti-Asian violence he said the government could gather some information, express concern and prosecute criminal gangs that cross state boundaries.


""To suggest that the federal government would be the prime level to respond to hate crimes would be to suggest that the federal government was the prime level to respond to all crimes,"" he said.


Multilingual Ballots


""Lungren voted for a proposed amendment to the Voting Rights Act to strike from it the requirement that ballots be provided in the language of any group who speaks a language other than English and comprises over 5 percent of a district's voters. The amendment did not pass.


""The incentive to learn English is undercut"" by the current law he said.


He did vote to maintain the portion of the act that requires such ballots where the state has actively restricted . . . language groups from exercising their right to vote.


As an example of an area . . . he thought bilingual ballots . . . necessary, he said there was at county in Texas where . . . students were not allowed . . . attend high school.


Immigrant Employees


Lungren voted for a successful amendment to the Immigration Act of 1986 that makes it legal for employer to discriminate in hiring between U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States if they are equally well qualified for a position.


He said that he wished to prevent employers from being sued for discrimination just because they had chosen to hire a citizen instead of a non-citizen. Some federal contracts especially defense contracts, can only go to employers who hire only U.S. citizens, he said.


He added that he had opposed a proposal to leave to individual employers the choice of which . . . they asked to prove . . . status in the United States . . . he feared employers . . . discriminate against ethnic minorities by demanding status verification from only certain groups. The law now requires employers to verify the status of all the employees.


South Africa


Lungren opposed a House resolution prohibiting future investment by U.S. companies in South Africa as a way of punishing its government for racist laws. He said this policy would . . . blacks working an that country. The resolution passed in both louses over a presidential . . .


Lungren supported a failed resolution calling on U.S. companies to abide by the Sullivan principles, a set of antidiscriminatory practices which the companies were to observe in all their dealings in the country.

WASHINGTON -- At the request of California Reps. Robert Matsui and Norman Mineta, the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights has agreed to hold hearings on racially motivated violence.


""It is time to move beyond the Vincent Chin case and concentrate on expanding our efforts to prevent racially motivated violence, Matusi said. ""We need to work in new directions to stop race-related violence against Asian Americans, and one of our first steps will be the hearings in Congress on the increase in racially motivated crimes in the United States.


In responding to Matsui and Mineta's requests for hearings, Rep. Don Edwards, chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional and Civil Rights, said violence aimed at Americans of Asian descent appears to be a growing nationwide problem.


""Recent immigration, trade tension and the deterioration of civil rights in the atmosphere created by the Reagan administration have combined to make the situation extemely volatile,"" Edwards said.


Matsui said that in the most recent statistics, new cases of violence against Asian Americans as reported to the Justice Department increased 62 percent from 1984 to 1985.

Albert Gore refused to respond to Asian Week's questionnaire, but following is the text of Albert Gore's 7/18/87 speech to the Organization of Chinese Americans.


America has always been a nation of immigrants. My family, the Gores of Smith County, Tennessee, came here to help found the Virginia settlement of Jamestown in 1607. We were here to greet the Pilgrims when they landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. In fact, the Gores have been here so long that I may well have more cousins than any Presidential candidate in history.


We Gores thought we got here first, but it turns out that Chinese Americans began arriving on this continent in the 1500s -- at least 50 years before Thomas Gore stepped ashore at Jamestown.


Moreover, we now know that a thousand years before that, a Chinese explorer named Hui Shen had sailed east across the Pacific and discovered a vast wooded continent that he named Fusang. According to many historians, Fusang was none other than the continent of North America. Your ancestors came to America more than a millennium before my family arrived in Virginia.


Furthermore, Native Americans came here across an ancient land bridge from Asia.


So on behalf of all of us Gores. I would like to thank you for finding such a great country and letting us come on in.


The history of Chinese American -- like the history of all Asian Americans, of which Chinese Americans are a particularly distinguished group -- is as stirring as it is long. It is a tale of courage, of extraordinary determination and hard work, and of well-earned rewards and achievements.


From the first wave of Chinese immigrants who panned for gold in California to the laborers who built the transcontinental railroad that brought this land together, Chinese Americans have worked to fulfill the promise of America.


Yet despite their dedication and successes, Chinese Americans in the nineteenth century often found that this country could be a place of bitter truths. Listen to a poem by an old timer who remembers coming here from China as a youth.


Let's go to America!


Let's go to America!


Now here I am in this paradise -- But where is it?


All too often, Chinese Americans came looking for paradise and found prejudice instead. The Exclusionary Act of 1872, for example, prohibited immigration from China for several years. Until the ultimate repeal of the Act in 1943, America essentially hung out a sign that read: ""No Chinese need apply.""


But of course Chinese Americans did apply. With the same hope and determination that brought them to this land, they worked harder than ever for their families and their future.


In this century, Chinese Americans have climbed ever higher on the ladder of success in this country. Your story is truly one of greatness.


Americans of Asian descent constitute only 2 percent of the U.S. population. Yet Asian Americans make up 12 percent of the freshman class at Harvard and 20 percent at the University of California at Berkeley. Those figures reflect America's investment in the talent and genius of some of its brightest students -- an investment which we must continue to meet.


Some of you are concerned that some American universities seem to apply unwritten informal quotas to limit the number of Asian American students. I sincerely hope that no college or university is guilty of such a practice. I can promise you this: As a newly elected member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, I intend to see not only that Harvard continues to renounce such quotas, but that they are not imposed at any university anywhere.


In every aspect of our culture, Asian Americans have made this nation richer, wiser, and more productive. From engineering entrepreneurs like An Wang of Wang Laboratories and David Lee of Qume Computers to architects like I.M. Pei and musicians like Yo Yo Ma, Chinese and other Asian Americans have earned tremendous respect and admiration. That includes successful entrepreneurs like Min-Nan Sze and scientist-managers managers like Susan Wu and Charles Wang.


And yet is appears that alongside that respect and admiration has come some unjustified resentment -- an emotion that has no place in a pluralistic democratic nation.


Like the Chinese who came to America in the last century, some Asian Americans sense a new wave of hostility today. We know all too well the terrible case of Vincent Chin, the young man who on the eve of his wedding day was brutally murdered by two men in Detroit.


Other cases are just as tragic, such as Gary Moy, who was stabbed while waiting for a bus in Brooklyn by an assailant shouting, ""Chinese don't belong in this neighborhood.""


Or Yong Lee, a Korean American grocer shot down in is store. Or Anh Mai, a Vietnamese American shot to death in Boston.


These shameless murders reflect a tiny but disturbing strain of xenophobic paranoia, in a nation troubled by economic change and turmoil.


All Americans must join together to condemn such behavior. Here in the South, we are proud of the great progress we have made to overcome racism. We look forward to an America where the doors of opportunity will open wider still to all our citizens.


A nation that wants to protect the rights and opportunities of all its people must do more to put people of every race and background in positions of power. Like you, I am concerned that the Asian-American community is still not represented on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights! And I am disappointed that the current Administration has done so little to promote civil, equal, and human rights. This President's record reminds me of the old story about putting a fox in a henhouse to guard the chickens. As President, I will do everything in my power to shape a new and fair America for all Americans.


Together we must attack the roots of prejudice as well as its symptoms. The single most important cause of hateful violence is fear.


Asian Americans appear to face unjust resentment not only for achievements here in America, but indirectly as a result of the great success of nations along the Pacific Rim. The current Interest in protectionist legislation may be partly based on fear and resentment on economic terms. The fear is intolerable and the legislation will not work.


We must solve our trade problems through leadership, not fear. A President must provide strong leadership and demand the removal of unfair trade barriers overseas, insisting on action rather than promises. We must move not toward protectionism but toward a more open trading environment around the world. We need a President who will address those factors at home that can improve our ability to compete.


We must rebuild and renew America's economic base, to regain the security of American jobs and remove the shadow of fear that can turn citizens against each other. We can win without a trade war -- by insisting on perfectionism, not protectionism.


You already know the one secret that will enable us to compete. In short, we must feed the dreams of our young people, and give them the knowledge and training to adapt to a changing world.


Our schools are our future. We must work together to give our children the best public elementary and secondary education system on earth -- second to none.


That means we need to make classrooms smaller and the school year longer, while paying teachers more in return. And we must do more to attract our best and brightest young people to the teaching profession.


Education is just another name for freedom. School is the ladder to a better and better life.


Meanwhile, we need to make a national commitment to policies that maintain and promote strong families -- with quality child care for working parents and affordable long-term care for the elderly. Even the finest schools and teachers cannot undo the harm caused by a welfare system that divides families and a society that promotes drug abuse and undermines traditional values.


It's time for realistic, constructive welfare reform -- and it's time that we got serious about the war on drugs.


Our ancestors came to this continent one by one in the hope of joining together to make a glorious nation. That remains our great challenge: to unfold the promise of freedom and opportunity for all Americans. It is a grand dream, but a dream we can believe in.


Where we can dream, we can hope. Where we ca hope, we can act -- and as we act together, we can grow.


We need leadership to heal the divisions among us. But the real division is not between Asian and European, North and South, young and old or rich or poor. The most serious division is between those who look at the awesome challenges we confront and fear the future, and those who on the other hand look at the same problems and feel welling up within them a commitment to work together to rekindle the American spirit and build the great dream all Americans share -- a future with hope.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Substance abuse use among Asian Americans is accelerating, according to experts who blame the growth on drug accessibility and acceptance, and even pressure Asian families put on their children to succeed.


""Five years ago we were seeing 1 to 2 percent Asians here, and now 15 to 16 percent of the people that come into the clinic are Asian,"" said Dr. Darryl Inaba, director of the Drug Detoxification Project of the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. He said most Asian drug problems center on two drugs -- cocaine and quaaludes.


""There seem to be different drugs for different Asians. But generally within the older groups, like the late 20s and 30s, there is a growing concern with coeaine use. It brings on addiction and criminal behavior. And quaaludes are a major problem among Asians,"" said Inaba.


He cited a 1985 survey, conducted by the Asian American Substance Abuse Task Force among Chinatown youth, indicating that 61 percent of those polled admitted to having used quaaludes.


""Quaaludes are seen as the ideal party drug, the festive drug that has the effects of alcohol without the side effects,"" said Inaba.


But he warned that the drug brings on depression. Others say that after using the drug, they fail to remember what they did while feeling its affects.


Dr. Davis Ja, director of the Asian American Residential Recovery Services in San Francisco, agrees with Inaba that quaaludes are readily used by many Asian Americans and believes that there might be some psychological or genetic precedent for its high use among Asians.


In reference to this statement Ja mentioned that a number of Asians blush in the face while drinking alcohol, and thus prefer quaaludes.


""Cocaine and crack are a big problem too. It is dangerous and the number one fear for us,"" said Ja. ""When people take it they get very active and want to do a lot of things. They feel like they are on top of the world and feel invincible as if there is nothing they can't do.""


But he warned that after the high wears off, users may feel anxious, irritable or depressed; some even feel suicidal. And because cocaine is so expensive, many users end up stealing, cheating, lying and setting drugs to support their habit. Family friends and commitments are secondary considerations to cocaine addicts. Cocaine also has the . . . of causing instant death because a big ""hit"" or an overdose can stop a user's heart. Ja stressed the risk of imprisonment is also another variable because cocaine is illegal.


""In the community newer people are getting into it and they are becoming addicted. These are intelligent sensitive people, good people, but they do not understand that cocaine is addictive,"" said Inaba.


Crack is also a growing problem in the community, especially among younger youth because it is less expensive than cocaine. ""Crack is as addictive as heroin and is seep as a problem,"" said Ja.


In addition he said alcohol and marijuana use are also very widespread within the Asian American communities.


Inaba pointed out that there are different drug preferences among various Asian ethnic groups.


""Based on inference on what I see. I find that Chinese and Japanese are about the same in their use of quaaludes and cocaine, Asian Pacific Islanders tend to use PCP, and for Southeast Asians there is a shift towards opium,"" said Inaba.


He said that the use of PCP, which is a drug used to sedate large wild animals, is very dangerous.


""It is the most devastating. The person on it thinks he has a lot of power and strength, and it causes amnesia.""


A San Francisco law enforcement agent and expert on opium and heroin, who wished not to be identified, said that many Hmong and Mein from Laos have dependencies on opium.


""They brought their habit with them from Asia. Usually it is limited to the older adult male, age 45 or over. I'd say one-third of this age group are addicted to opium.""


He said in their country the drug is taken to enhance relaxation and sometimes is taken to alleviate pain.


Ja suggested a number of factors which may be attributed to the growth of drug use among Asian Americans.


""There has been an increased accessibility of drugs. They are widespread and we are a drug-using society -- over-the-counter or otherwise. We also follow role models in our culture, and many of our parents use alcohol. They do not always make the best models for us. Also Asians face high expectations from their parents, and youths have a difficult time meeting these expectations"" said Ja.


Inaba suggested that lack of communication within families may also be a factor that lends to drug abuse and dependencies.


""In Asian cultures debt or disease is not . . . for discussion. There is a saying that if you talk about if, it will happen. It is a barrier to understanding. And Asians see their problems as personal, not as an illness. But an addiction is an illness. The Japanese and Chinese cultures sort of adopt impossible society values and the model minority image.""


Inaba said that because Asian Americans tend to bury their drug addiction problems, it causes resource shortages for Asian American agencies because it appears Asians have no drug problems.


""Asians do have drug problems even if they say they do not exist. That is the big problem -- just perpetuates the denial and doesn't focus on the problems,"" said Inaba.


""The Asian community is not immune to any problems like substance abuse, mental health problems or AIDS. We have to become more sensitive and cooporative in the efforts to minimize these conditions,"" stressed Inaba.


San Francisco has two residential recovery units specifically designed for Asians with substance abuse problems, which Inaba and Ja ad . . . There and also several other agencies and programs available in the Bay Area to help those with drug problems.


The Asian programs include the two-year-old AARRS program and the Bill Pone Memorial Unit for Asian Americans which was set up in the early 1980s. The BPMU located in the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic was the first recovery unit in San Francisco geared for Asian Americans.


""We see out-patients and do counseling for substance abuse here. There are about 80 to 90 Asians that come in for treatment and support each month,"" said Inaba.


Ja said participants at AARRS which average in age at 24, stay in an environment and are with staff that are culturally sensitive to their needs. He explained that the participants go through a lot of counseling during their 18 to 24-month stay. He said some of the counseling ""marathon sessions"" last hours at a time. During these sessions . . . are confronted and learn to open up and share their problems.


""They think they cannot be confronted that way, by spilling their guts. But they open up and learn to deal with their problems, said Ja.


He said the . . . staff emphasizes an appreciation and understanding of . . . development. The 15-bed, center which . . . as having 8 family at . . . becomes the . . . for those who . . . attempting to quit drugs and is and alternative to some who would other . . .

Looking at responses to the Asian Week Readers' Poll, when broken down into the six largest response areas by Zip Code, one sees varying degrees of support for the candidates and different demographic profiles of Asian Week's readers.


Front-runner Nancy Pelosi won top support from a random sample of Asian Week readers in all districts surveyed. But her margin of victory rose or fell in areas with different dynamics in its Asian American populace.


Pelosi's greatest level of support -- 62.5 percent -- was in the West Portal area. Coincidentally, this was the same percentage of respondents whose age was 30-50. Seven out of every eight respondents from this area were college graduates, and the same proportion were native-born Americans. Four-fifths were Democrats, while fully one-eighth called themselves Independents. A whopping three-fourths were professionals. Two-thirds were men.


Pelosi's lowest support -- 38.3 percent -- was in the Outer Sunset. Here only 50 percent of the respondents were aged 30-50, and none were aged 18-30. The number of college graduates was still roughly seven out of every eight, but only 57 percent were American-born. Most other demographic categories came out close if not equal for both areas.


Similarly, Pelosi's support was 38.9 percent in North Beach, 42.1 percent in Diamond Heights and 43.2 percent in the Polk/Van Ness area. In all three areas about one-fifth of the respondents were foreign-born. From one-fourth to one-third were aged 30-50.


But there were differences in those three areas, also. The proportion of professionals ranged from a low of 52.8 percent in Polk-Van Ness to a high of 62.5 percent in North Beach. Republicans made up 37.5 percent of those in North Beach but only 19.4 percent in Polk/Van Ness and 15.8 percent in Diamond Heights. Women made up nearly half of the respondents in Diamond Heights but only a third in Polk/Van Ness and less than a fifth in North Beach.


Pelosi was supported by nearly half of the respondents in Chinatown. One-fourth here were foreign-born; five-sixths had a college education; nearly two-fifths were Republicans.


Supervisor Bill Maher -- with 19.6 percent overall -- is Pelosi's nearest competitor among Asian Week readers. His greatest support came from North Beach, Diamond Heights and Chinatown, areas with higher than usual concentrations of Republicans and native-born citizens.


Supervisor Harry Britt, who is Pelosi's strongest challenger among the general electorate (according to published polls), comes in second among Asian Week readers only in the Outer Sunset and West Portal. Both areas had higher concentrations of younger voters, and Democrats accounted for more than 80 percent of respondents in both districts.


Republican candidates fared miserably even with Republicans in the Asian Week Readers' Poll.


Front-running GOP candidate Harriet Ross got no support from the 12 Republican respondents in Chinatown, West Portal and the Outer Sunset. She got only four votes from the 16 Republicans in Polk/Van Ness, Diamond Heights and North Beach.


Undecided


What interests politicians and strategists the most, of course, is the ""undecided"" voters. In this category again the responses varied from one district to another.


For instance in the West Portal and Diamond Heights districts none of those responding to the survey said they were undecided as to who they would vote for on April 7.


But in Polk/Van Ness 8.1 percent failed to choose a single candidate.


That figure rose to 11.1 percent in North Beach.


In the Outer Sunset 11.8 percent stated no preference.


Thirteen percent of Chinatown's respondents were undecided.

For generations the vast, fertile lands of the American West attracted immigrants who dared to dream of a family farm, a place of their own. They arrived and worked the lands, created family and built settlements. They brought with them cultures and traditions that became rooted in their communities, altered by a different environment yet anchored in their new rural homes.


The story of one such ethnic farm community is told in Country Voices. The Oral History of a Family Farm Community by David Mas Masumoto. Three generations of an ethnic farm community speak out and tell of a not-so-easy blending of history and culture, of farming family and tradition. Through interviews, essays and photographs the saga of a Japanese American family farm community in the San Joaquin Valley of California is told.


Country Voices tells of the despair, humor and struggles of a people working the land and maintaining tradition, offering the reader the opportunity to step into a world of vineyards and orchards, of customs and meanings, and hear a people speak simple truths about a home and land enriched with culture.


Research for this book was conducted over a five-year period of Interviewing and collecting stories from farmers and their families, and from a lifetime of growing up, living and working on the land.


The author continues to be a part of rural America, farming 80 acres of peaches and grapes on his family's farm. From this vantage point of long-time observer and participant, Masumoto gathered stories about the sweat and sweetness of rich harvests and the cultural and spiritual growth of a people.


Masumoto, 33, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in sociology and holds a master of community development degree from UC Davis. A collection of his short stories, Silent Strength, was published in 1985 by New Currents International, Tokyo, Japan and is in its second printing. He has also published in the L.A. Times and won the James Clavell National Japanese American Literary Award in 1986.

It's amazing!


It's amazing that Joy Viveros could so fully document in a single stage performance an Asian American woman's inner struggle for identity, independence and fulfilling love.


It's amazing she could do all that but at the same time forget she had to get her audience's attention.


Joy Viveros's ""Being Present,"" which runs until Aug. 22 at the Climate Theatre, succeeds in expressing a wealth of complex thoughts and feelings from the too rarely seen perspective of the Third World woman. But the direct expository format she choses for this expression makes for a long and difficult evening.


Viveros uses nine actors to articulate the emotional experiences of a woman overcoming enormous obstacles on her route to self-fulfillment.


The composition of this cast in itself conveys the play's view point: seven of the nine actors are women, one is Puerto Rican, three are black, and three Asian (Willard Chin, Sunita Mukhi and Linda Nakamura). One wears braces and is listed in the program as ""Girl,"" another is ""Teen Woman"" and a third has grey hair. There are no white males in the cast.


The actors do not perform a traditional play with characters, a story and dialogue. Rather they take turns emerging in a spotlight from the darkness of the stage and reciting brief soliloquies.


Changes in scenes, of which there are 21, are indicated by some actors exiting, another entering and the others changing positions on the sets, which consist of a low ramp, a box, a bench, and a small platform with a wooden rail.


In a series of odes, aphorisms, rhapsodies and laments, in mostly colloquial language, the actors describe an unnamed woman's feelings about herself and her social interactions, particularly her love-life.


The first act begins with a scene titled ""Seeds"" and ends with one called ""Letting Go. As it opens, the actors express this woman's anxiety about being trapped in unequal relationships.


""Who am I, other than a response?"" the woman asks in the words of one actor. And in the voice of another she describes the quest ""to be free of someone else's understanding of me.""


""Now I want the prosperity of aloneness,"" this character decides, escaping the feeling of being ""hysterical to keep what you feel you never really have.""


While the actors wear loose-fitting, informal cothes throughout the play, the second act shows them more fully dressed, generally in darker colors than in the first. Also in the second act, for the first time, in some scenes they touch each other.


A new attitude of assertiveness and self-reliance, signaled by these changes, is also reflected in their speeches in scenes with titles like ""Discovery,"" ""Transformation"" and ""Birth Spark.""


Beginning with a description of what it means to be a ""melanin (dark-pigmented skin) woman,"" the longest monologue in the play, the central character shows a new capacity to analyze her problems. ""Does our defeat prove our inferiority?"" she asks.


And she decries the attitudes of ""men who find their manhood in inflexibility"" or who cannot accept her intelligence.


""We are entitled to enjoy our time in the world,"" announces one actor.


""Loving myself and loving other people are not two separate things,"" concludes another.


Many of these declarations are witty summations of wisdom learned through a long uphill struggle with life. Many neatly express insights into universal human situations. And the saga of a minority woman who finds the inner strength to overcome social oppression is an inspiring one.


But one can only assimilate so much of this kind of abstract rumination. Too often several actors reiterate the same idea with only minor variation. And too seldom does one actor stand in the spotlight long enough to bring one of these themes to full exposition.


A metal folding chair like those in the Climate Theater becomes brutally hard beneath one as two hours wear on, actor after actor delivering her or his brief speech without any dramatic movement on the stage.


The uneven quality of the acting makes concentration even more difficult.


Filipina Sunita Mukhi stands out among the actors as the most profoundly inspired. She exhales emotion in each of her speeches, working up to an inspired delivery of the ""melanin woman"" monologue in the second act in which she embodies the dark-skinned woman's gentle fury.


Adrea Adams and Elizabeth Stark, in the roles of ""Girl"" and ""Young Woman"" respectively, also stand out for the strength and subtlety of their performances.


But unfortunately several of the other performers appear uninterested in their own monologues, whining their laments and droning their rhapsodies.


The play's net effect is that of opening up a human mind and making an audience privy to its introspection. But in that mind's concentration on ""being present"" to concentrate on its own emotional needs, it has overlooked the presence of the audience.


Viveros, whose background is in poetry, has forgotten that a playwright must entertain as well as inform, that she cannot impart her wealth of wisdom until she can capture her public's attention.

LOS ANGELES -- Friends of the Chinatown Library recently held a open house at the Chinatown Branch Library at College and Yale streets. There were docent tour guides for the many guests who came to see the progress the library had made by its first expansion and will make in its second expansion. The guests were impressed by what the library offered in its small, and compact structure.


The Chinatown Branch is the only Los Angeles Public Library branch operating rent-free out of a Los Angeles United School District Building, Chinatown's Castelar Elementary School. In 1983 the first expansion was completed. It now has a new mezzanine and two wings, two stories high on opposite sides of the auditorium.


Inspirational words of Aksel G. S. Josephson about making good citizens of foreign immigrants, ""to provide them with books in their own language and about their old country ... When the immigrant has grown accustomed to finding his way to the public library, he will soon begin to read about his new country, to become more and more acquainted with the conditions under which he is to live,"" spurred this dream to come true for Dr. Ling Louie, whose children attended Castalar School, who founded the library and who, with the Friends of the Library, spearheaded the project. It did not come easy as it was a tremendous task with proposals, funding and convincing the ""right"" people that it was a viable project.


At the present time another expansion is needed. It seems as though the needs of the community and especially Castelar School are quickly bursting through the walls of the library. Space is needed and is at a premium. The expansion would provide a separate reading room for children only; an increase of 42 seats which would total 113 seats in the library; and an increase in stack area which is already over capacity. The Friends have a ""wish list"" as funds become available including public access computers and a video collection featuring educational and informational films that will teach phonics, mathematics, car repairs, and include classic feature films and children's films, special children's literature collection, toy loan collection, and storytelling puppets.


From 39,000 circulation of books during the first year of operation, the Chinatown library in 1985-1986 circulated 355,550 and is rated the fourth highest among the Los Angeles public libraries. Its patron count for that year is 210,182 and is probably much higher now. As of June 1986 the library collection totaled 54,613 volumes: 24,308 Chinese language; 27,002 English language; 1,000 Spanish language; 2,602 Vietnamese; and 5,000 Chinese-American volumes.


The architectural plans by Choy and Choy Asociates for the 1987 expansion were displayed. As the guests were enjoying the refreshments they viewed lovely Chinese paintings on exhibit by local artist Pat Tom. Lovely Miss Los Angeles Chinatown came to present a check to the Friends of the Library.


It is estimated that this expansion will cost $600,000. So far, project funding has been pledged by the State Library Grant of $114,000; Community Redevelopment Agency $250,000; and Friends of the Chinatown Library, $175,000.


Each item which has been donated in ""the name of"" or ""in the memory of"" holds a very special space in the library. The Special Children's Literature Collection is being developed in the memory of Mr. and Mrs. Tsin nan Ling, beloved parents of Louie. The Friends' roster includes not only many of the Chinatown residents, business people and leaders but also many who live in the neighboring cities who feel that this is a most worthwhile project.


The Friends of the Library invite the public to visit, to browse, and to enjoy the Asian atmosphere of this unusual library at 536 W. College Street in the heart of Chinatown.

Filipinos who suffer occasional pangs of nostalgia know where to purge their emotions and that's usually at a Filipino store where the sights, scents, and sounds relieve the old country. But there's one particular place where Filipino Americans, both homesick and happy, find every excuse to be at.


For some reason, the Serramonte Center, sprawled in the dressier side of Daly City, has become almost like a second home to Filipinos. Zenaida Costantino of Wells Fargo spends almost everyday of her life at this mall and when asked why she pointed to the park-like atmosphere where she says she likes unwinding after a long day, at work, or at home.


When investigative reporter Vic Torres dragged me off one weekday for coffee and calumny, he chose to do it at the same mall's fastfood section in his hope of bumping into a newspaper columnist known to be that mall's habitue.


In one of its recent issues, a Filipino newspaper ranked Serramonte Center as the ideal meet market for Filipinos and other Asians. And newspaper editor Ed Diokno passed to this column a sobriquet pundits have given the bustling shopping center -- SerraManila, because it draws Filipinos from all over the Bay Area, from up Vallejo and down San Jose.


It's true, exclaimed Constantino a great number of people don't mind taking the trek because they know that they will be among their own there. It's like being at a town fiesta, where strangers smile at each other, perchance to initiate conversation, maybe friendship-who knows?


Being a resident of Daly City, in fact of a home perched almost right above Serramonte Center, I may be one of the rare few who don't know what's happening down there. Because when I have the luxury of time, and the exigency of frustration, I prefer to get out of the old milieu.


But one day, taunted by my pal Al to decide for myself whether or not the eye of the new Manilatown is indeed in the making here, I decided to while away a Sunday afternoon in a solitary stroll in my mammoth neighbor.


Armed with a mission, I was more observant than I would have been had I just zipped by to get that carton of milk, or a roll of film. Last Sunday, I actually paid attention to what had always been a big blur in the corner of my eye.


It was only then that I noticed a sign at a hamburger bar: CORYBURGER. Properly intrigued, I asked the countergirl if the burger was named after a certain president she and I knew. Joy Buan looked up while counting cash in the register, and uttered what I discerned as a yes.


How I asked, was this burger dedicated to the president of the Philippines? And Ging Braganza gave the apparently not-so-secret recipe: it's marinated in soy sauce.


Cozy Nook, which will remain in my book as the home of the Coryburger, is owned by Troy Channing, whose wife, Cora, is Filipina. Ah, so.


Across from the Channing nook is a place where duality is the unspoken dictum; else, how explain the combination of bagels and ""guinataan,"" a Filipino snack made of coconut milk? Incongruous as the menu may sound, Bagels Plus gets its share of the weekend mob. Roderick Munsayac who's assigned to the counter on Sundays, said that the menu was formulated by Filipino owner, Gerry, (whose last name slipped Munsayac's memory) to draw the Filipinos.


But is there ever a dull day at Goldilocks? This food outlet is easy to distinguish because of the queues forming left and right of it, patrons leaving the lines bearing interesting-looking repasts any Filipino would be able to identify. The outlet is a branch of the popular Goldilocks at nearby Callan Boulevard. ""We opened at Serramonte first and foremost to cater to its particularly large number of Filipino customers."" claimed Johann Yuson, the bakeshop-restaurant chain's advertising manager.


At Serramonte, you will find Filipinos shopping or selling or simply slumming. But on a Sunday, you'll find most of them at the Food Court.


An ocular study may suggest that Filipinos are among the major clients of Serramonte Center but the actual figures disprove it. Or so says an employee of the center who did not wish to be identified.


""Our demographics show that Asians make up 28 percent of our customers, and there is no breakdown of the ethnic groups.""


It is a compliment to know that Filipinos look at Serramonte as a place they feel at home in, but no, said Linda Larsen, general manager of the Center, neither the apparent surge in Filipino patronage, not the high Filipino population in Daly City is of consequence in the establishment's marketing programs.


Citing herself a Californian, therefore recognizing the state as a ""melting pot of ethnic cultures,"" Larsen found it ""inappropriate thinking"" bordering on ""bias"" to consider ethnicity in such respect. ""We don't cater to any one particular ethnic community, we have a diverse mix coming to the center,"" she replied when asked for her reaction to the influx of Filipinos at the mall.


As for the nickname ""Serra-Manila?"" Larsen did not like it. ""That's not right. Our name is Serramonte Center,"" she said. Maybe she and Susan Stowens should have coffee sometime.

SACRAMENTO -- Jess Centeno has worn many different hats in his professional career.


In addition to his engineering background (he earned his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from National University), he has among other things been the president of a delivery service corporation, an insurance executive and a community college instructor.


At the present time he is working as a tax auditor for the Internal Revenue Service in San Francisco, where he and his wife Angelita make their home.


The 53-year-old Centeno, who immigrated from the Philippines about 17 years ago, has also donned a variety of hats in civic and community affairs.


He has long been very active with the Filipino Americans of Northern California (FANCO), and currently serves as the organization's executive vice president.


He is also president of the St. John's Filipino Association and the San Francisco County Drug Abuse Advisory Board. He served as chairman of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Week celebration, for which he was awarded a certificate of recognition by the Legislature.


A year and a half ago Centeno added yet another hat to his collection, having been appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to the California Child Development Programs Advisory Committee, As a member of this committee Centeno helps evaluate the effectiveness of programs, addressing such forefront issues as child abuse, educational services for pre-schoolers and childcare, particularly as they relate to children who are economically disadvantaged or physically or developmentally disabled.


The 25-member committee works closely with other state entities such as the Department of Education and the Health and Welfare Agency, as well as with community-based organizations to determine children's needs. It then makes recommendations to the governor on ways to confront these issues.


""Gov. Deukmejian recognizes the importance of involving people from the community in his administration,"" Centeno said recently, ""especially in areas that deal with the delivery of essential state services. I'm honored and very pleased that the governor has afforded me an opportunity to be a part of this committee's efforts to help children.""


He also commended the governor's ""Children's Initiative"" proposed in October, a $5 million program to bolster statewide childcare and medical services.


Fred Bautista works for the Governor's Office of Community Relations.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Telephone and other utility companies, and large locally owned firms ignore Asian Americans when seeking community representation of their boards of directors, a university president charged.


Dr. Chia-Wei Woo, president of S.F. State University, was given the United Nations Association's Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award last month. Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, and Fran Streets, first vice president of Bank of San Francisco, were also honored.


In his acceptance remarks Woo decried the lack of Asian American representation on such national bodies as the Civil Rights Commission, the Small Business Advisory Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Science Board.


When his audience chuckled at his remarks, however, Woo chided, ""Don't laugh -- I will come home to our own back yard in a moment.""


Woo, noticing that many audience members were ""corporate people,"" conceded that multi-national corporations such as Bechtel or Bank of America are not in positions to give representation to local constituencies.


""But the telephone company and the utility companies here usually look for a broad representation on their boards. You see women and other minorities on their boards, but not one (in San Francisco) has an Asian that I am aware of,"" Woo said.


Asian Americans make up approximately 30 percent of the population in San Francisco and, judging from demographic data, perhaps ""35-40 percent of the buying power. But not one of the boards of the major local supermarket chains has an Asian,"" Woo said.


Woo said he found it ""incredible"" that racism was not eliminated ""2000, 3000 years ago -- if we human beings were supposed to be the species that was intelligent and most fit to survive.


""I believe that we are the only species that takes into account... the color of our skin, the shape of our eyes, the structure of our cheekbones -- these totally superficial traits when compared to the extremely complicated physical and mental organisms that we are.""


Woo called for a ""proactive"" approach which celebrated ethnic diversity as a positive aspect of society.


Woo was given the award for his promotion of international understanding. It was presented to him at the UN Association's annual dinner commemorating the International Day for the Elimination of Racism.

'My first love has always been the stock market,"" exclaimed Josephine N. Wong assistant vice president of Merrill Lunch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith in Palo Alto.


She surmised she must have caught the investment bug from her father, a businessman in Hong Kong who was always, actively trading in the stock market. Even as a teenager she was fascinated with the financial world of stocks -- but it wasn't until 20 years later that she became an active broker in the field herself.


Born and raised in Hong Kong, Wong came to the United States for a college education. She earned her bachelor's degree at Southern Methodist University, and continued at Boston University to receive a master's degree in biochemistry. There she met her husband Hasting, a master's candidate in engineering.


After graduation, they came to California where Wong worked at Alza Syntex and Stanford University. While at stanford she worked with Dr. Norman Shumway, the noted heart transplant specialist. Her research led to a patent on an monoclonal antibody. Although she enjoyed research work, Wong began to realize that unless she had a medical degree, it would be a dead end job. She wanted work that would reward her achievements and contributions.


All too often in medical research, only the principal scientist receives all of the recognition for the done by the other researching scientists,"" she said in retrospect.


Having kept up her interest in stocks, she decided to try her luck by calling on firms in hopes of a job. One manager discouraged her saying she had two strikes against her.


""He said one drawback was that I was an Asian, and the other being a woman. Indignantly I told him these will be my assets, and I think I have proved him wrong,"" Wong said.


One manager at Davis Skaggs gave me an assessment test and said I had all of the criteria for success as a stockbroker, and I was on my way,"" continued Wong. Eventually she moved to Merrill Lynch where she now holds the esteemed position of assistant vice president.


When asked about the pluses and minuses of her work, Wong admitted that initially soliciting clients by making cold phone calls is probably the most difficult part for everyone. However, she said that this is overshadowed by the satisfaction you get when a phone call prospect turns into a client -- particularly when you can help the client make money. Now most of her clients are based on referrals.


Seven years since Josephine Wong has become a stockbroker, she concluded, ""It has become a much more competitive field with banks and discount brokers getting into the act."" Realizing that financial planning was gaining popularity in the United States, Wong took a two year night program though the College for Financial Planning in Denver, Colorado to become a certified financial planner.


""I am happy using this background to help clients create personalized financial plans toward investing,"" she said.


Wong felt there is a need for more Asians and women to go into the field. She commented that the field is ready for more Asians, but an interested person should talk to a broker to learn firsthand what a brokers's life is like.


""A person needs to be knowledgeable, hard working, people and service oriented, as well as aggressive to become a success in this business. One must constantly increase one's client base and also spend much time doing fundamental and technical research on companies and available investments so one can provide clients with the best investment choices,"" she said. And she added that investment actually is an art not a science.


""However it is a wonderful field that I love, and I encourage all those who feel competent and interested to try it because of the unlimited earning potential,"" said Wong.


""However,"" she warns, ""I must admit that statistics say that over half of the stockbrokers fail in their first year. A stockbroker needs to be not only knowledgeable but also a caring person about her clients. She should take care of her clients' investments as if her own. When clients ask me about investment strategies, I tell them they should first have a financial plan and invest only in high quality products. If they want to speculate, they should only speculate with money they can afford to lose,"" she advised.


Wong's children, a 15 year-old son and a 13 year-old daughter, are very supportive of her beloved field. In fact they have become so interested in the stock market that they even track their own stocks that mother Wong purchased for them. One of her goals in life is for her children to grow up to be happy and productive citizens. With a smile, Wong admits her other lifetime goal is to perhaps, someday have her own money management firm.


In the community, Josephine Wong is a member of the Santa Clara Society Institute of Certified Financial Planners, the Peninsula Stocks and Bonds Club as well as the Asian Business League Silicon Valley Chapter, Chi Am, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, DGS Alumnae, Inc. However her long, demanding hours at her job leaves little time for extra activities other than being with her family for golf and weekend trips, and a yearly jaunt to the Orient.


""My hobby is the stock market,"" she exclaims enthusiastically, ""and I am thinking of it constantly day and night. Because I have had such good fortune in the field and am enjoying myself so much working in the stock market with clients, I would be happy to give any advice to those who might be interested in entering their field, or even help the first time stock market investor,"" she adds.


Wong's enthusiasm for her job is overwhelming, and she encourages entrance into the market.


""There are tremendous opportunities for investments to make money out here today. To encourage interested Asians to get into investments in the stock market. I will be happy to hear from them and be willing to help them work out their financial portfolios no matter how large or small their investment plans,"" she said.


Of herself, Wong admits she has always been an extrovert. ""I have always loved people and am afraid I am one who talks everyone's head off so much so I'm just an open book to my friends,"" she explained.


Although she loves the work and will never retire, she concludes that the life of a stockbroker is filled with stress. ""All the hustle, bustle and maneuverings around you during the morning market hours is very draining, but when one has a satisified client it's worth all the worries and stress,"" said Wong.


Her clients in her Palo Alto office are, for the most part, Caucasian, so she encourages the many Asians new to the area to get in touch with her if they are interested in getting financial planning in the stock market.


On the political scene, she paused and wishfully said, ""I wish that Asians could be more united in their goals and expectations of each other. We have so much to offer and yet, oftentimes, get too busy in our own . . . goals to join each other in one common cause. Asians need united power to change things and now is the time to be more active politically. I personally hope we will see more Asians enter the political arena in the next decade.""

Negros Island the Phulippines is a land of stark contrasts. Many of the wealthiest of that country's land-owning elite live next to the poorest of the millions of working poor. Starvation haunts the homes of thousands of sugarcane workers while thousands of acres of prime agricultural land stand vacant on the giant sugar plantations of Negros.


Serge Cherniguin, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Sugarcane Workers (NFSW), based on Negros, described these conditions to church, labor and community groups in Seattle recently, as part of a West Coast speaking tour at the invitation of the Negros Food and Freedom Fund of Hawaii. He is explaining the emergency situation facing the sugarcane workers of Negros and appealing for sorely needed donations and assistance.


Cherniguin traces the current plight of sugarcane workers to the collapse of the Philippine sugar industry in 1984. At that time, world sugar prices dropped precipitously, resulting in massive unemployment on the sugar haciendas of Negros The effects were devastating on an island whose economy is completely dependent on a single, export-oriented crop. Employment in the sugar industry dropped rom a high of 1.8 million to 439,000 in a few short years with no other source of jobs available. Ironically, while both the sugar lands and sugar workers were idled by the collapse, the people have not been permitted to farm the vacant land for food. The result has been starvation in the midst of the Philippines richest farmland.


Even those who still hold jobs cannot make ends meet. The Philippines' minimum wage law was passed years ago, but it has never been enforced. By law, the minimum wage should be 32.5 pesos or about $1.50 a day, but on Negros, 90 percent of the workers are paid piecework rates, called the ""paquiao"" rate. Those who work for the ""paquiao"" rate, Cherruguin says, make 12 to 22 pesos or less than one dollar a day. And during the ""tiempo muerto"" (off-season) from May to September, no one has jobs in this seasonal industry.


Bad conditions are made worse. Cherniguin reports, by the presence of multinational corporations, primarily U.S., but also several Japanese firms. Multinationals effectively control the Philippine fertilizer, machinery, oil and finance industries, using this control to exploit Filipino labor and natural resources. Unfortunately, Cherniguin says, President Aquino and the government technocrats have yet to end foreign domination of the Philippine economy, an absolute necessity if the Filipino people are to achieve national independence and development that benefits all sectors of society.


The National Federation of Sugarcane Workers (NFSW) was founded in 1971 by a group of priests, seminarians and labor leaders. Massive organizing was going on throughout the Philippines in the years just prior to Marcos's declaration of martial law and the NFSW was formed to address the unique conditions of the sugar workers on Negros, Pro-management unions called ""yellow unions,"" were also established by the landowners to co-opt and divide the workers, but the NFSW has continued to grow. Today, the NFSW boasts a membership of over 80,000.


Organizing the sugar workers has not been an easy task. The first step, Cherniguin says, was to raise the awareness of the sugar workers, ""because their minds had been conditioned by generations of oppression and exploitation to accept the situation, to be thankful for the very little benefits they receive from the sugar planters. The responsiblity of the union was to awaken the sugar workers that they are human beings, that they have rights.""


The second step was to overcome the opposition 'of the sugar planters. ""The sugar planters of Negros,"" says Cherniguin,"" are one of the most elite in Philippine society, so wealthy, so haughty and imperious, so proud and very despotic."" They have used their wealth and power to buy off the labor courts, the police and the military and enlist their aid in suppressing union organizing activities. Cherniguin added.


""Many sugar workers have Jost their lives,"" Cherniguin reports, ""for simply demanding the implementation of the minimum wage law, a law that is already on the books."" Violence against the sugar workers and union organizers has increased recently with the rise of right-wing vigilante groups like Alsa Masa and the doubling of the military garrison on the island.


Like most other NFSW union organizers, Cherniguin knows his name appears on right-wing death lists. He shrugs when asked of it, saying, ""When you see the suffering of the people, the depth of poverty and hunger, you get so angry. As a Christian, you feel ashamed of so much injustice. You have to take action.""


Vigilante groups on Negros have even attacked the local Catholic church for its strong stand in support of the sugar workers and land reform. Several church schools and facilities have been razed, and an attempt was recently made to assassinate Bishop Antonio Fortich as he slept in a church compound. The church has stated, Cherniguin says, that ""the cry of the sugar workers and people of Negros for land reform is a sacred cry ... the church is willing to suffer with the people in their quest for land and will rise up with the people in triumph once genuine land reform is implemented.""


Land reform is perhaps the key question facing the Philippines today. President Aquino has just unveiled her program for land reform to the public but Cherniguin is not impressed. While it is intended to cover all lands, an improvement over previous programs. Congress must still implement it and decide how much land each landowner may retain outside the program.


Cherniguin feels this is a fatal flaw. The new Congress is dominated by traditional Philippine elites. A majority have spoken out against land reform even before debate has begun. Both the chair and vice chair of the land reform committee in Congress have close ties to the sugar planters of Negros. ""What was a promise of great hope for the people,"" he says, ""turned out to be a great frustration.""


The NSFW demands genuine land reform because only this can empower the 80 percent of the population that has been so impoverished. Only genuine land reform, Cherniguin maintains, can solve the ""peace and order question"" in Negros. For the NFSW, this means giving land to the landless, abolishing the hacienda system, and setting up workers cooperatives.


Cherniguin believes the main problems of the Philippines are economic not ideological. While government officials show interest only in the Philippines export capacity and Gross National Product, for 90 percent of the people, the first interest is food. And to have food, they must first have land. ""The people are hungry, they watch their children starve to death, they have no jobs, so they join the union to improve their lives,"" he said. ""Then their union is suppressed and even their churches attacked. People go to the hills because they have no alternative.""


In preparation for genuine land reform, the NFSW has initiated a Farmlot Program which sets up sugarworkers on borrowed land, provides farm supplies and teaches farming techniques. Organic farming methods are used, says Cherniguin, because Filipinos need to end their reliance on expensive fertilizers, pesticides and fuel provided by foreign multinationals.


Cherniguin hopes to build recognition and support for these projects that prepare Philippine sugarworkers to take control of their lives. He also appeals to the American people to look at the real problems of land reform and economic independence, stop the exploitation of Philippine resources and labor by U.S. multinationals, and halt U.S. military aid to the Philippines.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Last year 1000 people were screened for health problems, 20 indigent children received eye glasses, and 60-70 got blood pressure tests, thanks to the contributions of the Chinatown Lions Club.


This year the Lions hope to double the $2000 they raised in 1986 for the annual White Cane Days which they sponsor in conjunction with the International Lions Club.


The Lions members will solicit donations from local merchants, professionals, family associations, passersby on the street and the general public.


The club plans to set up booths in front of the Grand Palace Restaurant and Kow Loon Pastry at on Grant Avenue between Washington and Jackson Streets, and in front of American Asian Bank on the corner of Stockton Street and Jackson Streets to take contributions.


Contributions may also be sent by mail to Lion President Eddie Kwan, 1076 Stockton St., San Francisco, Ca. 94108.


Much of the money raised will go to North East Medical Services, which has used it in the past in its program to provide eye glasses to needy children, to make free medical tests available at the Health Fair it sponsors once per year, and to make blood pressure tests available, all year.


The Lions have also supported a special vision program at the Pacific Medical Center on Webster Street.


For this fundraising drive the club has enlisted the aid of Rose Queen Sharon Kwok and Miss Teenage Chinatown Leslie Sung.

Public figures are being humiliated over the concept of trust. Gary Hart, White House insiders, etc.


Trust is also important for Asian Pacific Americans in regard to community and political development.


Hearings began on the ""Iranamok over Contragate"" issues. Did President Reagan know what he should have about his key staff?


Do Americans believe him when he says that he wasn't paying attention to his job? If he was paying attention, then did he break the law?


Senator Daniel Inouye is trusted as an honest, competent statesman. The country feels safe with him leading the inquiry.


Gary Hart


The Democrats' top Presidential candidate destroyed his career in remarkable fashion. Associating with young people took on sinister overtones.


Why? The press felt that it revealed longtime extramarital activity. Somehow, Hart betrayed a public trust.


As columnists we were disappointed. We found Hart had relied on Asian Pacific supporters to develop a trans-Pacific trade platform that had considerable promise.


However, losers and their ideas have no friends


Community Trust


Hart was aloof from other politicians and the media. He actually challenged reporters to catch him ""cheating"" if they could. So they did.


Hart did not exactly violate political requirements. However, he never established trust with a particular community -- the press -- as he needed to. As a result an intelligently prepared Pacific trade policy is wasted.


The Asian Pacific American community loses.


Cross Cultural Trust


John Kennedy understood reporters and cooperated with them. They, in turn, decided his adventures weren't newsworthy. Press and politician understood and trusted each other.


Politicians, reporters, ethnic groups, neighborhoods, occupational groups, countries -- all have standards of conduct. Most of the standards are usually at an instinctual level.


Outsiders look in with puzzlement. Insiders become defensive. Understanding breaks down -- but how, when and why?


The key elements are trust and understanding.


Doing It Right


Our firm advises companies and governments on management and business matters.


For example, a company's service area changes. Chinese and Filipino families are moving in.


The marketing director is reluctant to risk offending prospective clients by approaching them inappropriately. It has happened to her colleagues.


We help her understand those communities. The company can soon offer products the A/P community appreciates. Trust can grow.


This same neighborhood delivered enough Chinese and Filipino votes to elect an underdog candidate -- Jackie Speier -- to the State Legislature last year. As a county official she had built trust and understanding with A/P constituents by responding to their problems.


Politics, business or neighborhood affairs. A/P residents appreciate and respond.


Doing It Wrong


In the same neighborhood we observed a disaster brewing.


A new neighbor was grilled at a homeowners association meeting. He was expanding his two-bedroom home. It would consume the back yard, add a third story, a second kitchen, and hold six bedrooms.


Neighbors filed permit appeals. They said it destroyed the character of the neighborhood and blocked their sunlight. The membership was sympathetic.


The would-be builder explained in a thick Chinese accent that when his parents came to visit, they needed a bedroom. Thus, four bedrooms more.


Nobody believed him.


He pointed out that he didn't violate neighborhood zoning codes.


An expert said that when the codes were revised, nobody conceived that anyone would build to that density, so it wasn't prohibited.


Six bedrooms or not, everybody feels upset.


The white-ethnic neighborhood felt its cultural norms were violated.


The newcomer -- there only five years -- apparently felt that by not violating the written law, he had no reason to consider his neighbors' wishes.


Like Hart and reporters, neither side considered the ""cultural values"" of the other parties. Neither side really realized what was going wrong.


When In Rome...


Trust is critically important to Asian Pacific Americans.


By living in two worlds day-by-day, we understand better what each world expects.


Changing neighborhoods and service areas can lead to cross-cultural misunderstandings. Or they can lead to new integrated opportunities.


If we in the A/P community can lead with our understanding, we can build trust even where hostility is more likely.


Rod McLeod


The mayor of San Francisco appointed Roderick McLeod, a Filipino American attorney, to a vacancy on the school board last week. That seat was vacated by another Fil-Am who had lost public trust.


The board is bitterly split; the A/P community supports the minority faction.


Mayor Dianne Feinstein instructed McLeod not to join either faction. She expects him to bridge the gaps.


Not all political differences are cultural, but McLeod must quickly learn which are and which are not. The number of Filipino schoolchildren is growing, and cross-cultural problems are brewing.


McLeod, a relative newcomer to politics, has big work ahead. The mayor and the A/P/community trust him. His real test will be how well he develops trust with other ethnic and cultural interests.


We trust Rod will serve with understanding.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A May 18 Supreme Court ruling expanding the scope of a 1866 civil rights act will have ""no significant effect"" on Asians, civil rights attorneys opined here Wednesday.


Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1981 which was passed in the aftermath of the Civil War is already among the laws most frequently used by Asians as well as blacks in racial discrimination suits, said Edwin Lee of the Asian Law Caucus.


The high court ruled that the law applies in suits against Caucasians by Jews, Arabs and Hispanics who are traditionally considered Caucasian.


""The opinion is that it doesn't affect Asians in any significant way,"" said Lee, after consulting with other civil rights experts familiar with the decision.


Justice Byron White who wrote the court's opinions in two cases involving lawsuits, one by an Iraqi, American and one by a Jewish group, noted that ""there is a common popular understanding that there are three major human races -- Caucasoid, Mongoloid and Negroid.""


""Many modern biologists and anthopologists, however, criticize racial classiciations as arbitrary and of little use in understanding the variability of human beings,"" White continued. ""The particular biological traits which have generally been choser to characterize races have been criticized as having little biological significance.""


The court found that the intent of the law was to encompass ""ancestory or ethnic characteristics.""

LOS ANGELES -- The view is getting clearer for some 1200 Philippine-trained optometrists in California who are awaiting passage of the legislation by Senate President Pro Tempore David Roberti (D-Hollywood/Burban) which will allow foreign-trained optometrists to take the state licensure examinations.


Last month the Roberti bill was approved on a unanimous vote 14-0 by the Assembly Health Committee, bringing the legislation one step closer to passage.


Some 100 Filipino optometrists led by Jessie Cahiwat of Los Angeles reallied for legislative support at the grounds of the state capitol.


Cahiwat expressed satisfaction with the Roberti bill which offers an alternative to the additional two-year education required of optometrists who acquired their education in the Philippines.


The bill, SB 1347, qualifies foreign-schooled optometrists to complete 600-hour ""supervised clinical internship with ophthalmologists or optometrists prior to taking the national and state board examinations.


""While the instruction in the Philippines is based on American books, the course takes only four years to complete there, as opposed to the six years here in the U.S."" according to Cahiwat, a graduate of the Manila Central University, one of only four Philippine institutions offering optometry.


Cahiwat came to the U.S. in the last '60s on a P-3 visa issued to professionals, but it was only upon arrrival here that she found out that her academic attainment from the Philippines was deemed insufficient.


Cahiwat said she was confident that the support of Assemblyman William Filante (R-Marin), an ophthalmologist, will end the optometrists' 16-year battle for equal opportunity.


She also cited the support of legislative assistants Maely Tom and Georgette Imura as instrumental in hurdling the key committee last Aug. 18. ""If not for them, I don't think the bill would get anywhere,"" she said.


Tom also commended Cahiwat and the California Optometrists Association for their unrelenting push for recognition. ""I've never seen such energy -- they were working like professional lobbyists,"" she lauded the Filipinos.

LOS ANGELES -- Actors have it tough. Asian American actors, who suffer from discrimination and stereotyping, have it even tougher, according to Randy Leong, administrator of the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists.


""There's a is more Asian Americans can contribute to movies than being actors in a Kung-Fu movie. Our goal is to be an . . . organization for actors and actresses and other people involved with . . . and film,"" said Leong, 32 who himself is a scriptwriter.


""We've noted that in the past some casting directors are discriminating against Asians by limiting them to parts for their specific ethnic origin. That's tantamount to categorizing white actors as suitable only for roles as Finglish, Irish or German.""


He said the 600-member organization was working with large corporation executives through its honorary and advisory boards in the hope that they can influence the entertainment industry to change some of its attitudes.


""Parts for Asian Americans are few and far between,"" Leong lamented. ""'The Last Emperor,' for instance, used mostly Asians from Asia. Our organization would like to see more Asian Americans from the U.S. being cast.""


The last TV show to feature Asian Americans as regulars on the cast, ""Gung-Ho,"" was short-lived.


""Those statistics from the Screen Actors Guild about actors making only $7500 on the average per year are true,"" said Leong, ""and even more true with Asian Americans because they continue to be discriminated against for many of the minor parts where it wouldn't matter if they were Asian or not.""


Many Asian American interested in TV and film . . . aiming for behind-the-camera work as well, said Leong, such as work in make-up, costuming, camerawork, special effects or screen.


There are also three well-known Asian American directors rising fast in Hollywood: Wayne Wang, Peter Wang and Steven Okazaki.


AAPAA holds an annual awards banquet in which it gives awards to producers and directors who have cast Asian Americans. Pat Morita, the actor star of ""Karate Kid"" won its most recent life-achievement award.


The 1988 awards presentation is scheduled for March 21 at the Beverly Hilton.


Writer's Workshop


Because there is opportunity behind the camera in writing. AAPAA has started a writer's workshop to develop screen writing skills of any members that are interested.


""Sometimes, when you have a literary property that a producer wants, you can name your own ticket -- such as wanting to be assistant director,"" said Leong. ""It doesn't happen very often but it's another way into the industry besides being an actor or actress and waiting for your agent to call with a part.""


AAPAA has an advocacy play called ""AAPAA Yours"" produced by Alvin Ing, which it frequently presents to show how prevalent stereotypes of Asians are.


AAPAA has a speaker's bureau that will send speakers to speak on issues of concern to Asian Americans.


Many or its members also serve as celebrity hosis and emcees at various community functions.


It also publishes a directory containing hundreds of pictures of Asian Americans actors and actresses with a short list of their specialines. For instance, under Willie Wong it lists that the speaks ""fluent Chinese and does gymnastics, martial arts and stunts."" This book is provided to all casting directors.


There are still some taboos that exist in the Hollywood movie world when at comes to depicting. As ans, said, Leong. For instance, . . . many movies have . . . Cancasian man with an . . . such as ""Yeat of the . . . shere are never movies made with an Asian American or Asian man paired with a white woman.


Even when Asian Americans or Asians are an essential part of the script, often they are depicted as more violent than the Caucasians in the same script, said Leong. For instance, in the movie ""China Girl,"" about two teenage lovers, an Italian American boy and Chinese American girl, it is the Chinese family that starts the killing, not the Italian American family.


According to Leong, the AAPAA is ""not a guild, Anybody interested in the film or TV business can join."" The address is: AAPAA, 1010 S. Flower St., #302, Los Angeles, CA 90015 or call (213) 745-7016.

Former California Supreme Court Chief Justice lashed out at Gov. George Deukmejian for refusing to nominate an Asian American to one of three vacancies on the high court's bench.


The vacancies came as a result of the state's voters ousting Bird and Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin last November.


Deukmejian last week announced his ""short list"" of six nominees for the three vacancies. One was a woman, one had an Hispanic surname and four were white males.


The nominees include Associate Justices John A. Arguelles and David N. Eagleson of the Second District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, San Diego County Superior Court Judge Patricia Benke, Associate Justice Hollis Best of the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Fresno, Associate Justice Marcus M. Kaufman of the Fourth District Court of Appeal in San Bernardino, and Associate Justice James B. Scott of the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco.


""I was disappointed to see, when the governor made his announcements and sent names for replacements, that he didn't have an Asian among the individuals. I thought that was rather sad,"" Bird told an audience Sunday in Los Angeles.


""It's the last barrier, having an Asian on the Supreme Court, one of the very last barriers we have in the state of California,"" Bird said.


Bird also sharply criticized Deukmejian for not trying to reflect the state's diversity in his nominations. She pointed out that four of the nominees are from the Long Beach area, the governor's home town.


The governor's choices were heartbreaking for the Asian American community, which had hoped to gain representation on the high court.


Dennis Wong, a long-time Republican leader of the Chinese American community in San Francisco, had joined an intense statewide lobbying campaign promoting Appellate Court Justice Harry Low, who is of Chinese heritage, for one of the three nominations.


""Gov. Deukmejian let down a lot of Asian Americans,"" Wong said. ""We had high hopes that he, being of Armenian descent, would know what it means for us to be represented. Having an Asian up there would have been a big boost for all Asian Americans in the state.""


Wong said he was not criticizing the individuals on the short list. ""Maybe politics have gotten better and a white man can represent a member of an ethnic minority. But it's been our experience that they don't always understand our problems.


Wong agreed with Bird that the six choices did not properly reflect the state's diversity.


""I am afraid the court will end up having a pretty myopic viewpoint -- it won't be able to see the whole picture. Having people from different backgrounds, from different regions, from different philosophies, can enhance the court.""

By American Citizens for Justice


Today marks one of the darkest days in the history of Asian Americans. The racist killer of Vincent Chin, Ronald Ebens, who brutally beat him to death with a baseball bat on June 19, 1982, will NEVER SPEND A SINGLE DAY IN JAIL! For all Asian Americans and anyone who believes in justice and equal treatment under law, there is great sadness and moral outrage.


Make no mistake ... Ronald Ebens killed Vincent Chin! Although a jury in Cincinnati, Ohio acquitted him of Federal Civil Rights charges, this fact will never change. He plead guilty to manslaughter and admitted to the brutal killing. Despite the countless contributions Americans of Asian ancestry have made to our society, our judicial system still treats us as second class citizens.


The acquittal should not be considered as a signal that racism, discrimination, and bigotry have ended against Asian Americans. To the contrary, it gives our community a clear indication that we have only begun the fight for justice! The ACJ and the Asian American community are committed to the cause of seeking the affirmation of our rights as American citizens.


Despite the loss of the civil rights prosecution, we view last week's setback as only temporary. Asian Americans have lived in this country for over 125 years. The Vincent Chin case only proves there are many challenges we face in order to reach our goal to be fully entitled members of society. The Vincent Chin case has been the focus of a nationwide consciousness raising by all Asian Americans and concerned citizens.


The ensuing dialogue and recognition of the problem of the dramatic increase in anti-Asian attitudes and violence through the Vincent Chin case only proves there are many challenges we face in order to reach our goal to be fully entitled members of society. The Vincent Chin case has been the focus of a nationwide consciousness raising by all Asian Americans and concerned citizens. The ensuing dialogue and recognition of the problem of the dramatic increase in anti-Asian attitudes and violence through the Vincent Chin case has made our four year fight for justice worth all the struggle our group and community has endured. We are only at the early stages of our agenda to become first class citizens.


People of conscience in the Detroit area, the state of Michigan, the United States, and internationally, have recognized the significance of the Vincent Chin case and rallied behind the cause. For the many groups and individuals who have supported Mrs. Lily Chin's struggle, you have our eternal gratitude. Mrs. Chin has asked us to extend her personal thanks to her supporters for these past five years.


Mrs. Chin, the ACJ and the Asian American community wish to extend our since sincere thanks to the U.S. Department of Justice, Bill Soisson and Floyd Clardy, the DOJ attorneys who tried the case, Jerry Craig of the FBI, and the members of the DOJ staff who worked tirelessly on the case. They did their duty to the best of their ability, and for that Mrs. Chin and the Asian American community throughout the country owe them a debt of gratitude. Special thanks should be given to Liza Chan. Without her unselfish effort to investigate the case, the DOJ would never have considered a civil rights prosecution.


We must never forget the circumstances which gave rise to the brutal killing of Vincent Chin. Throughout history, whenever society has had economic, social, or political difficulties, the typical reaction has been to target a group of people to blame for that problem. Time and again, Americans of Asian ancestry have been the scapegoat for the ills of society. THIS MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!


""In today's atmosphere of trade tensions between the United States and countries of the Pacific rim, Asian Americans have been and continue to be singled out as targets of the frustration all Americans share. Asians, as with any ethnic group which comprises the American melting pot, suffer when there is an adverse impact on society. Asian Americans suffer along with everyone else when our country faces these difficult times. It is this lack of understanding of the needs, and failure to be sensitive towards Asian American concerns which allows the Ronald Ebens of the world to go free for their crimes and racism to be perpetuated.


The ACJ is committed to the fight for justice for Asian Americans. Being true to our organization's constitution, we will continue to advocate against racial prejudice and discrimination, and seek vigorous enforcement of our human rights. We will continue our efforts to outreach to other groups and individuals who believe in an American that treats all of its citizens equally. We will promote mutual understanding through educating the public regarding Asian American issues and concerns. We will not stop our fight for justice until racism and bigotry against all citizens has been eliminated.


Even as we speak today, issues such as the ""English only"" law, employment discrimination, discrimination in education, defamation and stereotyping of Asians in the media, and the ominous threat of anti-Asian violence and sentiment, still confront the Asian American community and the ACJ. We fully intend to follow through our commitment to open the Asian American Center for Justice in the Detroit area to serve the Asian American community by providing support for individuals who seek redress through our govern-ment and judicial systems, monitor and combat anti-Asian violence and sentiment, and to create a valuable resource that our community can turn to for assistance.


The Vincent Chin Case is not an end, it is just the beginning of the Asian American community's efforts to take our position as fully recognized members of society. There is no way we can bring Vincent Chin back to life. He has made the ultimate sacrifice in order to uphold human dignity. However, the inspiration of the seeking of justice has given the Asian American com-munity hope for the future ... For that, the fight for Justice for Vincent Chin will never end.


American Citizens for Justice is a Detroit-based coalition os Asian Americans promoting the civil rights of Asians in America. The Vincens Chin case was the impetus of the formation of AC in 1984.

LOS ANGELES -- A State Assembly committee March 27 held a hearing on University of California admission policies as they affect Asians.


The two-hour hearing at California State University, Los Angeles by the Subcommittee on Higher Education, was aimed at proposed changes in a resolution by the Legislature directing the UC system to strive for a student population that reflects the ethnic makeup of the state's high school graduating classes.


The resolution has come into question recently because Asians are ""overrepresented"" in the UC system by comparison to high school graduates, and some Asians have charged that the university is imposing secret quotas limiting the admission of Asians.


Prof, Ling-Chi Wang, chair of the Asian American Studies Program at UC Berkeley; Ron Wakabayashi, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League; Dan Nakanishi, UCLA Asian American Studies Center's associate director; and Derick Hong, UCLA Asian Student Coalition director, criticized current UC admissions policy.


Dr. William Frazier, senior vice president of academic affairs; Ed Apodaca, director of admissionas and outreach services; Bud Travers, UC Berkeley assistant vice chancellor for undergraduate affairs; Winston Doby, UCLA vice chancellor of student affairs; and Rae Lee Siporin, UCLA admissions office director, gave the university's position.

One year after the Filipino people toppled a dictator, the question many Filipinos have often asked -- Where are we headed? -- seems to have been finally answered.


During the early months of her presidency, Cory Aquino appeared headed in the right direction. She released some political detainees, including so-called hardcore communists. The Presidential Committee on Human Rights was formed to look into human rights violations of the former regime. She promised a progressive labor program in her Labor Day speech last May. She even appointed liberal democrats to her cabinet. She publicly promised to disband paramilitary units, creating a sigh of relief especially among those in the countryside.


But Aquino's progressive image began to disintegrate as she personally appointed rich businessmen and landed people to draft the recently-ratified constitution. The constitution has a strong bill of rights and human rights provisions (a reaction perhaps to 15 years of dictatorship) but fails to chart fundamental political, economic and social reforms. Many controversial matters, such as the issue of land reform and U.S. military bases, are left for Congress to resolve. To ensure that the Congress-to-be is controlled by traditional politicians and bureaucrats, the Aquino government banned the cause-oriented Partido ng Bayan (People's Party) from this May's election.


The pro-worker Labor Day speech of Aquino has remained without the force of the law. Workers' rights continue to be violated in the interests of ""a favorable climate for foreign investment."" Strikes and picket lines remain unprotected from military atrocities. As an example, on January 31 a military attack on KMU strikers at the Bataan Export Processing Zone left two people killed and 34 injured.


In the realm of economics, Aquino believes the government should honor all foreign debts, liberalize all restrictions on imports and dismantle the narrow protectionist measures enjoyed by local industries so as to facilitate the massive influx of foreign goods. The government also intends to continue the implementation of the Basic Agro-Industrial Development Strategy leading the government to cooperate with foreign capital in exploiting the country's natural resources. These are the same economic policies that the International Monetary Fund-World Bank imposed on Marcos, and the result was economic disaster.


Despite the much acclaimed ""democratic space,"" human rights violations are again on the rise as proven by the killings of labor leader Rolando Olalia and sugar worker organizer Feliciano Reyes of Laguna, the shooting of Espiridion Sabal in Cebu and the massacre of 19 peasants in front of the presidential palace last January 22.


No less than former Senator Jose Diokno, chairman of the Philippine Committee on Human Rights, resigned his post to protest the massacre. Others who quit were former Supreme Court Justice Jose B.L. Reyes, Zenaida Quezon Avancena, Sister Mariani Dimaranan and Antonio Quintos. In their letter of resignation, they said the Aquino government's ""pronouncements for human rights have not been validated by its action on certain incidents.""


Meanwhile, the military, despite its ""new image,"" continues to brutalize the population with the formation of rightist death squads such as the Alsa Masa in Davao, Sukol in Cebu and the Revolutionary Army of the Masses-Armed Cadre Team in Metro Manila. Government-supported fanatical groups such as the Sagrada Corazon Senor and the Padayon Demokrasya Institusyon Pilipinas in Mindanao have been rearmed for counterinsurgency operation. Two days after the end of the ceasefire agreement last February 8, soldiers from the 14th Infantry Battalion were reported to have massacred 18 civilians, including six children, in Lupao, Nueva Ecija on suspicion of being New People's Army sympathizers.


Even conservative religious groups are, proliferating in the country. One example is CAUSA, the political arm of the Unification Church, which has reportedly aided the Contras in Nicaragua. Last October, CAUSA held a conference on national security in the Manila Hotel. Among the participants were former Minister of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile, Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Fidel Ramos, retired U.S. Army Major General John Singlaub and former CIA officer Ray Cline.


The sweet-talking Aquino fits perfectly well into the plan of the U.S. to have a popular government that will protect U.S. economic and military interests in the Philippines. It cannot be denied that U.S. multinational corporations were behind the ouster of pro-worker labor minister Augusto Sanchez.


It cannot also be denied that U.S. military advisers are behind the government's new counterinsurgency strategy known as Low Intensity Conflict which ""shifts counterrevolutionary warfare to the grassroots level."" The ""unequivocal and firm support"" that Cory Aquino got from U.S. officials during her September visit to the U.S. signalled the beginning of full support to the Aquino government by the U.S.


Aquino, on the other hand, has started consolidating her government by installing a pro-U.S. cabinet, appointing a pro-U.S. Minister of Defense and Armed Forces Chief of Staff, and calling an election in May. Through these normalization measures, the U.S.-Aquino regime hopes to continue U.S. domination and feudal rule in the Philippines, which have brought years of misery to Filipinos.


Recent events in the Philippines, from the massacre of the peasants to the government's intransigence in the peace talks that collapsed, showed which side is earnestly seeking peace. The Filipinos want peace. But peace that is based on justice.

Presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson ""is far and away the best candidate on issues important to Asians and Pacific Islanders"" a California supporter told a gathering in Seattle earlier this month.


Alan Nishio, Southern California co-chair of Asians and Pacific Islanders for Jesse Jackson and chairperson of the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations, spoke at a November 4 reception to kick off the efforts of the newly-formed Seattle Chapter of Asians and Pacific Islanders for Jesse Jackson.


Nishio, who works as assistant vice president for student affairs at California State University at Long Beach, compared the struggle for monetary redress for Japanese Americans interned during World War II with Jesse Jackson's candidacy. Both, he said, are struggles for basic justice and reflect the enormous gains people can achieve by acting together for what they believe is right.


Nishio spoke in Seattle several weeks after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill to pay $20,000 in monetary compensation, to each living internee, an accomplishment thought impossible 10 years ago when Congressman Mike Lowry introduced the first redress bill.


Nishio said passage of the redress bill was made possible, in part, by the efforts of a group of California Nisei and Sansei who journeyed to Washington, D.C. to lobby House members. Nishio said that one member of the group, a veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, met with a Florida Congressman, also a veteran, and ultimately persuaded him to change his vote from no to yes. That same Congressman, in turn, convinced others in the Florida delegation to vote in favor of the bill, Nishio said.


At the recent convention of the National Democratic Council for Asians and Pacific Islanders in Los Angeles, Jackson was the most well received candidate, Nishio said.


As a candidate Nishio said, Jackson has tied the recent wave of anti-Asian violence to the greed of American corporations exporting jobs abroad. Similarly, Jackson has spoken out against the rising tide of American protectionist trade sentiment against Asian countries and has advocated, in its place, efforts to bolster the economies of Asian countries to help them attain self-sufficiency.


Nishio discounted claims that Jackson cannot win either the nomination or the general election. In fact, a Time magazine poll conducted in September showed that Jackson was by far the best known candidate and the first choice of 26 percent of all Democrats, 15 percent higher the Michael Dukakis, his closest challenger.


Nishio stressed the need to expand the number of voters and raise the consciousness of voters, especially those ignorant of how Jackson's promise of peace, justice and jobs can help all Americans. The wisdom of Nishio's advice is borne out by the fact that Reagan won the presidency in 1984 with only 65 million votes to Mondale's 35 million. But over 85 million eligible voters did not vote in the election.


The Seattle Chapter of Asians and Pacific Islanders for Jesse Jackson will hold a public education forum on the Jackson candidacy on Saturday. November 21 at 2 p.m. in the basement of the Bush-Asia Center at 409 Maynard Ave. S. A video presentation of Jackson's recent speeches will be on the program. For more information, call Stan Shikuma at 329-0172 or Gary Huie at 625-5118.


The group hopes to plan future events on voter registration drives, seek endorsements from local community groups, and hold informal house meetings to discuss Jackson's candidacy.

As a youngster, Sumi Tonooka was described as a ""Renaissance Child"" and a ""jack-of-all trades."" Her mother feared she would become a ""master of none."" Sumi is now a Renaissance woman and a master jazz pianist.


Sumi, who will turn 31 in October, is on the brink of stardom. A warm and quietly vibrant woman, she has gained recognition and critical acclaim in a field in which very few women succeed. Talent and ability are not enough to ""make it"" in the competitive, male-dominated world of jazz music. Sumi has learned that relentless determination, and an ability to overcome adversity, discrimination and rejection are essential for success.


""What it comes down to, is that you really have to have a strong sense of self. You are constantly being challenged to prove that you have a strong sense of self. Self-respect and believing in what you are doing is essential. You have to believe that what you are doing is good and you have to work on knowing what it is you want musically,"" she explains.


This is especially important for women, Sumi stresses, because women jazz musicians have a much harder time gaining respect. She says that ""People don't take you seriously, sometimes even after they've heard you play. Jazz is a very aggressive, male-dominated kind of music and there are some aspects that are very macho. When you're a woman, you are not really brought up to deal with things like that. You somehow have to learn how to deal with those kinds of attitudes and figure out how you can make them work for you.""


""Sumi has synthesized her musical and personal experiences to work for her. She is one of four children born to a Japanese mother and black father in an integrated neighborhood in Philadelphia. When she was 13, her parents took her to see Thelonious Monk for her birthday, ""and I decided that if I was going to be a musician, I would be a jazz musician.""


Before she graduated from high school, at 15, she went to Boston to visit Berklee and the New England Conservatory of Music colleges. She didn't feel that college was the right atmosphere to learn jazz, so whe took four years off and began to play professionally with such artists as Philly Joe Jones.


When she was 19, she enrolled at the Philadelphia College of Performing Arts and studied piano with Susan Starr.


""She was a great classical teacher. People came from all over the work to study with her. She was the first woman musician I ever saw. I was 10 years old. I remember being very impressed with this little woman who had such a big sound. I worked with her for four years and she got me into dealing with the piano as an instrument and technique in a whole different way,"" Sumi remembers.


As she grows professionally as a jazz artist, Sumi's name has been mentioned with the likes of Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Bobby McFerrin and Stanley Jordan. However, Sumi feels that jazz musicians as a whole don't get the respect they deserve.


She admits that sometimes, ""it can be ungratifying, because you don't get treated the same way as other musicians. The great jazz musicians don't get the same respect as the great classical musicians. It's a shame, because there really is no difference. In a way, I feel that jazz musicians are more creative -- especially if they are improvising -- because they create on the spot.""


After years of struggling and paying her dues, Sumi is able to experience the benefits that come with gaining respect and recognition as a jazz pianist. She has a strong following in New York, where she currently lives, and has performed at various well-known clubs including the Blue Note and the Village Gate. In addition, she has recently released her first album, ""With An Open Heart,"" which she produced herself.


She admits that producing the album ""was a lot of work and aggravation, and I went through a lot of pain, but it's mine. Now I know what it feels like to have creative control over your own product. A lot of what I feared was true -- putting out your own album takes you away from the music. You're so busy doing all the business stuff, it becomes hard to keep at the music. I would rather just practice, play, write music, do gigs and not worry about the business stuff, but that's unrealistic. Having that business knowledge and knowing how it all works can really help your career.""


Her mother has always encouraged a love for music and continues to play a significant role in Sumi's life. In a feminist and matriarchal decision, Sumi uses her mother's maiden name, Tonooka, instead of her legal name, Morris. Sumi says, ""I like the name Tonooka, which is unusual even in Japan, and I wanted to perpetuate it.""


Sumi was recently awarded a grant by the Japanese American Cultural Organization to write a triptych based on her mother's incarceration at Manzanar. The first movement of the piece will feature traditional Japanese instruments such as the kyoto and the shakuhachi and will represent the Issei generation. The second movement will combine Eastern and Western music and represent the Nissei generation. The third movement, ""will be jazzy, upbeat and modern to represent the Sansei generation.


""The experience of the camp didn't really affect me, except through my mother. It was very traumatic for her and she couldn't even talk about it until I was an adult. I think my mother spend a lot of my childhood years being invisible as an Asian. The idea for the piece was to somehow reflect the feeling and emotions of those who went through it,"" Sumi explains.


Sumi has completed the first movement, but is still in the process of finishing the piece. She is very anxious to complete the project, ""because the guy who backed my album is very hot on this idea of doing a video. It'll be me talking to my mother, talking about why I want to do the piece, filming it being performed and interviewing me about the process of writing it.""


Although she believes it will be difficult, Sumi would like to balance her career with a family. She has been married for a year and a half to graphic designer, Harry Bates, and has already started to think about having children.


""I really would like to have children and I think it will be very tough to balance with my career, but it helps to have a good partner, someone who believes in sharing the reponsibilities. I don't plan to do it very soon, because I want to wait until I'm more secure financially. It would be a compromise as far as time and energy is concerned, but I know it's possible,"" she said.


Sumi has already accomplished a great deal in her field, and her dreams and goals are not unlike many other musicians. ""I would love to be able to travel and tour with my own group. I would like to leave a body of work where people know that it's my music. I would like to develop my own personal style, to make an impact or some kind of statement with my music. Everyone strives for individuality, but that's a lifetime goal not something that happens over-night,"" she explains.


Among women jazz musicians, Sumi looks to Mary Lou Williams as her role model, ""mostly because of her love for music. It was her whole life and that's what she was about. I studied with her for about three months. She didn't teach you formally, it was just being around her, watching her play and having her watch you play. I thought she was really remarkable -- she was very strong and had a great sense of humor.""


Sumi plays and creates for one reason: she simply loves music. ""That, to me, is the most important thing. I play because I think music has a certain amount of healing ability -- it can affect people in a positive way. I like having that affect on people. Being able to move people, that's what I strive for.""

The Rainier Valley Enterprise Center, the first ""business incubator"" in the Seattle-King County area, is helping small businesses overcome the pitfalls that usually cause their quick demise.


Jackie Lum, general manager of the Center, said approximately 60 to 80 percent of all new small businesses fail within five years. Two problems contribute to the high failure rate: insufficient capital and lack of business management experience.


The concept of a business incubator is simple. To help small businesses succeed, provide them a shared facility to house their operations and offer shared resources -- including secretarial support, management consultation and marketing services -- so that they can have a nurturing environment in which to grow.


""We're not in the business of starting up businesses,"" Lum said. ""But we are in the business of ensuring that new businesses survive and grow.""


The Rainier Valley Enterprise Center, located in the CX Corporation building on Rainier Avenue, opened last September. The Center was initiated as a project of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and the City of Seattle.


The Center currently houses six businesses, but hopes to push that number to 15 to 20 by the end of the year, Lum said. The focus is on attracting light manufacturing companies and serving minority and women business owners.


Tenants -- businesses no more than two years old -- must lease a minimum of 500 square fee of space. But, in exchange, the Center provides many shared services: secretarial support, photocopying, four conference rooms, a cafeteria, a security parking garage, business management consultation, assistance with loan applications and marketing services.


Eventually tenants, after building up their operations, would move out of the incubator to make way for new tenants.


Although the Rainier Valley Enterprise Center is the first business incubator in Seattle, incubators have started up in Everett, Spokane and Kent, Lum noted.


""Once this project gets financially self-sufficient, we would look at starting up business incubators in other areas in Seattle,"" Lum said.""


For more information about the Center, call Lum at 721-2070.

Thomas Hom and his brother, Dr. Allen Hom, having been trying to establish a new UHF television station in Seattle for the past four years. After finally receiving a construction permit last year, their new station will be on Channel 45. They are currently conducting a feasibility study to determine the viewing audience they hope to capture.


Thomas Hom, board chairman for San Diego Television, Inc., which owns KITY Channel 69 in San Diego, hopes to model Channel 45 after the San Diego station. Channel 69 offers ""classic syndicated shows and movies."" Hom said. The station monitors the major VHF stations and offers what he calls ""counterprogramming"" -- showing a classic movie when the other stations are broadcasting the news. It will also ""cater to different ethnic groups."" Hom said, with programming such as foreign movies with captions or dubbed-in voices, if demographic studies show there is an audience for them.


Hom said programming for his station will be ""what the big networks cannot pull off,"" including special coverage of news and sports events. UHF is similar to what FM radio stations used to be, he explained. With specialized programming, they started off small, but now dominate the radio airwaves.


Six to 10 percent of the viewing audience is the niche we're looking for,"" Hom said. ""Seattle is the 13th largest market in the nation, which is a very important market. Anytime a city is among the top 25 national markets, that's a big market. You can make very good money if you reach at least five percent of the viewing audience, which means two to three million dollars in Seattle.""


Hom, who lives in San Diego, and his brother Allen in Seattle have spent most of the last four years trying to obtain permission from the Federal Communications Commission to begin operation of Channel 45. Hom said he and his brother were swamped with reports, hearings, ""a lot of material and close to a quarter of a million dollars in attorneys' fees.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Francisco Lions Club, Ocean City Restaurant and On Lok Senior Health Services are sponsoring a ""Little Ambasador"" talent show and dinner Sunday Jan. 17 at Ocean City Restaurant in Chinatown.


The event, which begins at 6 p.m. will feature performances by local children aged five through eight, and proceeds will go to On Lok Senior Health Services.


Eddie Kwan, vice president of the Lion's Club, said there is still time for youngsters to try out for the talent show. Interested children accompnied by their parents should meet at Ocean City Restaurant this Saturday from 9 p.m. to noon.


""It's a great opportunity for young children to perform and give at the same time,"" said Kwan. ""We want to encourage little ones in the community through this program to respect seniors and give them love. Sometimes they get lost in the American society but we want to say that they are very fortunate to have their families and respect them,"" Kwan added.


Kwan said organizers will accept 30 children to participate in the competition and that top winners will receive trophies and money scholarships donated by San Francisco Thrift and Loan, in the Richmond district and the Kowloon Bakery on Grant Avenue.


""There will also be a lot of recognition for the Little Ambassadors because they will be invited to participate in the Chinese New Year Parade and the Miss Teenage Chinatown pageant,"" said Kwan.


Tickets for the Little Ambassador talent show and dinner can be purchased at Ocean City Restaurant, 644 Broadway, S.F. at $30 for a donor and $50 for a sponsor. For more information call Eddie Kwan at 598-5685.

A heliport will be constructed just south of the Kingdome for a helicopter shuttle service between Seattle and Portland that will begin operation around the second week in June, an executive from the service told a gathering of the Chinese Chinatown Chamber of Commerce last week.


Jeffrey McClure, executive vice president of Air Shuttle Inc., said his firm's shuttle service between the central business districts of Seattle and Portland will enable business executives to travel between the two cities in less than 45 minutes, avoiding all the time wasted in getting to and from the airport.


""Once you're picked up all you have to worry about is what you're going to do after you get there,"" McClure said. ""The idea behind this is, 'Time is money.'""


Air Shuttle has already received permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin the service and has negotiated a contract to construct the Seattle heliport near the Kingdome, on Royal Brougham Way, between Third Avenue and Occidental Avenue.


McClure assured Chamber representatives that the helicopters will not fly over the International District or create noise for District residents. The helicopters -- advanced, twin-engine Aerospatiale Pumas -- are ""silent mode"" helicopters, he said. ""They are quieter than a Burlington Northern freight train or a truck on a freeway,"" McClure said.


McClure said Air Shuttle will begin its service with two helicopters, providing 16 flights a day, eight flights from each city. The first flight will leave Seattle at 7 a.m. and the last flight will arrive in Seattle at 6 p.m., he said. The service will run five days a week.


Each helicopter will accommodate 17 passengers, who will be provided with executive coach service.


Air Shuttle, through an agreement with American Messenger Service, will also provide two-hour express delivery of packages between Seattle and Portland, McClure said. The service especially useful for ""time-critical documents,"" will cost $40 per package, he added.

Kicker


St. Louis Cardinal kicker John Lee had to sit out the last part of the season after, as he put it, ""Just a freaky accident. It just happened. Someone cut my Knee out basically."" He is recuperating now from arthroscopic surgery.


Asian Pacifics are few and far between in the NFL, so young people in the community probably don't often dream of growing up to be a pro since they haven't many role models. And non-Asian seldom think of Asian Pacifics as athletes.


When John Lee was a freshman at UCLA, his team went to play in the Rose Bowl at Pasadena. The security guard wouldn't let him in. Of the incident, Lee recalled, ""It was kind of funny because the security man had never seen an Asian football player before. I could understand it."" He said his teammates laughed it off and that it was a matter of making a name for himself. After that he didn't have any problems getting into stadiums. ""Now I don't have any problems getting into stadiums. ""Now I don't have any problems because people know that there's an Asian in the NFL,"" he added.


Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea and came to the United States in 1976. He parents did not think seriously about a football career for Lee and didn't pay close attention when he played football at his Southern California high school, but when he went to UCLA they really got involved. Unlike many Asian parents, they did not press him to go into a traditional occupation as did his sisters (pharmacy and law) and his brother (chemical engineering).


Lee, who majored in sociology and business, said the best shot for him was to be involved in football. ""The money is definitely there. I would be a stupid fool not to take advantage of this golden chance because I believe you better get the money while you can, then a few years down the road I could come back and get a nine to five job if I want to.""


The former UCLA gridiron star said of his transition to the pros with the Cardinals, ""It's different after UCLA. We had a winning tradition there. But here we lost 10 games already, tied one; we only won two games. It's really a big shock to me ... It was a tough first year for me. I started out very slow and finally got back on the right track, and this injury came and I found I can't play for the rest of the season. I just learned a lot. So next year I'm going to be fresh and go at it again."" The team ended its season 4-11-1.


Football careers seldom last as long as Jim Plunkett's, who just completed his sixteenth season, so Lee and his father plan to become partners in real estate investments. He said his father is getting older and that he would like to let him rest, and he would take over. Lee laughed with some discomfort when asked whether all the attention from groupies was fun, saying, ""Some people can associate with them. Some can't. I'm not the kind of guy that could associate with them. That's just not my thing. I like to have a lot of privacy. That's the number one thing. I really enjoy that."" What he does consider fun is playing golf, and he likes playing guitar and listening to rock and roll.


At one time, when one pictured a football player, people like Fran Tarkenton, Lyle Alzado, John Riggins, Roosevelt Grier, Lynn Swann, or Dick Butkus came to mind. Now, not only are there Pacific Asian cheerleaders, but there are Pacific Asians playing in the NFL. High school students in Southern California were always aware of the outstanding Samoan Americans on their teams, but fans outside California seldom saw Pacific Islander players.


The Korean American kicker is cognizant of the barriers people of color face and feels they have to be practical and work through the difficulties of pursuing non-traditional roles. Asian Pacifics can look to Lee as one of their positive role models, and his playing in the National Conference gives mainstream Americans a chance to see a high profile Asian as a person in a light different from the usual sterotypes. Best of all, Asian Pacifics have an hero on Sunday afternoon television they can cheer.


And maybe, John, your groupies will soon be able to get a poster of you?!? At any rate, your fans wish you a fast recovery while you spend the next three months at your home in Southern California and look forward to . . . you make many conversions this Fall for the Cardinals.

This is a yearly treat that I always look forward to. A 90-minute delight, award-winning cartoons from nine different countries.


One of more interesting films in this year's show is Jane Aaron's ""Academy Leader Variations."" The title refers to the technical name for the familiar countdown that rides through a reel of film at the beginning to cue the projectionist. Twenty animators from China; the U.S., Poland, Switzerland, etc., were given assignment to come up with their own variations of this familiar theme. The Chinese team had the familiar characters from the Monkey King fable do the countdown, 10, 9, 8, etc. It looks like a Pekinese ""Sesame Street"" segment.


Also on the program is Juliet Stroud's ""Snookles,"" about a baby dragon and a little bird, that has a pnnchline reminiscent of the legendary, ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" This film has a musical score by Sachiko Sato, a little flute . . . that gives atmosphere to the ""tragic"" end of this 2 1/2 minute anecdote.


Other highlights are: ""The Frog, The Dog and the Devil"" (New Zealand), made by Bob Stenhouse and based on an old folk song: ""Break"" (USSR), a Clay animation film by Garri Bardin, witty glasnost-oriented response to ""Rocky IV."" And two British films, Joanna Quino's ""Girls Night Out,"" a funny, poignant look at bored working-class housewives at a male striptease show, And ""Carnival,"" a Picassoesque look at a Latin-American Mardi Grass.


This show is a must see for anyone who loves animated cartoons or for anyone who wants to see an alternative to what passes for it on American kids' TV.

Oral histories are fascinating because everyone has a story to tell. In ""Bitter Melon: Stories from the Last Rural Chinese Town in America,"" present and former residents or bocke, California tell stories of their lives in the former all-Chinese town, built by Chinese. ""Bitter Melon"" is a book of oral histories compiled by Jeff Gillenkirk and James Motlow (University of Washington Press, 1987).


This handsome book is filled with duotone photographs taken by James Motlow, a non-Chinese resident of Locke who, over time, gained enough acceptance from the Chinese residents that they permitted him to photograph them. However, the interviewees themselves provided the best pictures -- depicting life's celebrations such as weddings and children.


The introduction by Sucheng Chan describes the significance of Locke, California, built and inhabited exclusively by the Chinese until recent years. The Chinese originally migrated to California to mine for gold, but then turned to farming as a more steady source of income. The completion of the first transcontinental railroad also left many Chinese available for construction projects such as the laborious swampland reclamation and levee building in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where Locke is located.


The Delta was mostly marshland, and levees had to be built before the soil could be safely cultivated. Additionally, the peat sod had to be broken up with hand tools before it could be plowed. This unpleasant and unhealthy work was taken up by the Chinese. Many of them stayed in the Delta and in 1915, a group of immigrants from the Zhongshan area of southern China built their own town in the Delta called Locke. Locke provided a home for the Chinese, as well as a refuge from vielence and discrimination by whites.


The book features stories of 13 former and present residents of Locke, including the son of the town's co-founder, Chinese bachelors, an American born Chinese woman who married a Delta tenant farmer and a second generation Chinese man born in Locke. Some of the interviews were conducted in Chinese and translated into English. The elderly fell stories of their arrival in America, of laborious work for meager earnings, and of olden days when Locke bustled with commerce and not-so-illustrious activities such as gambling and prostitution which attracted visitors.


The residents also speak of the low cost of living in Locke and what a great place it was to rear children. They reflect on their lives vanished dreams, personal successes and hope for their children.


On the subject of arranged marriages, Tommy J. King opines. ""There's damned few love marriages, you know. Unless they really don't want to go through with it for some damned reason they, take what they get. They're taught that way, you know. That's the culture."" Suen Hoon Sum explains why he never married: ""You can't get married without money. I never wanted to anyway. I didn't know how to speak English, so if I brought someone over here from China, she'd have to suffer like I did and work just as hard.""


Bing Fai Chow, now in his 70s and past of the Chinese bachelor society, did not want to come to America, but says he has no regrets about his decision.


""My family wanted me to come and help my brother out -- to work and send money back to China...It's a matter of what your own family wants you to do,"" Chow said. ""At that time, there were very few choices you could make for yourself. I came here thinking I'd be able to go to school. But once I got here I never could, because of the discrimination. I didn't have any friends, and I kept thinking that life would have been easier in China.""


Others like to Lung were indifferent about leaving China.


""China, here, all the same, no difference,"" he said. ""You work hard over here, too. You work and toil for maybe 10, 12 hours a day over here. The pay was 75 cents a day, for a 10-hour day. Seventy-five cents to a dollar. Whether you like it or not didn't matter, You do the job and you have to do it no matter what. A job is a job.""


For the early immigrants, work was hard and limited to manual labor due to the language barrier and the lack of education. However, for the second generation, life offered more opportunity. Ping Lee, born in 1917 in Locke, is the unofficial mayor of Locke and proprietor of a super-market near Locke. He was able to attend college, and graduated with a degree in economics and business administration with the financial support of his father, who opened a restaurant during Ping's last year in high school. Ping's father was 65 at that time. Ping recognizes the advantages provided to him.


""I have a wonderful life,"" Ping Lee noted. ""I can't compare myself with these old people. (in Locke). You know I love them all. Just go down the street and ask them...As far as the old people is, I should do better than them. I have the education. They don't know the American language. I do. I went though college. I ran a store for 40 some-odd years. I worked hard at it. It's not all in vain because I'm very happy.


""Like my father said, the trees are all cut down now, you can see the light. You can walk easier. That's true. I didn't have it quite as hard as my father. My father did open the forest for me. He may not be too successful chopping the trees down, but I chopped them all down. He had to show me where they all were at first. He didn't chop them down but I did. So that's all right.""


While most of the interviewees were middle-aged or elderly, a couple of young persons were included in the collection of oral histories. Perhaps one reason why so few young people were included is that only four or five Chinese American adults under 40 live in Locke today. Most of the younger Chinese Americans have left Locke for better opportunities.


Although ""Bitter Melon"" memorializes the stories of former and current residents of Locke, the stories could have been about any Chinese person living in America, which, in itself, is always interesting subject matter. Nonetheless, what makes ""Bitter Melon"" special is the little-known history of Locke and its significance to Chinese American history.

Until now, many minority business people who wished to get ahead had little choice but to initiate their own enterprises. Yet, it's getting tougher, not easier, in many respects for minority businesses to succeed. Nationally, the size of the average corporation is growing. Meanwhile, the number of self-owned businesses has decreased an astonishing 55 percent in the last three decades.


Local minority businesses which find it difficult to operate in this increasingly competitive climate have a new ally: IMPACT, a private management consulting firm with a record of working with minorities in Salt Lake City and Portland. IMPACT's advantage: its low cost. Operating under a contract award from the Department of Commerce, IMPACT charges minority firms as little as $10 an hour for its consulting services.


IMPACT works with large and small business concerns. When Chisu Omari, owner of NW Earth, a T-shirt company which utilizes Native American artwork, needed help, IMPACT helped her focus on a market.


""IMPACT made me realize that I would lose money competing against low-cost Indian imprinted T-shirts,"" Omari says. However, her quality-designed products had virtually no competition on the high end. She is now enjoying new success in museums, mail order catalogs and public institutions. IMPACT even helped Omari secure government funds to finance half the printing costs of her new marketing advertising campaign.


IMPACT also advised Omari to find out her true cost of running a business. According to Jay Takemura, director of IMPACT, ""Most businesses which seek our help haven't figured out a true break-even point. What are the 'hidden' costs? How much time is being expended and how much is that time worth? Is the cost of, say, educational seminars budgeted? Accounting services for delinquent accounts? Entire car expenses?""


Takemura says most companies don't have a business plan, either. That, of course, is step one, IMPACT offers a variety of services to develop a business plan, as well as other consultation advice:


-- accounting, bookkeeping, fiscal management;


-- market research, distribution;


-- product, services evaluation;


-- advertising;


-- sales;


-- financial loan packaging and identification of funding sources;


-- bid preparation; construction negotiation;


-- licensing, bonding, insurance, certification; and


-- management consulting.


Takemura notes that if there is one common problem for new minority enterprises it would probably be undercapitalization. ""Financial institutions lend monies on the strength of equity and proven track records,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, minority entrepreneurs tend to be deficient in both areas. For the most part, their work experiences may have been in blue-collar jobs, providing little business experience in the area of management and administration.""


Banks may also be hesitant about lending to a minority firm that has already established a credit rating. Takemura says a common problem among mid-size businesses is the sudden need for much larger amounts of capital to expand. Suddenly, they're faced with demands for new equipment, up-front costs for additional materials and supplies, and personnel costs. However, they lack a sufficient line of bank credit.


IMPACT helped one mid-size business, Ogilvie and Company, recently secure a $100,000 line of credit. Alan Ogilvie says that under IMPACT's guidance his company is projecting a million dollars in sales this year. ""I think the most important advice from IMPACT was putting us on a flexible budget,"" Ogilvie said. ""We're planning expenditures based on 'x' number of sales this year. However, if we bring in more -- or less -- sales, we know exactly what we need to expend to produce.""


IMPACT not only gives guidance, but apparently the firm is a stickler for follow-through. According to Tom Bailey, owner of Maintenance Resources, Inc., they make sure you're implementing it. ""If you run into roadblocks, they'll make the personal phone calls to remove them.""


For example, Maintenance Resources had waited a year to gain entry into the competitive bidding process. ""Other business advisors had told me to contact purchasing agents, spend some time with them, and get on minority business lists,"" Bailey said. ""I did all that I thought you were supposed to Nothing happened. Then, IMPACT gave me a list of key contact people. They made telephone calls. Suddenly, a whole new set of doors opened, was not only told the right people to approach, but what style of selling would work best with each one. Who preferred to do business in person. Who preferred telephone calls. Who to write."" All seemingly little things that, in this case made a big difference.


Bailey also found out that minority businesses are at a disadvantage in the bidding process because they have little way of knowing whether industry-wide practices are legitimately acceptable or discriminatory. Under IMPACT's guidance, Bailey found that he was unfairly being told no ""They'd say the regulations say this,"" Bailey said. ""Then IMPACT would query them . . . and it would turn out that those regulations didn't even exist."" The industry had been playing by these non-existent ""rules"" for so long-that no one thought to question them.


IMPACT provides free initial consultations. Businesses grossing less than $500,000 a year are charged only $10 per hour for ensuing consultations. Firms earning more than $500,000 pay $17.50 an hour. You can reach IMPACT personnel in their North Seattle office at 525-5671.


If anything, they'll probably tell you to think bigger, not scale down. ""Minority, businesses are far more likely to set their goals too low not too high,"" Takemura says. They need to reach. Then organize so they can reach goals beyond their expectations.

NEW YORK -- Nobody agrees on exactly what it was, but everyone agrees that something bad happened Aug. 27 in the Tropic Market in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, something that led to months of protest, boycotts and racial conflict.


Two black women entered the Korean-owned fruit and vegetable store that Saturday. According to various accounts, a fight broke out after the women refused to allow the owner to search their shopping bags.


Blacks heard that the women were punched and that a knife was pulled on them. Koreans heard that the women were stealing and had attacked the owner's wife.


The scuffle, many blacks said, was the last straw in an ugly situation, what they say is the contemptous way they are treated by some Koreans who run most of the neighborhood fruit and vegetable stores, according to an article by Felicia R. Lee in The New York Times.


After a black boycott of Korean-owned stores in the area near the Tropic Market, a group of blacks and Koreans decided it was time to talk. They were worried about similiar hostilities that have flared in the city, as Korean immigrants become greengrocers in neighborhoods in which they remain minorities and outsiders.


This week the Koreans and blacks in Bedford-Stuyvesant are poised to sign an agreement they hope will set a precedent for other areas and, indeed, other cities. The pact calls for cultural exchanges and a promise that Koreans will use local banks, share their entrepreneurial skills with blacks, donate money to community organizations and trade with black businesses.


The Koreans want black help in calling off the boycott and restoring normalcy, said Sung Soo Kim, president and executive director of the 9,000-member Korean American Service Center of New York.


The agreement was negotiated by a group of blacks led by Assemblyman Albert Vann, Democrat of Brooklyn, and a group of Koreans, including business people, led by Kim. The accord was to be announced at a news conference Friday. Kim will speak for 32 Korean merchants.


In working with the merchants, the blacks have incurred the wrath of other blacks who said the negotiators were selling out and not addressing the major issue of who will control businessess in black neighborhoods. The critics want to continue the boycott.


The Koreans deny charges of racism, saying rampant theft makes them wary of all customers. Kim said that merchants were not taking over black neighborhoods, but were simply good capitalists, providing fresh produce in an area where there was none.


Blacks like Robert Sonny Carson, who has been involved several black grass-roots protests, and the Rev. Lawrence Lucas, pastor of the Resurrection Roman Catholic Church in Harlem, said such capitalism had historically left blacks on the outside as they watched successive waves of immigrants take over their neighborhood stores and become rich from black dollars that leave black communities.


""Theoretically I am very sympathetic,"" Kim said. ""But their resentment should be toward American society as a whole. We are the wrong target. To picket all Korean stores is racism.""


""It's racist that we don't own any businessess,"" Carson said, ""This is a conspiracy against the black community. We see it, we feel it, and now we're doing something about it.


""We don't need any money from the Koreans. It's inappropriate and it gets away from the broader issue. When will people stop coming into our community and disrespecting us?""


""The black community is going to become an equal partner in America or it's going to explode.""

BERKELEY -- Nobel Prizewinning chemist Yuan T. Lee, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has been named the Berkeley 1987 Alumnus of the Year. The award, presented annually to a former Berkeley student who has distinguished himself through service to society and contributions to the welfare of mankind, is the highest honor bestowed by the California Alumni Association, the 100,000-member organization of UC Berkeley graduates.


Prof. Lee will receive the award at the Alumni Association's annual charter banquet, at San Francisco's St. Francisco Hotel on Friday, March 25, at which he will give the principal address, according to a press release.


Lee, 51, earned his PhD at Berkeley in 1965, having earned his bachelor's degree from National Taiwan University in 1959 and his master's degree from Tsing-hua University in 1961. He has been a member of the Berkeley faculty since September 1974, after holding a professorship of chemistry at the University of Chicago from 1968 to 1974.


Lee was honored with the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with Harvard's Dudley Herschbach and the University of Toronto's John Polanyi) for developing the field of reaction dynamics to provide a detailed understanding of how chemical reactions take place. Since his postdoctoral work with Herschbach at Harvard, where he developed the first technique that allowed the scientists to determine how atoms and molecules interact and form products in chemical reactions, he has gone on to expand the field greatly, to provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in a broad range of chemical reactions.


Lee has called his work ""similar to the work done by particle physicists, except that instead of measuring subatomic particles, we measure chemical species. We hope to make chemistry more of an exact science.""


His current work relies on the crossed-molecular-beam technique, in which two beams of intensely packed molecules collide at right angles in a vacuum; the results show precisely how the atoms and molecules interact during that reaction. Lee himself has fabricated much of the apparatus he uses to conduct his experiments. He currently is investigating the details of chemical reactions in the combustion of hydrocarbons, research which may one day lead to more efficient combustion in energy production.


Lee had earned numerous other awards and honors before winning the Nobel Prize. Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975, the National Academy of Science in 1979 and the Academic Sinica in 1980, he is also a fellow in the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as a member of the American Chemical Society.


Among his many awards are the U.S. Department of Energy's Ernest O. Lawrence Award (1981), the Harrison Howe Award of the Rochester Section of the American Chemical Society (1983), and the American Chemical Society's Peter Debye Award of Physical Chemistry (1986). He was appointed a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow for 1976-77 and a Miller Professor at UC Berkeley in 1981. He has also received a number of honorary professorships, held numerous honorary lectureships, and been a member of the editorial boards of many of the most important technical journals in his field.


Lee is the 15th member of the Berkeley faculty to win a Nobel Prize and the seventh laureate in chemistry.


He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1974. He lives in Orinda with his wife Bernice. The couple has three children, Charlotte, Sidney and Ted.


Reservations for the black-tie optional event are required. Tickets must be requested and paid for in advance. For an invitation or more information, contact Diane Koch at Alumni House in Berkeley (94720), or call (415) 642-1574.

OAKLAND -- San Diego-based pianist Glen Horiuchi will perform with his trio and special guest, saxophonist Francis Wong, at Koncepts Cultural Gallery in Oakland on Friday, Nov. 11. Bassist M'chaka Uba and drummer Leon Alexander complete his trio.


Horiuchi, an American pianist/composer of Japanese descent, brings a startling range of influences to his music, from the fiery energy of avant-garde revolutionary Cecil Taylor to the complex rhythmic drive of traditional Japanese Taiko drums. Just as important have been the social influences, in particular the experiences gained as a community and political activist in the Asian American movement during the '80s.


In 1981 the Chicago born Sansei temporarily quit music and began working to help organize the government commission hearings investigating the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.


The deep emotive testimonies heard during the hearings inspired Horiuchi to return to music as a vehicle of personal expression. He recalls, ""Hundreds packed the hearings, courageously telling their stories, often heard for the first time, and demanded justice. The pride, unity and strength that pervaded the scene shook me. It was an experience that I'll never forget, and it directly resulted in several compositions.""


In live performance Horiuchi's music can be even more riveting. His approach shatters the stereotype of the inhibited Japanese American. The intensity of his music appeared to stun the audience at San Francisco's Asian American Jazz Festival in April.


Coda Magazine's Brian Auerbach wrote, ""The performance was a revelation in sound. Horiuchi is an active presence on piano, commanding his group through driving pieces inspired by African American creative music and tempered by the sounds and rhythms of his culture.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Young Soon Min, installation artist, sculptor and painter was here last week to lecture at the San Francisco Art Institute.


Min, is a ""1.5-generation Korean"" (a Korean American designation for an immigrant who has assimilated into another culture and in the process has lost much of the native language), who was raised in California and educated at UC Berkeley.


Min, who realized her artistic calling from childhood, began to use a minimalist approach to art when in graduate school.


""I stripped my art bare of all images, and slowly began to use an additive approach, creating a collage effect combining text with images, inspired from film and literary theories,"" said Min.


At first Min's narratives were self-referential, gradually aspiring toward more socio-political content. ""Back of the Bus"" is created from a photgraph of Min's mother riding in a U.S. army bus after the Korean war. Interspersed in the work is a cinematic snapshot effect of Min herself.


In ""Immigrant,"" a mixed media work on paper, Min explores the sociological and biological meanings of the term, a person who immigrates as well as a plant or animal which lives in a new habitat.


Much of Min's work has to do with coming to terms with a dual identity.


""It's an ongoing process where I constantly try to maintain a balance between where I come from and where I have lived most of my life,"" said Min.


Min moved to New York in 1981 to begin her career as a professional artist; since arriving, she has participated in the Arts Studio Program at the Whitney Museum, left to spend three years as a visiting instructor at the University of Ohio at Athens, and returned to New York City once again to be an artist in residence for the Asian American Arts Center.


For the last six months Min has had an installation at City Hall Park, Manhattan, entitled, ""Groundswell,"" composed of expanded metal, steel and mirror Plexiglas. The installation is sponsored by the Public Art Fund Inc. in cooperation with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation with support from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.


Today when Min is not busy with her artwork in her four-room apartment/studio in Brooklyn, she works as the administrative coordinator for the Asian American Arts Alliance, a non-profit organization with offices in Manhattan's Chinatown. The AAAA documents and promotes the work of Asian artists. Over 300 artists are currently represented in the slide archive there.

CHICAGO -- Noby Yamakoshi epitomizes the American dream. Leaving an internment camp for Chicago with $150 dollars in his pocket in 1944, he has built Nobart, Inc., a print graphics firm into an operation with $22 million in sales, serving clients such as J.C. Penney Co., Inc., and Sears, Roebuck & Co., according to an article in the Chicago Tribune.


When Yamakoshi was 17, he followed a friend to Chicago to study commercial art at the Academy of Fine Arts.


Following his graduation, Yamakoshi scored a job with an advertising agency at $22 a week. Thinking he could do better on his own, he began a business a year and a half later with his wife working as a receptionist-illustrator.


Yamakoshi, a native of California says he considers the United States as ""the greatest country in the world. There's more opportunity here.""


He has no bitterness for the two years he spent in World War II in a Japanese American internment camp in the Arizona desert.


Yamakoshi believes that it was one of those experiences that could either make or break a person.


""It was a shock,"" he said of the evacuation of his family and thousands of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. ""I thought I was a loyal American citizen like anybody else.""


Yamakoshi's family, who lived on a farm, was given one week to get rid of their belongings. A new tractor had to be sold for $50. Family members took what they could carry to the camp.


He remembers temperatures of up to 135 degrees, sentries armed with machine guns, sandstorms, scorpions and rattlesnakes. Usually after a storm, two inches of sand would be found in the tar paper barracks. Food was so scarce in the first year, that ""we had to eat grass"" until vegetables could be grown the next summer,"" said Yamakoshi.


""There's nothing you can do about it,"" he said. ""It's something that happens ... You come out and try to make the best of it."" He said he favors a national monument instead of reparation payments for internment survivors.


Life in the camp strengthened Yamakoshi, gave him a desire to succeed in America and get exposed to a wide range of professions he would not have gotten on a farm, he said.


""It gave us a greater opportunity to allow us to seek different avenues,"" said Yamakoshi.


In 1944, Yamakoshi, who graduated from the camp high school, attained a ticket from the War Relocation Authority, and left for Chicago.


Launching a business was not easy, and Yamakoshi felt the current climate unhospitable for a Japanese American after World War II.


He remembered that Japanese Americans who attended a Buddhist church on Sundays on the South Side would never leave the building more than two at a time.


""We didn't want to create a scene,"" he said.


He decided that a Japanese sounding name for his company would be unwise, so he combined part of his first name with ""art.""


Things were difficult in the beginning. Yamakoshi's first client went bankrupt after he put in $1,200 worth of work and two months of times.


""When you have nothing, you have nothing to lose,"" he said.


He decided that a Japanese sounding name for his company would be unwise, so he combined part of his first name with ""art.""


Things were difficult in the beginning. Yamakoshi's first client went bankrupt after he put in $1,200 worth of work and two months of time.


""When you have nothing, you have nothing to lose,"" he said.


After many years of hard work, his company now specializes in producing promotional materials for housewares, sporting goods, electronics, fashion and home furnishings. Catalogues are essential to Nobart's existence. Its 145 clients range from catalogue showrooms to mass merchandisers, and from direct-mail businesses to department stores.


Nobart offers layout, design, copywriting, color separation, typesetting, photography at a single building on Wabash Avenue.


The company has four buildings in Chicago, a New York studio with a staff of 75 and a joint company in Japan.


At the Chicago headquarters, carpenters build a set to display Sears' garden tools and a photographer shoots a miniature Cadillac for a Miami department store.


Computers have become a vital facet of the business. One computer actually creates photos. Sometimes, it is cheaper to ""build"" a white and pink stucco wall for an advertisement on the computer than have workmen construct a 20-foot model. In spite of this, Nobart employs a crew of 25 to build sets.


The graphics business is a creative as well as a competitive one. Prices have dropped because of freelance photographers, agencies and major studios.


According to a Nobart competitor, Grignon Studios Inc., small product work, and furniture, prices are lower than a decade ago.


""It's a troubled industry,"" said president Bruce Benton. ""It needs a shakeout.


""It's gotten very competitive,"" said Warren Yamakoshi, Noby's son and Nobart's vice president of marketing. He recalls once a rival's bid on one project came in at less than half of Nobart's offer.


""We're just not going to fight that war,"" said the younger Yamakoshi. ""It just ends up hurting the bottom line.""


In order to gain an edge in the competition, Nobart's strategy is to try and get close to its customers.


""There are so many people in that business who will promise you anything to get the job, but delivery was a different story,"" said Bob Clemens, director of sales planning and research for Wilson Sporting Goods Co. which hired Nobart to produce a clothing catalogue. The elder Yamakoshi ""was never that way,"" he added.


""It's so simple and basic, yet so many people forget about it and they wonder why they're not successful. He's dependable,"" said Clemens, who has known Yamakoshi for 25 years.


""Nobody does it by himself,"" said Yamakoshi. ""That's very important in business. If you don't recognize that, if you think you did everything yourself, you can't make it.


""And things are always changing,"" said Yamakoshi, who admits his business philosophy is influenced by Buddhist thought. ""Those are the key things in business and life.""


To help ensure the success of his business, Yamakoshi has slowed down from his early years in the business. He's still at the office 12 hours each day and half a day Saturday, in addition to reading reports and papers late at night.


After figuring out that 168 hours add up to a week, he mourns the fact that he spends only half of his life working.


""It's too bad we all have to sleep,"" Yamakoshi said. ""It's a waste of time.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Marina Feleo Gonzalez, recognized as doyenne of Filipino American writers in New York, flew into town last summer to meet with local literati and begin research for a future work. Feleo Gonzalez returns on Jan. 23 to launch production on the now-completed play, ""A Song For Manong,"" her tribute to Filipino pioneers.


Feleo Gonzalez is noted for her screenplay, ""Minsa'y Isang Gamu-Gamo (Once a Moth),"" which has won awards and critical acclamation in film festivals in Asia, Europe and the U.S. Her latest opus is Part 3 of ""Bamboo That Snaps Back,"" the multimedia performance art series on Asian American immigrant experiences conceived by Chinese American jazz artist and cultural activist Fred Houn.


Houn, a native of Palo Alto now transplanted to New York, commissioned Feleo Gonzalez to write the script for the Filipino continuum of his series. It was that assignment which brought her to San Francisco in April last year, a visit that was met with excitement by artists, writers and movers of the small but solid Filipino culture circuit.


One of the many receptions for Feleo Gonzalez was attended by Luz De Leon, formerly of the San Francisco Mural Resources Center and current national executive director of Likha, the cultural network which produced the 1987 tour of the Philippine Experimental Theatre Association, or PETA. The PETA roadshow has been heralded as the most successful production staged through the continent by a Filipino group.


""We were captivated by Marina,"" De Leon gushed over the writer. ""She sat there and spoke with this great facility for both English and Tagalog. She could have told stories all day and we would have listened. Instantly her audience became the Marina Feleo Gonzalez Fan Club.""


De Leon and the Likha Bay Area Chapter joined Feleo Gonzalez's visits to senior centers. De Leon offered as side tour a drive to the Philippine-inspired murals which she had helped fund.


""We did not know it then, but Marina was sure: she was convinced that we could meet again on a professional level,"" De Leon recalled.


In the fall of 1987 De Leon received the first draft of ""A Song For Manong."" ""It was the vehicle we needed to incite new pride in our native culture. And Marina would be the symbol.""


De Leon pointed out a dearth in the community of Filipino cultural activities already dominated by pop concerts and beauty contests. ""We have more than tinkling and lumpia or copies of western songs and performances,"" De Leon asserted.


By deciding to produce Feleo Gonzalez's play, Likha has exceeded its goal. ""A Song For Manong"" not only pays homage to the perseverance of the first Filipino immigrants, it also brings about a convergence of artists from this diverse society.


Ethnic Filipino dance artist Alleluia Panis will choreograph and play the female lead while actor Ron Muriera assays the male lead. Santiago Bose will fly from Manila to conceive the visual design and Chinese American pianist Jon Jang joins Houn's Asian American Art Ensemble of New York in providing the musical score. Amy Meueller will direct the play, with the technical supervision of Feleo Gonzalez.


What will unfold at the Likha gala (at the Herbst Theatre on Feb. 22 followed by a San Francisco run produced by Life on the Water at Fort Mason on Feb. 24-27) is a collaboration which De Leon hopes will spark more collaborations.


A more immediate result, she trusted, is to generate ""a cultural promotions fund so we can develop more projects and encourage more artists. It's a good start. As people are advocating for the community interest in terms of better teachers and guidance counselors, services for seniors and the youth, they will see that cultural activities are fundamental to community building. We have a responsibility to all immigrants.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Gang threats turned to gunfire in the Richmond and Ingleside districts early Saturday morning as rival youth gang members sprayed bullets into the homes of two Washington High School youths.


Police are attempting to link a 20-year-old San Francisco man the U.S. Park Police arrested at Land's End Sunday with the attacks on members of the Local Motion gang and their families.


Members of the Asian Invasion youth gang are suspected by police in the attacks.


The incidents were the second and third such attacks since a similar Ingleside District shooting spree against a member of the same Washington High gang Dec. 1.


In all three attacks, 8mm bullets, which police say are probably from an Uzi semi-automatic rifle or automatic machine gun, were fired into the homes.


In the Richmond attack, as many as 159mm rounds punched holes in the garage, front window and white stucco front of a home on the 600 block of 40th Avenue.


""Locals Die"" and ""Die Jap"" were spray painted on the house, along with other graffiti.


The bullets were fired during two separate attacks on the same house early that morning.


Less than three hours later, the home of another Local Motion member on Beverly Street in the Ingleside was hit by 9mm gunfire.


There were no injuries reported after either attack.


Park Police Officer Lisa Dunlop arrested Albert Ng, 20, near the China Beach area at 12:58 Sunday morning after discovering a loaded Uzi on the floor of the car he was riding in.


Dunlop stopped the car when its driver attempted to back away without turning on its headlights when the police car approached, Sgt. Frank Abbetantuono said.


The Uzi, with a 9mm clip and a bullet in the chamber, was in a black and silver nylon bag on the passenger side of the vehicle.


Four juveniles were also in the car.


Members of the Gang Task Force will not comment on the investigation or on whether Ng has links to area gangs.


Police are increasingly fearful that the two high school youth gangs could start a full-fledged turf war.


The gangs in the Richmond District are starting to fight with eachother but have not attempted to stake a claim on public or private property, he said.


""Most of the gangs that you hear about aren't actually full-fledged, organized gangs,"" Foley said.


""Our job is to stop them from ever getting to that point.""


Foley and Richmond Station officers agree that neither group seems to have graduated into serious organized crimes.


An important thing to stress to the community at such forums is that not every group of Asian youth standing in a park or on a streetcorner is a youth gang, the officer said.


Bok Pon, president of the Richmond District American Chinese Association, asked the police at last week's meeting to identify the youth gangs and clarify their levels of activities.

SAN FRANCISCO -- For 14 years, Franco Consolacion has been chomping at the bit. Consolacion, founder of the Filipino Accountants Association, the group which fought for and won in 1984 the licensing of foreigntrained accountants, is mustering his forces for yet another fight: to put a Filipino American on the Board of Accountancy.


""The crises are far from over. As licensees we have inherent problems. Our conduct and behavior as CPAs are being monitored by the board, which promulgates rules and regulations governing our profession. Hence we need someone there to act as our eyes and ears. But notwithstanding the fact that we now have the greatest number of CPAs compared to the blacks and Latinos, there is no Filipino member on the board. Why? Because we have no political clout,"" Consolacion said in his address at the FAA's 14th anniversary celebration recently at the Amfac hotel in Burlingame.


Political power, Consolacion later told Asian Week, is accessible to those willing to contribute to the administration. ""The appointments are very selective, and those who give much financial support get the share of the pie,"" he concluded.


Henry Yee, a Chinese American, is the only minority on the current 12-member board. But the first Asian appointments were Filipino Americans Tim Dayonot and Mel Santos as public members.


""Their tenure was very productive because they helped monitor implementation of the mandate for the board to modify its policies in relation to the Philippine judgement,"" Concolacion said, referring to the changes his organization had worked for.


In January two vacancies will be created with the expiration of the terms of two of the eight CPAs on the board. Consolacion wants a Filipino American to be appointed to one of those seats.


""The FAA has recommended a qualified candidate to the governor,"" he said but declined to identify the candidate. ""We're doing the work by ourselves. We're getting no help from the community base.""


In his current effort Consolacion is relying once more on the assistance of public interest lawyer Robert Gnaizda, a key player in the landmark licensing effort.


The Filipino Accountants Association was founded in August 1974, a year after Consolacion authored a resolution co-signed by Rolando Romero, Manuel Gratuito and Benjamin Domingo asking the board of accountancy to recognize accountants trained in the Philippines.


The organization's initial efforts led to the introduction by state Sen. John Foran of a bill providing for ""equal treament"" of Filipino CPAs. The bill was originally drafted by Consolacion, lawyer Raul Daza and Arie Schorl, aide to Sen. David Roberti.


In 1976 Gnaizda offered his assistance to the Filipinos. Two years later he filed an administrative complaint charging the board of accountancy with discrimination and gross civil rights violations before a joint committee headed by Richar Spohn, director of consumer affairs. In January 1978 the Spohn committee found the board guilty as charged. By September of the same year Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 1495 which illegalizes the establishment by licensing boards of qualifications which have discriminatory effects on specified sectors.


Believing that the board had failed to comply with the instructions of the Spohn committee, Consolacion filed a class action suit against the panel. Judge Eugene Gualco of the Sacramento Superior Court found the board guilty of discrimination.


In August 1981 Consolacion was appointed to the Independent Inquiry Committe tasked to probe practices that discourage Filipinos from applying for licenses. The committee's recommendations eventually paved the way for amendment of the board's guidelines on the processing of applications and determining of equivalency of experience.


Some 600 Filipinos took advantage of the waiver of examinations by applying for their licenses. More than half of those applications were successful. There are now 303 Filipino American accountants practicing in California.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Crisy Field fireworks have burned out, but for the Filipino American Democratic Club-San Francisco, the political pyrotechnics are just about to begin.


Last June 29 the FADC-SF elected its new set of officers led by realtor Wendell Michelob, who drew 79 votes against social worker Emil de Guzman's 44 to become the new president.


Michelob, 39, is known as an astute businessman and a staunch community action supporter. He surprised few by deciding to run for office two weeks prior to election day, and winning. He takes the helm long dominated by lawyers and has promised to restore the organization's political authority and prestige, his style.


Michelob believes that the 10 years he has been in real estate have imbued him with the qualities necessary to propel the organization in the right direction.


""My background as a businessman gives me a better insight on the viability of projects,"" he told Asian Week. ""I can foresee if goals are feasible or not, what the possible obstacles are and how to overcome them.""


The club had been quiet for the past nine months, and Michelob is all set for action.


""I want the club to have more visibility in city, state and national politics. That means increasing our membership and participation. 1988 is a crucial, year with all elections taking place.


""We have to get active by grassroots organizing, get people to register to vote, set up fund-raisers like fiestas with other Filipino organizations and minority clubs.""


To get on the right track, Michelob is mulling a ""lively and vibrant induction night within the next 60 days with Mayor Art Agnos officiating. We will invite all community organizations to come on a table-by-table basis. At this point the Filipinos should realize that financial contributions are necessary to boost candidates and propositions that affect them whether directly or indirectly. The FADC is the channel through which they can voice those choices."" He feels very strongly about the voters registration project which he personally undertook in his Excelsior-Crocker/Amazon district during the Agnos campaign.


""I've found out that people object to getting registered for so many reasons. They say it increases their chances for jury duty, which makes them skip work and can be financially disadvantageous. Some say they don't have the time. Others think their vote just won't make a difference, but the bottom line is that it does make the difference.""


In Michelob's profession workers are trained to live and not just remember theory. ""You have to examine your goals and give yourself a deadline,"" is a Michelob credo derived from his years as broker and co-owner of the Daly City-based Century 21-Herd and Company. ""By doing that, you'll know how well you're doing. What's best is what works.""


The FADC-SF's first board meeting is not due till the middle of this month, and already Michelob is preparing programs for his entire term.


""I'd like to initiate and develop projects that support the political consciousness of our young people,"" he cited a subject close to his heart. ""The youth should be encouraged to partake in the political process regularly. We could start engaging them on a weekend basis to attend association meetings and register voters. They could also work on campaigns. We should tap organizations that involve the youth like church and school groups, and impress on them the need to get the young people involved.""


Michelob also eyed more participation from the elderly.


""I don't think the seniors are as involved as they should be. We should create an atmosphere so that they will be motivated to participate. We should let them feel important by acknowledging their performance. This can be done with visual aids like a graph to chart their contributions to the voters' registration.""


The issue of Filipino unity is another target of the Michelob administration, and his views are both optimistic and realistic. He said, ""Filipino citizens in San Francisco have demonstrated their unity by registering, during the Agnos campaign, whether they are Republican or Democrat.


""Unity is achievable on a case to case basis. For example when Rod McLeod applied for education commissioner, there was no dissent over his qualifications. The same happened in Rodel Rodis' appointment to the Public Utilities commission; there was overwhelming support from the community.""


Addressing the so-called division of community leaders, Michelob said, ""Issues will come up calling for input from all, and contending forces will be forced to play and work on these issues affecting our people. There will always be opposing views on how goals should be achieved, but the question is who's going to bring up the most viable solution?""


Michclob came to the U.S. fresh from graduation in the Philippines with a political science degree. He had harbored ambitions of studying law but instead found employment as mail room clerk at Standard Oil of California.


In 1972 Michelob moved to California Blue Shield as supply clerk, eventually getting promoted to customer service representative. While there he signed up with the union, was voted shop steward and member of the negotiating committee.


Came 1978 and the surge of Filipinos looking for investments, which in turn opened new prospects for the business-inclined. At this juncture Michelob chose to stake his future in real estate, believeing that his ""win-win situation for all parties concerned"" would benefit himself and his future clients.


In his first year as realtor Michelob sold $1 million worth of properties, and the figure rose each year. In 1984 he surpassed his own goals by making a single sale worth $33 million.


Despite his financial success Michelob retained ties with the different sectors of the community. He was president of the Pilipino American Legal Defense Fund and and the Pilipino Amrican Cultural Foundation. He is founding member of the District 8 Democratic Club and is a board member of the Likha Cultural Network.


In 1977 Michelob was among the hundreds of Filipino students who formed a human barricade trying to prevent the demolition of the International Hotel. ""I was always out there, but maybe not as visible as I am now,"" he said in response to an observation made by an FADC member who was concerned that Michelob may not be an committed as his contemporaries.


""I'm not a late bloomer; I've always been where the action is. But after achieving a certain amount of success in your particular profession, you go back to your community. I get a kick out of doing it and it's not because I owe them anything or vice versa but because I want to make a contribution I feel capable of making.""


Some FADC members doubt if Michelob indeed has the organization's mandate since ""he won by bringing in so many voters.""

A critical problem among Asian faculty is the low numbers who have tenure. Tenure represents job security for teachers and usually means that they cannot be fired except under, special circumstances.


Many universities see themselves as being above the law when it comes to personnel practices, claiming academic freedom and other reasons, said attorney Dale Minami.


""Do everything you can before you sue a university,"" he said. ""Hiring an attorney is so expensive it will blow your mind.""


To Minami, who has handled a number of grievance cases, the university is, like any other employer, responsible to fair employment laws.


Instead of depending on the legal process, said Minami, make a point of reviewing the university's or college's grievance procedures. Because many colleges and universities are unfamiliar with their own grievance procedures, ""it makes you a test case,"" he said.


In addition he advised that people review the personnel manual.


Concerning being promoted to tenure, Minami said that a professor's research is what is usually attacked. ""If they don't like you that's where they'll get you.""


Either the research is not innovative, creative or analytical. ""These words are hard to impeach,"" he added. ""A judge and a jury find them hard to judge.""


Minami concluded by advising the audience to hire a lawyer only as a last resort, not to depend on the legal process to win their battles and to remember that promotions are not based simply on merit.


Panelist and Professor Sucheng Chan said, ""I see new forms of racism that have developed in the last five years.""


While serving on several committees that searched for potential faculty candidates, Chan said she noticed an interesting phenomenon. ""There is a clear preference for people who are unlikely to rock the boat,"" she said. Those minorities usually considered ""are not people who are likely to attack the administration,"" said the lively Asian American studies professor.


Chan noted that many Asians shy away from politics because culturally they are raised to be polite and not question authority.


But she added encouragingly that being an advocate and politically aware can work at certain levels. People need to understand, emphasized Chan, that universities and colleges are ""dispersed systems of power and authority,"" and that ""a lot of power in the UC system resided in the departments with the faculty.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Next year when Congress convenes, Japanese American civil rights groups will closely monitor a proposed appropriations bill that will establish redress disbursement measures for former internees of World War II camps.


Last August the bill authorizing individual $20,000 reparations payments was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan after years of lobbying efforts by Japanese American individuals and civil rights groups.


Groups like the National Coalition of Redress and Reparations and the Japanese American Citizens League are hoping that 1989 will mark the year that the appropriations bill is penned into law.


But before money can be distributed to some 60,000 former internees, the appropriation bill must first be created and approved by a special congressional committee, explained John Ota, spokesperson for the NCRR. He said then the bill will go to the floor for a vote and finally must be signed by the president before it can become law.


Ota said civil rights groups like the NCRR aren't that concerned with the bill passing through Congress but rather are concerned about just how much will be included in it.


Ota said Japanese American groups and individuals want to ensure that internees get paid as soon as possible. But he noted that it could take from three to 10 years under the soon-to-be-drafted bill.


""We will be pushing for a three-year period, so in order to do that the maximum of $500,000 a year will have to be granted,"" said Ota.


He said lower denominations of appropriations would mean funds would be spread out over a longer period.


Ota indicated that groups began sending Congress letters in support of acting swiftly and in favor of appropriations that will allow for the earliest dispersal of funds immediately after the bill was signed in August. According to Ota, 1,000 letters have been sent.


Ota expects that the payments could begin as early as October of 1989.

PACIFICA, CA. -- The first Filipino American to win an elective seat in this coastal city three years ago is aiming for yet another. Laguna Salada School Board Member John Schneider is only 26 and does not own a college diploma, but he thinks he is just as qualified as the other four candidates vying for the two seats on the city council.


""I've lived in Pacifica all my life, I grew up here. I've seen how this city was 20 years ago and I know what it needs today,"" Schneider told Asian Week.


Calling himself ""a student of life,"" Schneider pursued his first major goals within the last five years. In 1983 he was appointed manager of the Eureka Square Shopping Center although nothing in his resume indicated any experience tailoring him for the job. In '85 he was elected to the School Board, the youngest ever.


He may not be a degree holder, but Schneider takes his homework seriously.


""Like I've done all my life, I did research, connected with the right people and used my common sense,"" he said.


Pacifica, a bedroom community southwest of San Francisco, has a population of 39,000 with a high concentration young residents. Some 6,000 Pacificans are adults under the age of 40, 8,000 or women, and 10,000 are children.


About 50 percent of the northern district, which borders Daly City, is comprised of minorities, according to Schneider. Minorities make up 10 percent of the southern area, he added. (The Pacifica Chamber of Commerce said it did not have the figures on the city's minority population).


Schneider is offering Pacifica ""my experience in making tough decisions, my business expertise and my intimate knowledge of the school district. I am a consumer of the service, I'm a product of this school system.""


Schneider is confident that he will win over those who censured him in 1986 after the teachers walked out to demand wage increases.


""I ended the strike by breaking with the board of trustees and siding with the teachers. I was accused of divulging information. What I did was, I felt that it was morally wrong to have the money and yet have the teachers, who are vital to our community, out in the streets. The teachers (eventually) got the salary they wanted, and we're still here, we're thriving.""


Though born in Pacifica, Schneider spent many summers in his mother's hometown, Baguio in the Philippines, and in other Asian cities. As a child he was introduced to the business world by his father, a real estate agent. Though claiming to have a ""strong feeling of (Asian) culture,"" Schneider was not involved in the Filipino community until 1986 when he was invited by family friend Alex Esclamado, one of his role models, to the Filipino American Unity Conference in Anaheim.


On his own, however, Schneider had been active in campus politics as student body president at Terra Nova High School. He spent a brief term at the Berklee College of Music in Boston but decided that graduation could wait, marriage could not. After he wed his wife Patty, Schneider joined the family business, Marc Realty, where he is vice president.


""Asian Americans in general have to be more active. They should get involved, broaden up. They're a little afraid to get involved. I've noticed that there's a lot of apathy for politics, and we must do more to change it,"" he said.


Schneider's looks and name conceal his Asian identity and he has never encountered anti-Asian sentiment, he said. But his wife has. ""Patty, who's Korean, used to live in San Francisco. She never experienced prejudice there, but she did in Pacifica where her classmates pulled her hair and called her Japanese."" The hostility, he conceded, is reflective of ""prejudice rampant in neighboral communities that still exists today.""


If he looked less Caucasian and sported a more foreign-sounding name, Schneider said he probably would have had to wage a tougher campaign. But race is not the issue here, he contended. Service is.


""I'm interjecting a different kind of politics. I care about serving my community, and that's projected in my campaign. I'm backed by the firefighters, the school board, the homeowners, the Sierra Club, the PG&E employees. I think I've got a good cross section of supporters.""


The tourism industry, next to taxes Pacifica's other income earner, is on the rise, he said, ""if you consider that before there was nothing."" That's another area he promises to upgrade.


His one great achievement, he said, is having linked the business and education communities, business with the environmentalists.


""You'll notice that this city has a tremendous environmental bent unhindered by large scale development, and it's natural that we would want to protect it. But there's a misconception that if you're involved with business, you're anti-environment.""


It's a view that is not his alone, he said.


""It took my community a lot of courage to elect me to the school board, and it will take that same courage to elect me to the city council.""


Schneider also vows increased child care for low to mid-income families, safety ordinances for seniors, a youth center to be run by a dedicated teen commission, and growth control.

NEW YORK -- If it were ever possible to have a small political contest in New York City, one would think that the selection of a committee position within the local Democratic Party would be one.


But in this national election year, not even Margaret Chin's race for re-election to Democratic committeewoman for the 61st Assembly District has escaped the peculiar frenzy of national politics.


Two years ago the diminutive neighborhood activist ran for the position of Party committeewoman and won. Her district encompasses most of lower Manhattan and almost all the key liberal neighborhoods that comprise Greenwich Village. It is a fertile, progressive political environment, one that has been the birthplace of many remarkable political careers.


""It's a very diverse district,"" she says, ""but there are a lot of common issues."" If she seems somewhat bemused by her current place in the limelight, she is adamant about defending her position in a race that has been marked by the all too familiar extremes of negative campaigning. Even in this seemingly most liberal of all political communities, Chin's opponents have been accused by New York media and politicians of resorting to tactics described as ""McCarthyite smears"" and ""witch hunts.""


The primary source of Chin's opposition is a political organization developed in support of and under the tutelage of New York City Mayor Ed Koch. The irony, for Margaret Chin, is that her strongest support comes from the very organizations that served to launch the mayor's political career.


""The mayor wants to gain back his base, which was the Village. He was a progressive politician that came out of the Village fighting against the machine. Now he becomes the machine. A lot of the attack on me is because I am supported by this group.""


The spotlight has been very harsh on the New York mayor, especially since his very public attacks on the candidacy of Rev. Jesse Jackson in New York's presidential primary of this past summer.


""His image is not good out there,"" she says. ""A lot of people are very upset with him. That's why this race, for him, is crucial for next year. He will want to have his home base' behind him. He is putting a lot of his resources in there.""


Chin remains determined to stay on. In New York, where winning a Democratic primary is tantamount to victory in the general election, she sees this position as key in developing municipal and state policies for the good of the formerly disenfranchised in the community.


""We have a lot of input in terms of Democratic Party positions and platforms and also with elected officials who are Democrats. We do advocacy,"" she says. ""It is influencing the Democratic Party for them to really understand what kind of issues are of concern to people in the community.""


Although only sections of New York's Chinatown fall into the 61st Assembly District, Chin's long history as a resident of the Chinatown community marks her with a constant awareness of the uniqueness of her current position.


""It's important in terms of getting more Asian Americans involved in politics. It's a voice to get the issues of Asian Americans out there. On the State Committee we have 300 members. I'm the only Asian American elected representative out of 300.""


Victory for Margaret Chin is by no means certain. In the last days of this campaign she remains optimistic and, as always, active.


""We're still doing what we have to do that one-to-one contact and just reaching out to as many people as we can.""

LOS ANGELES -- A report on Los Angeles' future problems and solutions called ""Los Angeles 2000"" was presented to about 30 Asian business leaders at a luncheon in the downtown Bank of America building Tuesday.


""This is the first time the Asian American community was asked to provide feedback and input to a study of this magnitude,"" said Lilly Lee, one of 85 directors whom Mayor Tom Bradley had asked to serve on the L.A. 2000 committee three years ago.


""We estimated-that by the year 1995, one-sixth, instead of the current one-tenth, of all jobs in the metropolitan area will be supported by foreign trade,"" Lee said, ""and Asian trade alone is 50 percent higher than trade with Europe and it is still growing. For that reason it makes sense to consult the Asian business community in our planning.""


Moreover, next to the Hispanics, Asians are the fastest growing group in Southern California, estimated to constitute about 10 percent of the 18 million population by the year 2010. Lee said. Hispanics are projected to be one of the largest groups along with whites, both at 40 percent, while blacks are estimated to remain at 10 percent.


And with the increased and diverse population, problems such as traffic congestion, quality education and housing shortage, etc, will need to be addressed, said Jane Pisano, president of the L.A. 2000 committee. ""The report is not about crystal ball gazing or prediction, but if we look very closely, we can see the future today.""


A net gain of three million jobs, according to the report, is expected by the year 2010 in the greater Los Angeles area. But most of the jobs will be in Los Angeles and north Orange Counties while most additional housing units will be built in the outlying areas of the five-county region. As a result more people will commute to work longer, and the number of vehicle hours traveled could increase by 300 percent. Also, the amount of time commuters will spend in traffic congestion is projected to increase five-fold.


In its report the committee recommended lessening traffic congestion by:


* construction new roads, freeways and rail projects;


* using jobs/housing balance as a planning guideline at the community, city and regional levels;


* and requiring employers to take more direct responsibility for the commute of their employees.


In the area of education, ""we as a community have failed our schools,"" said Pisano. Los Angeles has the highest student-teacher ratios and the highest drop-out rate in the nation, and California ranks 49th in per capita school funding. ""We will not be able to solve problems and achieve our goals with our schools in their current condition.""


Among many other recommendations the committee suggests that the mayor and the L.A. school district form a Class of the Year 2000 Commission to:


(a) develop appropriate and specific educational goals for each class level;


(b) review educational strategies pursued both within the schools and through educational partnerships;


(c) develop the necessary tools to track and assess educational progress; and


(d) disseminate findings; at an estimated cost of $300,000 annually for 12 years.


The 96-page report details projected problems and recommendations in five major categories including Livable Communities, Environmental Quality, Individual Fulfillment, Enriching Diversity and A Crossroads City. It is the result of three years of weekly committee work of about 150 people.


Pisano said the report has been submitted to the mayor but is far from implementation. ""The hard part would be establishing anorganization to make it happen,"" she said.


Nevertheless, it's important that Asian Americans participate in shaping the future of our city, beginning at the discussion level, said Lee. ""Instead of letting others making decisions on our behalf we need to become part of the system and say 'I need to do things this way,' or 'I want the system changed that way to make making money easier.' We must show that we are not just here to make money, but care enough to improve our city,"" Lee said.


Single coples of the report can be obtained by writing Mayor Tom Bradley, City Hall, 200 N Spring St., L.A. 90012.

Being rejected as a suitable patron of the nightclub Vertigo in downtown Los Angeles could have been downright traumatic. There are a few trendy spots such as the Stock Exchange and the Vertigo where the hopeful stand roped off from the entrance silently pleading to the keepers of the rope that they be allowed admittance.


The crowd standing outside the entrance to the Vertigo was morbidly silent. They were dressed to the nines, some with spiked hair, most of the women in mini-skirts and most of the men in jackets. They young attractive people were from all ethnic groups; and from what I could tell, ethnicity was not the criteria for getting the ""O.K. You're good enough for us; come on in"" sign.


It seemed certain small groups were admitted as soon as they approached even before they had to inch their way up to the rope through the waiting crowd. There were three tall mini-skirted women who no sooner walked up and the rope keeper unhooked the rope and beckoned them in as though they were royalty.


Some of you might ask what I was doing at such a snobby place anyway waiting to be anointed by a rope keeper. It's a rather convoluted story, so please bear with me. You see, I had attended the Los Angeles County Democratic Convention to find out what kind of primary furor was being built around Dukakis and Jackson and other candidates. I heard L.A. council member Richard Alatorre give a rather low-keyed pitch for Dukakis then Rep. Ron Dellums did a rousing bid for Jackson. The platform stuff was passed with little debate.


While at the convention I also wanted to check out the amount of participation of Pacific Asian Americans in the party. Kaz Umemoto was the only Asian on the dais. He was at the podium talking about the homeless portion of the platform, but he left the dais afterward There were approximately 15 people seated up there at a long table on risers. Five were black, I couldn't discern a Hispanic, and the rest were white; a few of them were women. I did, however, meet two Vietnamese teachers, Than Hao Huynh from Alhambra, and Minh Mullen from Pasadena, who were attending their first convention.


I didn't get a chance to talk with Jim B. Clarke, L.A. County Democratic Party chair, about my dismay at the lack of visible Asian Pacific Americans at the function. I was able to get in a few words with Rep. Dellums and mentioned to him that when I was in Lithuania in 1981, I saw a local newspaper written in English touting him as a good prospect for the president of the United States.


The rest of the convention was spent hobnobbing with candidates and their supporters and discussing possible television or print coverage. The Franklin Delano Roosevelt dinner went as most political dinners go. There was a long rambling speech by Assemblymember Dick Floyd, all the incumbents and candidates were introduced and a number of party workers were acknowledged with awards. Looking at the list of awardees, according to the names, it doesn't appear there were any Pacific Asians. I was too far back in the room to really see what ethnicity they were. I was rather surprised that the entertainment by the Moving Dance. Images of Cal State L.A. featured a couple numbers which would be considered sexist by some feminists. We were kidding at my table that at least there would have been equality if the group had some scantily dressed males.


After the event was over I happened to be walking out with a candidate and one of his campaign workers. That's when it was decided we should try to get in the Vertigo club. We removed our campaign buttons and speculated whether we looked too darky to get in. Even though I'm not in my 20s, I was wearing a miniskirt (although not made of leather) and a trendy looking top. The candidate had on the requisite dark blue suit and red tie but the campaign worker was questionable because of his glasses and haircut. We decided to attempt it anyway.


As we stood outside Vertigo with the hopeful denizens of the trendy night world, I was unable to figure out what sort of attitude I should adopt to increase our chances of admittance. The campaign worker thought if he put his dark glasses (clip-on style) over his regular glasses, that might help. It didn't. And we didn't pass muster; the keepers of the rope didn't like us. As we were leaving, two guys getting into their imported compact car said their friend at the door could get us in as they got back from Alhambra where they were going to get jackets so as soon to be dressed properly. We said, ""Never mind.""


The three of us rejects ended up in the revolving bar at the to of the Bonaventure Hotel. We had a good laugh at our attempt to be trendy and nursed only slightly bruised egos.

MONTEREY PARK -- Most first-generation Chinese immigrants in Monterey Park favored George Bush, according to a survey conducted on Nov. 8 by a reporter for the China Times Weekly, a Los Angeles-based Chinese language weekly newspaper.


Of Monterey Park's American-born Chinese, however, more voted for Governor Dukakis.


""I voted for George Bush because I'm a conservative and was happy with the past eight years of the Republican administration,"" said Yang Yee Chun, summing up what seemed to be a general sentiment among his peers. The Times estimates that 70 percent of the mostly middle-aged Chinese immigrants, like Chun, voted for Bush for three major reasons: they are satisfied economically after eight years of the Reagan administration, they are against protectionism due to strong ties with Taiwan, and they are emotionally and sentimentally pro-Republican.


A Mr. Leu, another of the voters interviewed, is in the import-export business and mainly favored Bush because of his stand on international trade. ""I voted for Bush because the Republican Party is for free trade. If Dukakis wins, we will become a more protectionist state which would not be good for my business.""


Sixteen of 23 middle-aged Chinese immigrants approached by the reporter voted for Bush overall; of 16 immigrant Chinese women polled, 15 voted for Bush. Though more Chinese women seemed to have voted for Bush than Chinese men, most of the women polled were from Taiwan, a strong influencing factor considering Bush's strong stand against protectionism. The Chinese women polled also said they get a secure feeling from Bush and believe he is tough on drugs and crime.


The younger, mostly Democratic American-born Chinese of Monterey Park, on the other hand, supported Dukakis because they perceived him as strong on civil rights and, if elected, a president who would take care of minorities.


The contrast indicates the special ethnic characteristics of Monterey's Chinese voters. First-generation immigrants seem less concerned with civil rights and benefits than with their own interests and the relationship between other countries and the U.S. Second-generation Chinese American consider issues involved in civil rights very important when they go to the polls.


Statistics also showed that the percentages of citizens who voted among all of Monterey Park's ethnic groups was about equal.

Since the Year of the Dragon is traditionally considered lucky for weddings and babies, Mr. Lee Tung has certainly picked a fitting one in which to open his Call Me Dragon Entertainment and Catering Hall Company in the East San Jose area. His goal is to be the first full service wedding consultant company for Asians, offering the hall, catering, the photographer, floral arrangements, entertainment, bridal attire and limousine service. In addition, last month Tung opened an office at Lion Plaza which offers a full service real estate land development company under the auspices of the EIC Group Inc. As if that weren't enough, he also opened three new restaurants in the International Food Court of the Plaza.


Follows Father's Footsteps


Born in Tapei, Lee Tung is following in the footsteps of his father who was a developer of commercial real estate. He worked in the textile industry there, managing a factory which produced men's wear. Lee was married with one of his two children when, at 23, he decided to move to the United States, the ""land of opportunity."" He explains, ""I am always looking to challenge myself.""


Great American Dream


He arrived in Santa Clara, California in 1982 and opened up the United Import/Export Company, selling wholesale giftwares imported from Taiwan. One weekend in Santa Clara County he tried selling his wares at the Berryessa Flea Market, the largest Flea Market in California. To his surprise he was very successful and soon spending his weekends getting in line for a good location at the Flea Market, sometimes as early as three o'clock in the morning.


How To Be Successful


For two years he worked two jobs. On the weekdays he managed a sales staff and warehouse as well as leading his 10 staff people in canvassing small gift shops in the Bay Area; on weekends he sold at the Flea Market. Lee's wife shared his ambition and soon the two decided to try a third venture, a restaurant featuring a Mongolian BBQ in South San Jose.


Wife Lillian managed this 175 person capacity restaurant, introducing some Chinese dishes to the menu. Soon the Tungs discovered that their Mandarin dishes were the most popular, so they changed the name to Gobi, after the Gobi Desert which runs along China's north border. In 1987, the Tungs introduced a new innovation: weekend entertainment and music for their customers. They installed a KARA OK sound system where customers can sing along with taped music.


EIC Networking


In 1987 Lee Tung became acquainted with the EIC Group, Electronics International Company, a multi-million dollar land investment firm. He began working with them in real estate sales, selling commercial office real estate in the Lancaster area of southern California.


""I found a new challenge in real estate that I truly enjoyed,"" says Tung. ""It enabled me to help many of my fellow Taiwanese who wanted to buy their first piece of U.S. property."" Next Lee and Chen Wang, the founder of the EIC Group, discussed the possibility of an office in Santa Clara County. Just last month, EIC's San Jose office was opened in grand style, complete with firecrackers, lion dancers and a ribbon cutting in the center of Lion Plaza. The San Jose office is a general realty office with plans to open a mortgage company soon. Also, Lee's EIC branch will sell limited partnerships on property in the Bahamas and Lancaster, California.


Lee's Call Me Dragon restaurants in the International Food Court of Lion Plaza have also just opened, specializing in Dim Sum, Taiwan snack items and noodles. In conjunction with these new restaurants. Lee opened his Catering Hall Company using the large adjoining hall in Lion Plaza.


Victor Chao is the Managing Director of their Call Me Dragon Catering Hall. ""Our company provides everything for this hall, full service round table seating capacity up to 500, modern disco dancing, full sound equipment with programmed lighting effects, and over 600 available parking spaces,"" he says, adding, ""Our Call Me Dragon restaurants as well as our full service kitchen can produce a wide selection of menu packages' including Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Continental cuisine. In addition we have a bandstand available for live music and reasonable pricing on everything from a simple buffet to an elegant 12 course banquet dinner.""


Everything But The Kitchen Sink


Lee Tung laughs, saying, ""With our restaurant and hall capabilities, we want to provide the total wedding package for Asian couples, taking them through every step from the early wedding plans to the banquet or reception. My restaurants can provide the food, and my realty firm can even buy the young newlyweds their first home. Now, don't you agree that that's truly full service?""


Lee's and Victor's enthusiasm for the future plans and proposals of the company knows no bounds. Lee is offering a special bonus to parties ordering more than 20 tables (200 people). For such large parties, Call Me Dragon Entertainment Company will offer, gratis, a band of your ethnic choice, whether it be Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese or American music. And in true Japanese tradition, you can even provide KARA OK singalong for your guests too.


New Horizons


Lee Tung, one must remember, likes to face challenges, and this Year of the Dragon promises to present many different business hurdles. Besides establishing an EIC Group for investors in. Santa Clara County, Tung hopes to set up a travel agency and insurance office to add to his Lion Plaza Suite of offices. San Jose resident Leah Liao is the office supervisor working with Tung and Chao in the new San Jose office. Now Lee and Mr. Liao can add counseling newlyweds on where to go on their honeymoon and how to buy life insurance to their full wedding service package.


Victor and Lee are anxious to work with business proprietors and corporate managers on setting up business parties, seminars and meetings in thier hall facility. They also look forward to hosting private parties, for example anniversaries, birthdays, and baby receptions. If you're ready to book your next party, contact Tung Lee or Victor Chao for a visit to the hall facilities and a sampling of the restaurant's fare. They may be contacted through Call Me Dragon, (408) 226-6222.


Lee Tung continues to pursue challenges just as the dragon pursues happiness and prosperity, according to to Chinese legend. Actually, with his new EIC Group office, his full service entertainment and catering business and Gobi's Restaurant, he is more like a dragon on the run.

SAN FRANCISCO -- ""I've never done this before.""


The tall, dark, handsome stranger laughs as he walks down San Francisco's Clement Street on a warm Indian summer afternoon.


""Hi! I'm Rod McLeod. I'm running for school board. I'd appreciate your vote,"" he smiles as he hands his campaign flyer to everyone he meets.


Appointed to San Francisco's school board by then Mayor Dianne Feinstein more than a year ago, McLeod is running for his first full term. He is the only Filipino American on San Francisco's Board of Education. McLeod has a mixture of Filipino, and Scottish ancestry. The candidate is also an attorney at Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison.


If McLeod and Dr. Leland Yee, a child psychologist, win their bids for seats on the school board, the Asian American community will have nearly one-third representation on the seven-member board. Eleven candidates are running for four seats on the board.


""Leland and I are not competitors. I'd like to see him on the board with me,"" McLeod said.


""I'm not a politician,"" McLeod said as he walks hand in hand with Jessica, his eight-year-old daughter.


McLeod hands a campaign flyer to a woman. She looks at the photo of McLeod and his family and looks up to McLeod. She looks down at the flyer and up again to McLeod.


""What are you doing with an Irish name?"" she asks.


""My dad is Scottish and my mom is Filipino -- and my wife is Korean,"" McLeod responds.


""That's a wonderful combination!"" she exclaims as her eyes light up behind her sunglasses.


""Are you going to vote for you, Daddy?"" Jessica asks as she clutches a batch of McLeod for School Board flyers.


""I sure am,"" McLeod replies.


McLeod stops, smiles, looks directly at and talks to everyone he meets. From sidewalk coffee shops to clothing stores, he chats with everyone. The universal reaction is one of pleasant surprise that a candidate is actually canvassing voters personally.


""I'm not a voter,"" one bystander said.


""Then talk to a voter for me,"" McLeod replies.


McLeod is working a precinct drop on his campaign. A precinct drop is a route candidates and their volunteers take through a given neighborhood as they hand out campaign flyers or brochures in order to encourage people to vote and support their campaign.


""There are 715 precincts in San Francisco,"" according to McLeod. ""We need a minimum of 75,000 votes to win.""


According to McLeod, $30,000 has been raised for his campaign. He is trying to raise an additional $15,000 to $20,000 for his projected $50,000 campaign budget.


McLeod has a goal of 100 precinct captains, whose responsibility is to walk precincts before election day on behalf of their candidates. There are between 40 and 50 McLeod precinct captains so far. Overseeing his campaign is his paid campaign manager, John Rubin.


""I like people on a basic level. People pick that up,"" McLeod said.


McLeod strikes out at a liquor store and a restaurant. ""Coffee shops are OK, but not restaurants.""


Why not? asks a reporter.


""People don't like to be interrupted during a meal, but they will chat over coffee,"" he responds.


Nearly everyone takes a McLeod flyer, which specifically details his next term's agenda. McLeod is batting nearly a thousand until he gets to the West Portal district.


One woman refuses to take McLeod's campaign brochure. ""I'm not going to vote -- especially for someone like you!"" she sneers as her bulky frame stomps down the street.


McLeod laughs. ""Yes, I have a thick skin. I can't take this seriously. Some people are not going to vote for me, so I don't worry about it. I'm a trial attorney. I'm trained to go into court against people I don't know to argue my case. But no one group can elect a winner. I have to go for everyone.


""However it is natural that one relies on a group of people who are close supporters who work for you on weekends. We need more than just the Filipino American community,"" McLeod declares. ""If I can distribute enough of my flyers, we'll do OK. It sets a standard and tells people what we are all about.""


McLeod has some good ideas for his next term on the school board: neighborhood study centers where children can study and receive tutoring after school, master-teacher program with higher salaries for outstanding teachers to keep them in the classroom instead of administration, and providing necessary remedial instruction for students in elementary school while there is still time for them to catch up.


He walks by a voter registration table. One of the volunteers takes a McLeod flyer. ""Lets see what you're for,"" she said.


""Something positive -- long range looking."" McLeod responds.


Jessica, McLeod's daughter, complains about the summer heat. ""I want some ice cream, Daddy!""


""OK,"" he smiles as he enters a Baskins-Robbins ice cream shop.


While he orders ice cream for his daughter, McLeod hands his flyers to the counterpersons. ""I'd appreciate your vote."" After a leisurely snack with Jessica, McLeod ""works the shops"" by handing his flyers to every customer.


""People who take brochures are indicative of how open they are. ""Those who don't take them appear not to want to be bothered with and don't want to get involved,"" McLeod observes.


Undaunted, he hands one flyer to a blonde woman walking down the street. ""I got one already,"" she replies.


""Did you read it?"" he asked.


""Yes,"" she replies.


""We should do well in this district,"" McLeod muses as he scans the West Portal neighborhood. McLeod has distributed 150 flyers in an hour during his walk through the Richmond and West Portal districts. Most of the recipients say that they will vote for him.


It's time for McLeod to head to his San Francisco house to drop Jessica off to her mom, don a quick change of clothes and head to the Filipino American Senior Opportunities Services Center in the Mission district.


While sipping tea, McLeod recalls the controversy over his decision to move his son from Commodore Sloat to St. Brandon's School.


""I moved my son to a parochial school for religious reasons. We thought long and hard about it. Religion is an important part of the Filipino American community,"" he said during a recent speech at a Chinese American Democratic Club endorsement meeting.


As soon as he enters the front door of the community center, McLeod works the crowded hall, shaking hands and posing for photos with his many admirers. His flyers are distributed to everyone in the hall. A McLeod ""Educating for the Future"" banner adorns the front door.


""This is a good day's work,"" he said. ""My weekend campaigning starts at 10 a.m. and ends at 5 p.m. There are picnics to go to, meetings with the Golden Gate Democratic Club, and scheduled endorsement events and receptions on weeknights. Some meetings and coffee parties take two to four hours a night. Then there are the morning bus stop precinct walks.""


Approximately 200 people in the predominantly Filipino American audience look with anticipation as McLeod grabs the microphone.


""I am here to honor you. Your generosity has made it possible for people like me to run for the school board. I have served 17 months on the board. I am the only Filipino American on the board. I have a very independent voice for reason and long-term structural change.


""I am sensitive to the needs of Filipino American immigrants and I bring a standard of excellence to the school board. Without a solid education, our children won't be able to achieve in this society,"" he continues.


""And vote by absentee ballot in November because its two ballot cards this time. Vote in the comfort of your own home,"" he concludes.


The hometown audience enthusiastically cheers for McLeod, ""their local boy made good."" ""McLeod for School Board"" buttons brightly adorn many a lapel in the audience. McLeod flyers are on every table. The campaign road may be long, but at least for McLeod, it's a smooth ride today.

LOS ANGELES -- ON Saturday, June 11, Nee Troung pushed her wheelchair up to the p;odium at Cal State L.A.'s University Stadium to receive her second B.S. degree -- this one in computer science (she earned her B.S. in electrical engineering at CSLA in 1985).


More than 3800 other students, many the first in their families to attend college, also received degrees, but none can claim the same measure of personal determination, spirit of survival and community support as Nee.


Nee Troung arrived in the U.S. from Vietnam in 1978. It was not until 1984 that she first visited the Westwood Village area. On July 27 -- the eve of the summer Olympics -- she was one of 53 people mowed down (one was killed; Nee was the most seriously injured of the survivors) when a crazed motorist sent his red Buick careening down a crowded sidewalk in a fit of rage, leaving the young woman paralyzed from the waist down and minus most of her right leg, noted a CSLA press release.


She says that the will to overcome her difficulties came, in part, from her CSLA engineering classes and instructors.


""We're taught that when a problem arises, there's always more than one way to solve it. Whether the problem is one of engineering or with life in general, I've learned not to become upset. Instead I become calm and take everything one step at a time. As soon as you've faced up to a problem, it's on its way to being solved.""


Nee and her family left Vietnam as ""boat people,"" arriving in America to adjust to a new language and culture. She graduated from Alhambra High School, then entered Cal State L.A. as an electrical engineering major. She was 17 units away from graduation when she and four of her friends decided to take in a movie in Westwood Village. Before she would return to her family's modest, two-bedroom Alhambra home, which she shares with her parents, sister and two younger brothers, she would undergo 12 grueling hours of intensive surgery to remove her spleen, place two metal rods in her spine and amputate her right leg below the knee. Doctors would tell her later that she would remain in a wheelchair, possibly for the rest of her life.


The outpouring of emotional support, especially from faculty and fellow students, was immediate and sincere. CSLA President James M. Rosser sent several letters to Nee. Stoney Martin, associate director of International Student Services, established the Committee to Benefit Nee Troung. A campus blood drive raised 41 units of much needed blood. Participants in the university's annual Swim/Walk/Jog-a-thon earmarked up to 50 percent of their contributions to Troung.


The need for such assistance was apparent from the onset. In addition to months of therapy at Rancho Los Amigos in Downey, Nee's special needs -- a special bed, wheelchair and other expensive equipment, plus special alterations to the family bathroom -- quickly shot her medical expenses up past $200,000 within months of the accident.


In spite of such adversity Troung managed to return to CSLA and receive her B.S. in electrical engineering 11 months after the accident. Now, with her second degree, she expects to enter the work force and establish her independence.


""After the accident it was like starting back from zero,"" recalls Nee, ""but everyone at Cal State L.S. made me feel truly a part of this campus community. I felt no isolation. Students and professors treated me with genuine concern. There was a sense of caring, of family.""


Throughout her long months of hospitalization Nee's parents visited her every day. Understandably the horrendous experience brought the family closer together, including her boyfriend, with whom she grew up in Can Tho. The both wear gold ""promise rings"" on their left hands.


She cherishes the family's closeness.

MONTEREY -- United States Army buildings at Defense Language Institute, Presidio of Monterey, are to be named in honor of two great WW II leaders of MISLS, Colonel Kai Rasmussen and John Aiso, Rasmussen passed away in March 1988 in Washington DC and John Aiso in December 1987 in Los Angeles.


The DLI Headquarters building will be named Kai Rasmussen Hall in honor of Colonel Kai Rasmussen, who had the vision and courage to propose the establishment of a Japanese military intelligence school for Japanese American soldiers at a time when prejudice and distrust of Niser prevailed. He doggedly persisted until a school was activated in November 1941 at the Presidio of San Francisco. As commandant of MISLS from 941 to 1946, he provided the military leadership for carrying out a critical intelligence operation at a time of national peril.


A recently completed academic library will be named John Aiso Memorial Library in honor of John Aiso, the one person most responsible for implementing the War Department's program of training soldiers in Japanese military combat intelligence. As chief instructor in 1941 and as director of academic training from 1942 to 1946, Aiso brilliantly executed his mission by turning out 6000 graduates who contributed significantly to victory in the Pacific War.


A double dedication of Kai Rasmussen Hall and John Aiso. Memorial Library is planned in conjunction with a celebration of the 47th anniversary of DLI during the last weekend of October 1988.


The ceremony honoring these two great WW II leaders will tell a wonderful story of America at its best: a Danish-born naturalized American soldier working with a second-generation Japanese American to carry out a critical intelligence mission in national defense.

SAN FRANCISCO -- It used to be ladies first, but not these days. And certainly not when dishes are to be picked up after a meal.


When it comes to having a waiter pick up the pieces after a meal in the '80s -- it's all up for grabs.


So says the instructor who replied to a question posed by a student enrolled in the bartending and waiter skills employment program run by Chinatown's Charity Cultural Services Center.


During the 10-week waiter and bartending program up to 15 immigrants who qualify for the program are trained for jobs in the restaurant industry. Since this program began, over 200 students have graduated to secure jobs locally as bartenders and waiters. Iris Wang, assistant director of CCSC, added that students in the program intern at restaurants to sharpen their skills and gain valuable on-site experience.


In addition to this program CCSC operates a successful Chinese cooking employment program under the direction of Keung Wong.


Wong, who has directed the program since it began operation four years ago, said he enjoys his job and complimented cooking teacher and Yet Wah Restaurant chef Ching Hing Moon, who conducts classes for the progam in the center's kitchen.


The 20-week cooking course trains students at the school site as well as at restaurant locations. Two hundred and seventy students have graduated from this program to secure jobs that bring in an average of $12,000 per year.


And like the bartending/waiter program the course also includes English language training. In addition Wong pointed out that students work to gain a sanitation certificate that boosts their opportunities for employment.

EEOC


You know you're in trouble when you get a busy signal for 20 minutes, then when you finally get through and ask for your party they put you on hold for another five minutes. That's what happened to me when I was trying to telephone the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the other day. When I lost my patience waiting for my party, I got on another line and phoned the commission to tell the operator she had forgoteen me on hold.


The purpose of my call was to find out about the replacement entertainment industry task force which might clean up show business employment practices.


The last task force was headed by a woman who had worked at a network. She led a team comprised of a law student and a person who had worked behind-the-cameras on commercials. When they were formed the various ethnic communitys were asked to come in and talk with them about industry employment practices. I invited a few knowledgable Asian Pacific Americans from show business to the meeting, and we soon discovered the knowledge about the industry the task force had was sketchy at best. They were not given the tools they needed to do their job.


Prior to the formation of the task force, EEOC attorney Margaret Ryan (who was really on our side) and her colleagues did an extensive study of the entire entertainment industry's hiring practices from grip to director, go-fers to producers and extras to stunt performers. Several of us who had given information for the study were invited into the EEOC offices to review, under the watchful eye of staff, the extensive and detailed text. None of us were allowed to take any part of the study out of the EEOC offices. Rodney Mitchell who's in charge of affirmative action at the Screen Actors Guild and I were among theose who read the study. I was most impressed with Ryan's work because the study could have been the text for a four-year college course on how show biz works. The information was so thorough and good it has become to be known as ""the bible."" We had high hopes the material would be helpful in successfully pursuing discrimination charges.


But lo and behold! What should happen but the study just disappeared off the face of the earth. The last I heard the chairman of the commission in Washington, D.C. had it in his hands. But shortly thereafter I talked with a Mexican American commissioner, and he wanted to know if I had a copy of the study because he'd like to read it. Even a commissioner wasn't allowed to see it!


It was obvious the first entertainment industry task force had not seen the bible, and now I'm led to believe the replacement task force hasn't seen it either. The head of the new task force, Manuel Trujillo, said he'd heard about the study and wondered if it was the ""Window Dressing"" one. I told him no, that was the 1977 Civil Rights Commission Study, which was updated in 1979.


Now, I don't pretend to have an inkling of how government works, but it would seem to me that all that work Ryan and her colleagues did should not be wasted. I can't imagine what Clarence Thomas, the commission chair, could have done with the bible. A man that important couldn't have just mislaid the text or forgotten it on a plane You'd think he'd want all of the commissioners to study the material. I wonder if they have document shredders in the EEOC too!


Had the first task force read the bible, they wouldn't have said one could walk on the Universal Studios lot, look at a bulletin board and apply for technical positions. People with even a smidgen of show biz knowledge know job hunters can't just stroll on a studio lot. You have to have an appointment, otherwise the studios would be overrun with star-struck job applicants from Podunk and from every other city of the country, not only seeking acting work, but to become directors, producers and moguls too.


It appears the first entertainment industry task force has also fallen off the face of the earth. I asked around, and nobody seems to know what happened to its head, June Briggs, and her team.


I made an appointment to meet with the new three-member task force, but only met with two of them as Trujillo had to cancel because something came up at the office. The two who met with me made me swear that our conversation was confidential and off the record. I didn't learn anything earth shattering, and I still wish Clarence Thomas would find that bible so the commission can do its work.


At this time, unless one had an out and out clear-cut case of discrimination in show business, it shouldn't be filed. I don't think the commission is sufficiently motiated, equipped or willing to thoroughly pursue entertainment industry cases, at least not under the current administration in Washington.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Senator Pete Wilson this week blasted the Census Bureau for its proposals on how to count Asians and Pacific Islanders.


The Republican senator had harsh words for the bureau's complex proposals for determining the ethnic subgroups of Asian Pacifics in the 1990 Census. He made his remarks in a speech delivered to more than 200 supporters at a dinner Sunday at the Grand Palace Restaurant in Chinatown. The event raised some $20,000 for Wilson's reelection campaign.


In its question on race the bureau plans to ask Asian Pacifics to write in their ethnic subgroup -- i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, etc. -- rather than simply check a box as was required in the 1980 Census.


Critics charge that the write-in system would be confusing to many Asian Pacifics, resulting in a severe undercount of Asian Pacifics and thus curtailing the amount of funding available for social services for the ethnic communities.


Wilson recently joined Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii in demanding that the bureau return to the checkoff system used in 1980.


""We have put an amendment on the appropriations bill which provides the funds for the bureau's operation. The amendment requires that the bureau count Asians and Pacific Islanders in separate groups not by having them write it in but by checking a box,"" Wilson said to enthusiastic applause.


""It is important that we make it as easy as possible so it will be as accurate as possible,"" he added.


Of special concern is the possibility that Asian Pacifics might be lumped together into a single group by the bureau, rather than counted as separate subgroups.


Wilson vowed to hold the bureau to its word that the subgroups would be counted separately. ""There are vast differences between the various groups. What sense does it make to say they must all be counted together? The answer is that it makes no sense at all.""


On another topic dear to his listeners Wilson criticized the Kennedy-Simpson immigration bill for its negative impact on family reunification visas. Asians are especially concerned about maintaining ""fifth preference"" visas for adult brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. The new bill would restrict the visas to unmarried siblings aged 26 or younger.


Pointing out that three of his four grandparents were born in other countries, Wilson called for compassion for immigrants.


""I was one of only four senators who voted against the Kennedy Simpson bill because it would deprive us of many people we should be welcoming."" Wilson added that 63 percent of visa applications last year were made under the fifth preference.


""The Kennedy bill would force these people to choose between marrying or getting to come to America, because if you were married, you would be pushed down the list"" of applicants waiting the chance to immigrate, he said.


Turning to allegations that major universities throughout the country have informally limited the number of Asians admitted as freshmen, Wilson called on educators to open their doors to deserving students.


""There must be no quotas on opportunity, just as there must be no quota on students of any ethnicity. And admissions should be based on merit.""


The senator saluted successful Asian American students, particularly those who have won recognition in such prestigious competitions as the Westinghouse National Science Talent Search. He pointed out that his wife Gayle also won the Westinghouse competition as a youngster.


He criticized the mood in Congress to restrict foreign access to American markets in retaliation for the huge trade surpluses accumulated by such nations as Japan and Taiwan.

LOS ANGELES -- Although Republican presidential candidate George Bush is not able to meet with Asian American community leaders and politicians in an L.A. Chinatown square next Thursday, his wife Barbara will attend the 1:30 p.m. welcoming rally that is expected to attract some 1000 people.


According to organizers, Mrs. Bush's 30-minute visit in Chinatown will include viewing a short program of festive lion dancers, a performance by Asian children and time for Bush to deliver a speech and circulate in the crowd.


The visit was confirmed just last week when L.A. Community College Board member Julie Wu personally extended the invitation to Bush headquarters in Washington on behalf of Los Angeles Asian American organizations.


""Several key organizations extended an invitation to Bush and Mrs. Bush to visit, and this time Mrs. Bush will come first,"" Wu told Asian Week. ""After the national convention it is highly possible that Vice President Bush will visit.""


The organizations that invited Bush include the Asian American Republican Women, Federation of World Indo Chinese Organizations, Federation of Chinese American Organizations and the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association.


Wu believes that Bush has a lot of support in the Asian American community of Los Angeles and commends him for stating that if elected president, he will consider appointing Asians to important decision-making positions.


""I think Asian Americans find Bush has a lot of international experience and has had a lot of exposure to the Asian people and Asian culture,"" said Wu. ""I would say he is a moderate Republican, and I think he shares similar traditional concepts with Asians. Personally I feel that Bush is pretty sensitive and wants to reach out to the community.""


Wu, who has been involved in Republican presidential campaigns since 1960, is experienced in coordinating key politicans' visits to Los Angeles' Chinatown.


She was the key coordinator during President Ford's wife Betty's memorable visit in 1976, which Wu recalls was a success and received plenty of media attention.


We said her close relationship with Bush's campaign goes back to 1980 when she was involved with the Reagan-Bush campaign. And as a longtime member of the U.S. Commission on Library Information and Science, which is a federal agency appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, Wu has opportunities to meet with key politicians.


She said Mrs. Bush in particular takes a great interest in the U.S. Commission on Library Information and Science and is actively involved with the commission.


""Personally I do have a lot of contact with Bush, and she works closely with us on education issues and especially on the literacy program,"" said Wu.

Immigrants applying for legalization after April 4 will have an extra 60 days after the May 5 application deadline to file supporting documents, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service announced March 18.


Immigrant advocates denounced the change as a ploy by the INS to defuse their drive for a one-year extension of the application deadline.


INS Commissioner Alan Nelson and Attorney General Edwin Meese argued that the new policy makes any further extension unnecessary.


""The application can be completed in less than 30 minutes,"" Nelson said.


""Without the requirement of immediate documentation, there is no reason for any qualified applicant not to file by the May 4 deadline.""


Applications are far below the INS predictions. Out of an estimated 3.9 million eligible for legalization, only 1.4 million have applied.


Anyone who can prove having been in the United States in violation of immigration law since before Jan. 1, 1982 is eligible for legalization.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Chinatown YMCA is continuing its half century tradition to offering boys and girls the opportunity to explore nature this summer through its various camping programs.


The Chinatown YMCA has offered its camping programs since the 1930s. Lim P. Lee and Henry S. Tom were among the first Chinatown residents to take youngsters to camp outside The City. With such a long history behind them, it is no wonder that the Y programs are an established tradition of the Chinatown community.


The Boys High Sierra Residence Camp at Camp Olijato, Huntington Lake, has existed over 50 years and offers boys ages 9 through 16 activities like archery, backpacking, boating and canoeing, campfires, crafts, music, swimming and even riflery. To stress values of ""responsible community living, environmental awareness, outdoor skills and nature study,"" the campers are divided into small groups with campers of their own ages. Each group is led by a trained counselor through the various activities. This year Boys Camp will run Aug. 6-14 and is sure to be a valuable outdoor experience the campers will always remember.


In 1957, the Tri-Y (Girls) camp was added to the camping programs. At Girls Camp participants sleep in cabins, experience the joys of outdoor cooking, hike, canoe, swim and participate in a nature program, archery and campfires.


At Jones Gulch near La Honda, girls from ages 9 through 15 can become part of the ""Y family"" through a Special Raggers ceremony that welcomes new members and honors Raggers who continue their commitment to the program. Girls Camp is offered from Aug. 7-12.


During the same year the Tri-Y camp was established, 10 girls joined the boys camp at Olijato for the weekend. Since then the Chinatown YMCA has offered co-educational camp programs. For older teens the Chinatown Y, offers Campference also at Jones Gulch, for both boys and girls from ages 15 to 19. Beginning on Aug. 14 and ending Aug. 19, campers explore miles of hiking trails, visit ocean beaches, participate in recreational activities like archery and volleyball, swim in a 100' by 100' outdoor pool, and enjoy campfires, a Raggers ceremony and a dance.


The Y also offers a two-week specialty camp from Aug. 15. The focus of the camps is on sports, arts and crafts and outdoor education.


At all camps food and medical services are provided and there is a program staff of volunteers from the community to help manage the programs. Campers learn the values of cooperation and teamwork during their camping period, through participating in various chores.


According to George Lai, camp director for the Chinatown YMCA, campers learn the ideal of community living on a two-night backpack trip. They learn to share their food and shelter as well as how to help others.


Through counseling and the Raggers program, the camp also offers ""character building,"" and values such as loyalty, service to others and leadership in the community.


More than ever before, immigrants are participating in the camping programs, adding a new dimension to the learning experience. Native born youth interacts with immigrant youth, stimulating assimilation among the immigrants and opening the opportunity for native born to explore, understand and appreciate their cultural heritage.


For those unable to pay the cost of the camping programs, Chinatown youth can participate in the ""Earn Your Way Program"" by selling Y-bars. For each case of candies sold, the camper receives $13.50 towards payment for the camping fee. The Y Also provides subsidies and partial camperships to a limited number of campers based on financial need.


To help benefit the YMCA's camp programs and continue their tradition, the Chinatown YMCA is sponsoring ""A Night at Monte Carlo"" on Saturday July 16 from 7 p.m. to midnight at 855 Sacramento Street (Chinatown YMCA) in San Francisco. There will be prizes, door prizes, grand prizes and a raffle. For more information contact the Chinatown YMCA at (415) 982-4412.

You may have noticed that the San Francisco Sheriff's Department is conducting a recruitment drive for new deputy sheriffs.


Perhaps you read about it in Asian Week, or maybe you saw our posters and flyers around Chinatown or in the Richmond neighborhoods. It's possible you have received a direct notification in the mails, heard it broadcast on a Chinese public affairs radio program or received a brochure at a street fair or public festival.


The point is, we are a strong and visible presence in the Asian community -- as we were in our 1984 and 1986 recruitment drives, and as we will be when we again recruit two years from now.


The results of our long-term commitment to hire Chinese American men and women deputies are immediately obvious. Currently, we have 40 Asian male and female officers in the department -- fully 10 percent of our total force. A recent survey of major law enforcement agencies across the nation showed they had an average of less than 1 percent Asian officers in each of their department.


But why create a recruitment outreach program to Chinatown, the Richmond, Japantown and a host of other Asian communities throughout the Bay Area?


Throughout the long histories of police and public safety agencies in this country minorities and women have been traditionally denied equal employment opportunities. The reasons for this have varied, according to the false rationale of each historic era, but its basis was always rooted in cultural ignorance, sexism, or longstanding tradition. And, yes, racism.


Genuine attempts to break through these prejudices by law enforcement executives and elected officials were long in coming and are still very sluggish in most areas. The old myths hang on long after they've been disproven by experience and common sense, and even after strong anti-discrimination laws have been placed in the books.


Certain groups ""just can't do the job,"" we're told. They're ""too weak,"" it's said; others are ""too short or too lazy."" Yet another group has ""poor vision and can't see well enough"" to perform the duties required. These and many other likewise spurious arguments have been used for decades to bar the hiring of women and minorities for police and fire safety jobs.


Those illogical prejudices were wrong then, they're even more odious in today's more enlightened and homogeneous American society.


As we move beyond the traditions of discrimination, past the passage of overdue civil rights statutes, and into an era of what should be de facto employment opportunities for everyone, it becomes clear that the only way we can overcome the mistakes of the past is by implementing proactive policies today.


It is not enough to announce a commitment to equal opportunity: we must reach out and bring those opportunities directly to those who have been traditionally underrepresented. We must meet with community leaders and activists, work with minority media, go into the neighborhoods and turn words into action.


The results are inevitable and satisfying. In our case, we have a department with the highest women and minority representation of any major law enforcement in the nation: fully 60 percent of our total sworn staff!


We recruit in the Asian community because it is right. And we recruit in the Asian community because it makes us a better, more effective Sheriff's Department. And that, after all is said and done, should be the goal of any good organization.


To receive more information about the San Francisco Sheriff's Department current recruitment drive for the position of deputy sheriff call the Recruitment Hotline at 554-7000 or come in person to our recruitment desk in Room 333, City Hall at Van Ness and McAllister Streets.


Starting salary is $30,511 per year, increasing after three years to $35,209. Applicants must be at least 20 years old.

LOS ANGELES -- A large crowd gathered under the scorching sun at TRW in Redondo Beach to show support for Vice President George Bush's candidacy for president of the United States.


Bush acknowledged the presence of the many Asian organizations in the audience.


""Some of you who have come from Europe or Asia know what I am about to say is true. I count my blessings for the freedoms that we have. As president of the United States I will never apologize for the United States of America, and I will keep her strong, and I will use our moral stength to stand up for those who are fighting for liberty, freedom and democracy around the world. We are the party of opportunity, we are the party that says to new Americans, 'You're welcomed here.'""


Thunderous applause greeted Bush's comments on the defense program.


""I am here to pledge you my support for a strong defense and a strong space program in the future. National security depends on our president being able to talk to whomever from a position of strength and not of weakness. [President Reagan] went to Moscow and talked not from weakness but from strength, and as a result of that we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age that bans an entire generation of these weapons.""


Bush also stressed the importance of education and educators in his speech.


""The answer to our ability to compete in the future... the answer for the disadvantaged, the answer for so many people in this country is a better education. I want to be the education president. I'm not suggesting that the federal government comes into the classrooms of California. I don't believe in that. I'm saying we can do better from the White House encouraging those good teachers, encouraging those principles, the four R's -- reading, 'riting, 'rithmetic and respect in the classroom.""


Inside the TRW building Bush toured the satellite facilities where he viewed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. He also met with leaders of the Bob Dole for President campaign in California who formally announced their support of Bush.


In a letter to Willim Brock of the Dole for President Committee, the Dole supporters expressed their reasons for supporting Bush.


""Our most important goal has always been to ensure that we have a Republican sitting in the White House in 1988.... It is becoming increasingly clear to us that Senator Dole will not be our party's nominee this fall...we now feel compelled to join the vice president's campaign and begin the process of unifying the California Republican Party to ensure that we are able to deliver California in November.""


Bush pledged to them ""I will conduct myself... in a way that will not only unify our party, speaking ill of no other Republican, but in a way that broadens the base of the Republican Party.""


The rally concluded with the presentation of flowers to Mrs. Bush by a young Vietnamese girl who said, ""We, the Vietnamese Americans, express our deepest gratitude for your love and help of the Vietnamese.""

LOS ANGELES -- The Chinatown Community Advisory Committee has recommended three of the five proposals for the Chinatown Cultural and Community Center to the Community Redevelopment Agency for further evaluation.


The proposals are those presented by the Lippo Group, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and Pacific Dynasty Building, Ltd. According to Gayle Anderson of the Community Redevelopment Agency, the evaluation process will take about 45 days as staff evaluate the feasibility, drawbacks and advantages of each plan.


Susan Totaro, acting Chinatown project manager, said the CRA will review all five proposals with a special emphasis on those recommended by the CCAC. The CRA will consider the design, program and technical aspects of each proposal, and Totaro hopes the process will be a speedy one.


Victor Huey, aide to Los Angeles Councilwoman Gloria Molina, praised the recent accelerated progress of the project. Molina spearheaded efforts to get the project in motion.

Philip Wong is a man on the move. At the tender age of 23, he has had his foot in the door of a half a dozen businesses. ""I hope in my lifetime to have the opportunity to explore many new areas of business. There are many opportunities in America for immigrants such as myself and it is up to the individual to make the most of them,"" he said.


Family Legacy


Philip comes from a business-oriented family. His grandparents in China brought the first permanent hair curling machines and hair salons to Shanghai in 1910. His mother was a commercial art designer and his father an electrical engineer who saw their occupational freedom restricted during China's Communist regime. Philip and his family came to America when he was 12, settling in Sunnyvale, California where they had relatives.


Philip recalls the first six months of adjustment as difficult because the language and culture were so different. Going right into Sunnyvale High School at an early age, he learned his English through English as a Second Language classes and from the Americanized cousins with whom he lived.


Young and Industrious


Philip was always very industrious. He took on after school jobs as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant, a Kentucky Fried Chicken cook, a gas station operator and an electronics assembler during those years. Upon graduating, he became the youngest car salesman at Pete Ellis Dodge where he was an immediate top seller due to his ability to speak Chinese, his able salesmanship and his youthful enthusiasm.


He soon realized this job was not for him no matter how lucrative it was, and decided to go to DeAnza Community College to study business. In 1983, his school life was interrupted because his mother decided to open a Chinese restaurant. She needed Philip to help manage her Shanghai Restaurant in East San Jose. Although he was kept busy there and attending night school, Philip's active spirit got bored, and he started searching for new occupational avenues.


A Start in the Printing Business


Philip's friend, Han Nguyen, was studying printing at Mission College and had a printing press in his garage as a hobby. In Han's garage in 1985, the two decided to start their own printing business called L.B. Printing Company, Lithography for the Bay Area. Philip used all the contacts he had made through his restaurant and was the salesman and finance and marketing planner for the business with Han handling the production end.


""I saw that the small businesses in Silicon Valley had a need for printing facilities at that time and knew there was an opening for us in this competitive market,"" he explained. ""We struggled in the beginning to make our inroads to the business, but there were many generous suppliers who supported us. They sensed our youthful spirit and industriousness and many times extended credit beyond normal standards because they knew we would work hard to survive.""


Philip saw more Asians moving into the high tech small business realm and worked hard to include them in his client base. Soon the business duo needed more warehouse space so they moved out of the garage and are now a full capacity standard American printing house under one roof, bringing books from scratch to finished product. They renamed themselves Impression, and are located at 1713 Rogerts St., San Jose.


Wong Brothers Moving Co.


Philip bought a truck to make pick ups and deliveries from the print shop. He soon saw, however, that his deliveries didn't keep the truck busy enough to justify its purchase. So he and his brother Stanley Wong decided to use it for a moving business. He approached friends in electronic firms he had met through the printing company and asked them to consider. Wong Brothers Moving Co. for their moving concerns. Soon the truck was busy moving office furniture and equipment and another one of Philip Wong's ideas had blossomed into a full-fledged successful business.


With the growth of Asians into the Silicon Valley, Philip sensed that there was a niche for an Asian owned moving company in the residential area also. ""Asians are always looking to upgrade themselves and move into better neighborhoods for their children's schooling. We decided to shift our emphasis onto this growing need and now do predominantly household moving,"" he said.


Immediately the young men were busy and now have two teams of moving crews totalling eight workers. No longer the muscles behind the moves, Philip now oversees one team and spends most evenings soliciting clients.


When he visits potential customers he makes a detailed inspection and gives a cost estimate, then discusses moving preparation and stresses the importance of proper packing and cooperation to make the move as easy as possible. The customers seem to sense he is as sincere and thorough as he is enterprising; Philip is happy to report that he gets almost 98 percent sales response from his visits.


Wong Brothers Moving Co. moves people all over the greater Bay Area. Many of their clients today are referrals from the satisfied customers they have serviced during their one short year of existence. Officer Manager Kim keeps the busy scheduling in order and the company moves at least one household daily. Philip admits to being a workaholic; right now he works 16 hour days. But he loves doing it because it's his own business.


Commitment to the Asian Communtiy


As if young Philip isn't kept busy enough overseeing two businesses-- Impression Lithography Company and Wong Brothers Moving Company-- he has added another dimension to his work week. He is acting in an advisory capacity to the newly opened San Jose office of the EIC Group Inc., a land development and investment company.


Philip explored the motivations behind his unrelentless ambition. ""Certainly the money rewards are nice, but basically I love working hard because I want to attain an image and reputation in the Asian American community. I feel blessed because I am a man from a Chinese background with an American education. With these two assets working for me, I hope to work with the Asian community and help myself and others make it in the American mainstream.""


His pager started beeping and business demands sent him off and running. Who knows what other business challenges face this undaunted young man. Whatever they are, Philip Wong is eager and ready to meet them head on. That is, if this moving man can stand still long enough.

I met Gov. Michael Dukakis for the first time just about a year ago. He and I and a dozen Asian Americans were together in a small holding area. We were waiting for the governor to be introduced to a large crowd of Asian Americans who came to hear him. We asked many questions, questions that are important to our community. Attentive to everyone who questioned him, the governor came across as a leader who is knowledgeable, caring, and very much in touch with real people like ourselves who work hard, value our family and are full of ethnic pride, who prize education and the opportunity to build a better live for ourselves. And a future full of promise for our children and our children's children.


I met the governor again six months later, this time at the invitation of Congressmen Norm Mineta and Bob Matsui. It was not a fundraiser. There were 30 Asian Pacific Americans in the room. After making a short speech, he took time to chat with us, in two's and three's. We were not shy in telling him what's on our mind: family reunification, the cruelty of years of separation while waiting for a sister or a brother's immigration number to come up. Vincent Chin, university admission quotas, the need for a positive environment for business, especially for small business, executive appointments to policy-making position in government. We poured out our fears and our concerns. He listened and he listened hard. It was clear to me that our messages sank deeply into his mind.


When my turn came for a one-on-one chat with Gov. Dukakis. I asked him for his record of appointing members of our community to state government in Massachusetts. He told me of his Asian American appointment to the board of regents of the University of Massachusetts, to the state's Civil Service Commission. He reminded me to get in touch with his office for an up-to-date list. (I did. In two weeks I received several pages of names, addresses and positions of his Asian American appointees. I was impressed by the credibility of this man and the efficiency of his office).


On a more personal level I asked Gov. Dukakis what he missed most in his daily life now that he had to spend time running for president. Quietly and almost wistfully, he said. ""Not being able to have dinner with my family at six every night."" As governor he made time to come home for dinner and then head back to his office, because time with family is precious on his scale of priorities.


I have followed closely, since our last meeting, Gov. Dukakis's statements and his proven record on issues that are important to us Asian Americans:


He believes in a strong partnership between business and government. Together we'll build a positive environment for private enterprise. Dr. An Wang, founder of Wang Laboratories has said it well - Gov. Dukakis has a proven record of creating the ""right atmosphere"" for business.


While I applaud President Reagan for appointing, in this election year, Elaine Chao and Dr. Sherwin Chan to high positions in his administration. Gov. Dukakis has long recognized the contributions of Asian Americans and appointed many to serve in his administration.


Gov. Dukakis served his military duty in Korea. He took time to learn Korean while he was there. This first-hand experience deepened his understanding of the threat of communism. There is nothing like spending time along the DMZ to understand how precious democracy is.


Kitty Dukakis, as long as seven years ago, labored hard and effectively to help Southeast Asian refugees to reunite with their families in the United States. Gov. Dukakis has advocated preferential categories for reuniting, families and special visas to visit the U.S. to ease the pain of family members while waiting for their immigration number to come up.


Many of us from middle-income families, under the Dukakis plan, can send our children to college with loans to be paid off over their working life. No longer will we be caught in the painful position of being too rich to quality for government aid but too poor to support our sons and daughters in college.


Gov. Dukakis values deeply the right of the individual, rich or poor. He belongs to an organization that defends the right of ordinary citizens such as Virginia Mitchell, who tried to get a complete copy of her school district's budget; and Gerald Sheridan, who was rejected as a police candidate, who had lost his left index finger as a boy but who is a Navy veteran and an expert marksman (he's right-handed); and Tim Calonita, who had Hodgkin's diseaes as a teen-ager but has been healthy for 11 years, when they applied for jobs.


Unlike former White House Chief of Staff Michael Deaver and dozens and dozens of former senior members of the Reagn/Bush administration who had the money to by the best legal talent to plead their cases, these ordinary citizens, Virginia Gerald and Tim, depend on this organization to fight for their rights. (The three are Republicans and white). The organization is the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union. I am proud that Gov. Dukakis is a member of the ACLU. I am saddened that Vice President Bush, who said that he wants to build a gentler, kinder America has seen fit to ridicule Dukakis for being a member of the ACLU. The causes that the ACLU supports may not be popular, but the fight for an individual's right against established authority helps to build a gentler and kinder American for all of us, not just for a chosen few.


Why I am for Gov. Dukakis? Because I want a proven leader, a thoughtful leader, a caring leader, a strong leader. Together we will build a gentler, kinder America, which respects our values. An America full of promise for our children. And our chil-dren's children.

SAN FRANCISCO-- ""On Nov. 8 the citizens of San Francisco, by an overwhelming majority, voted 'no' on bigotry and bad medicine,"" Dr. Frank C. Hudson told reporters at the opening of a press conference, which kicked off a new public education campaign aimed at reaching thousands of blood transfusion recipients who may have been exposed to the AIDS virus.


Dr. Hudson, president of the West Bay Hospital Conference, referred to the controversial Proposition 102, which would have removed the right of confidentiality for those who test positive for AIDS, as a contrast to what he considers saner, more prudent and more humanitarian joint efforts by the community to combat the spread of the disease.


One such effort is now being undertaken by the West Bay Hospital Conference, which is an association of 28 hospitals in San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties. The media blitz, officially initiated on Tuesday, is actually the second step in a campaign which has as its target about 115,000 people in the Bay Area who, hospital records show, received blood transfusions from 1978 through April 1985.


Dr. James Rumack, epidemiologist at Seton Medical Center, summed up the three major points that the conference's public education campaign aims to emphasize: First, that recipients of blood transfusions during the critical high risk period of 1978 through 1985 (particularly in 1982) should have themselves tested for HIV immediately; second, that early detection of the virus in such high risk persons is critical to the prompt intervention, diagnosis and treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related conditions; third, that the goal of the campaign is to inform those infected that AIDS is transmitted through sex and the mixing of blood, as in the sharing of needles by drug users or the passage of blood from a mother to her fetus.


Over the past year the hospitals have sent out about 60,000 letters to those found to be at risk but about 30 percent of those people were never reached, mostly due to address changes. Some people who were contacted, however, just failed to understand the implications of the letters.


""Some people just aren't aware,"" explained Dr. Stephen Follansbee, medical director for the Institute for HIV Research Treatment at Davies Medical Center. ""They may have had a transfusion during surgery years ago and then when they received notification that they were at risk it just didn't sink in, or they didn't want it to sink in. So it takes some dialogue between the person and his or her physician in order to convince these people to get tested.""


The escalating number of these cases looms ominously over the future despite statistics which show that about half of blood transfusion recipients die soon after due to complications resulting from their original disease. This would cut the original number of 115,000 people presumed to be at risk in half. Still, according to Dr. Michael Busch, associate scientific director of the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, the number of transfusion-related AIDS cases has risen from two to three percent nationally and will soon be the second fastest growing category of AIDS cases. In 1992 the cases will probably reach a peak in the Bay Area due to the long remission period of the HIV virus, Dr. Busch said. That is because 1982, when one percent of the blood bank was infected, was the peak risk period for transfusion recipients. The virus commonly takes ten years to develop fully.


Dr. Busch remarked on the fact that the percentage of transfusion-related AIDS cases in the Bay Area which has such a large gay population is about three percent, the same as the nationwide percentage. ""The amazing thing is that in 1983, when we first became aware that AIDS could be spread through blood, the gay community immediately stopped donating blood. As a result the risk dropped dramatically and the number of transfusion-related cases did not escalate.""


While the West Bay Hospital Conference, with the help of the media, continues the struggle to bring its message to the community, the need for viable blood donors increases. According to Dr. Busch, the number of Asian donors at Irwin Memorial Blood Bank is disproportionately low. ""Only about two percent of our donorship is Asian, which is a shame because Asians have rare blood types,"" he said. Although Asians currently have the fastest growing number of AIDS cases, the Asian community as a whole still accounts for the lowest percentage of those infected with the disease of any ethnic group. In fact, said Dr. Busch, ""We haven't identified a single infected Asian donor.""


Anyone interested in joining the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank may do so by calling 567-6400.

DALY CITY -- Is there such a thing as someone who loves too much? Why of course, says Lynn Werner. That's why she organized YWCA's weekly support group, ""Women Who Love Too Much.""


The group, based loosely on the best seller of the same title, meets each Thursday evening at Daly City's San Mateo County Center to . . . their feelings in a safe environment and work together to overcome the problems that stem in part from loving men too much.


Werner explained that for some women intense caring expresses itself in a destructive or addictive relationship. And often such relationships form because the women's childhood needs for affection and attention were insufficiently met.


""They try to get the response from the man that they didn't get (as children) and they deny their own needs by devoting all of their time to him,"" says Werner, who added that these women generally have low self-esteem.


""They take on the role as the caregiver and pick a man who has problems in the hope that he will get better,"" says Werner. ""They try to get the response they didn't get.""


She said such a woman may also have grown up in an alcoholic or abusive family or grown up without a sense that she is a good person.


Werner explains that participants find support and strength in the group meetings she heads.""


""When the women get together in the group, they can experience their feelings together and realize that they are not alone."" She said often the women in these types of relationships think they are always at fault, but in the support group they learn that they're not at fault.


The support group that began meeting just last month is currently open to more participants. Werner added that women from the Asian American communities are encouraged to join.


""Women who come here from Asian countries and who have been here a while, get involved with men and their traditional roles broaden,"" explains Werner. She said many of the Asian women end up, working and adopting American ways, and this results in ""getting caught up in different cultural expectations."" Werner said these strains affect relationships.


For more information on the Women Who Love Too Much support group that's held at the San Mateo County Center, 191, School Street in Daly City call Werner at (415) 756-3877.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Marc Chow, an eighth grade honor student at Saint Brendan's School, placed first in the biology section of the seventh annual San Francisco Science Fair held earlier this month at Joseph Randall Museum.


Twenty-five parochial and public schools participated in the competition sponsored by the S.F. Unified School District, Recreation and Parks Department and the Archdiocese of San Francisco.


The 13-year-old's blue ribbon science project titled, ""Beans, Water and Wine"" advanced to the San Francisco Bay Area Science Fair held at the California Academy of Science in San Francisco.


""I was really excited and happy that I won first place. Last year I did a project too and I got an honorable mention, but this time I got first!""


Marc said he got his idea to test the plants using wine during the evening mealtime he shares with his parents Dr. and Mrs. Edward A. Chow. Dr. Chow is an internist and current president of the California Society of Internal Medicine.


""During dinner time they drink a glass of wine sometimes, so I wondered if it would be good for plants and if it would promote growth.""


Marc said he decided to conduct an experiment by placing six kidney beans in four pots. He nourished each pot with a different substance. He explained that three of the bean pots were periodically given white, red or rose wine while one of the pots full of beans was given water.


After a short period of time the results became evident, and Marc was able to make some important conclusions from his experiment.


""The one I gave water to grew well"" said Marc. ""I found that none of the ones with wine promoted growth. They came out bad, smelled and grew mold.""


And what does Marc think about alcohol for human consumption?


""I think wine is OK for humans once in a while, but they shouldn't have too much. And it is not good for plants!""

Attention Moms and Dads of Chinese American teenagers!


Dr. Evelyn Lee, professor of psychiatry at the University of California in San Francisco, has just added another most important item to her menu on how to raise these teens:


""The parents have to take care of themselves, find internal peace and understand the concept of change,"" said Lee, who practices Buddhism and seeks the middle path.


After you've mastered that principle, buy Dr. Lee's book, Ten Principles on Raising Chinese American Teens, and get busy with the other 10, which offer sound and specific advice to Chinese immigrant parents with kids growing up in American culture. (See Asian Week, 11/11/88.)


In her easy-to-read self-help book, Lee combines especially ethnic problems -- such as triple generation gaps, cultural gaps and survival stress -- with American psychology. Her 10 principles on raising the little darlings are as follows:


1) Understand your teenager's physical and psychological needs.


Lee wants to remind parents that a teen's longing for independence and self-reliance is quite normal and is not indicative of rebellious behavior.


""Some Chinese parents treat their kids like adolescents until they marry, and that could be at 35 years of age,"" said Lee.


Lee encourages parents to alleviate stress about their children's physiological changes by teaching their children about sex.


""If the parents refuse to discuss sex, the lucky ones get educated about it at school, and the unlucky ones receive their education from the media, especially television,"" said Lee.


2) Improve communication.


According to Lee, a lot of parents and teenagers practice negative communication, not really taking the time to talk to each other and instead yelling at each other.


""Television gives a family a false sense of security. They feel like they're all together, but communication doesn't exist,"" said Lee.


Often parents of Chinese American teens experience language problems with their children.


""Often the kids are more comfortable with English than they are with Chinese. They can get by with 'kitchen Chinese' but aren't comfortable enough to express their feelings with it. And often parents make no attempt to learn English,"" said Lee.


3) Use appropriate rewards and discipline.


Lee's book encourages parents to compliment their children and not just criticize them.


""Meanwhile the kids are watching the Bill Crosby Show and wondering why their families aren't like that.""


4) Encourage initiative and independence.


Lee recommends that parents allow their children to make decisions for themselves and praise them for it. And she emphasizes the kids' need for privacy.


5) Provide guidance in your teen's social life.


""Chinese parents need guidance in recognizing substance abuse symptoms. Americans can read about it easily enough, but it's more difficult for Chinese-speaking parents. But while parents should be on the alert if their kids start to get into trouble, they should also remain open to their children's involvement in American culture -- after all we don't live in China anymore.""


6) Encourage extracurricular activities.


Often because of Chinese parents' lack of understanding about American culture, they refuse to allow their kids to participate in activities, frequently making them stay at home and study.


""While the value we place on education is a very good aspect of our culture, we are finding that Chinese Americans have barriers in their careers, because their communications skills are believed to be deficient. We need to try and make our kids more well-rounded to compete in the American job market.""


7) Know your teenager's school environment.


""Parents can request a translator to help with communications between themselves and their kids' teachers; such conferences are an important part of the American school system. Parents will feel more in control the more they know about their kids' schools.""


8) Develop a positive cultural identity.


""This is very impertant for Chinese American teens, establishing a positve identity. We need more tools to work with. I often use a tape used by Jewish community centers when I work with Chinese American teens. One section is devoted to self-hate; we need to overcome our insecurites and feel confident about out race. Usually there isn't a dry eye in the room after viewing this particular tape.


""I think family groups are great where the children can listen to listen to their parents discuss the life they fled from and their experiences, and parents can learn a lot about this country by listening to their children.""


9) Maintain family harmony.


""Frequently teens in trouble come from homes with troubles. Quite often a correlation exists between substance abuse with the kids and gambling with the parents. How can children respect their parents' wishes if they see them breaking the rules too?""


10) Utilize community resources.


""A lot of immigrant families don't have a concept of seeking counseling, because it just doesn't exist where they come from. And traditionally we like to keep many secrets and pretend that everything is just fine -- and it's not. Becoming part of a group can be very helpful, finding other people to talk to with similiar problems. And the kids are usually really relieved to find someone to talk with who can understand their problems. Cultural transitions are tough on the kids too, especially during adolescence.""

OAKLAND -- The Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations has been awarded a $143,428 grant from the Centers for Disease Control for a ""National AIDS Minority Information and Education Program.""


The project focuses on AIDS education training for staff at each of the six AAPCHO centers and development of a video in various Asian Pacific languages targeted at immigrants and refugees, the primary client base of each AAPCHO center.


Because of the high numbers of non-literate individuals within the Asian Pacific community, audiovisual resources are highly important in prevention efforts. The majority of the clients and community members served by the AAPCHO clinics do not benefit by information disseminated through the English media or the current English AIDS literature available today.


The Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations is a national network of community health centers that serve the Asian Pacific population.


Member centers include Asian Health Services in Oakland, North East Medical Services in San Francisco, Chinatown Health Clinic in New York, International District Community Health Center in Seattle, Kokua Kalihi Valley in Honolulu and South Cove Community Health Center in Boston.

SAN FRANCISCO -- George Coate's performance work, ""Actual Sho,"" begins with the protagonist dying by choking on a chicken bone. From that point of departure, whether he embarks on a journey to the netherworld of the collective subconscious or to another destination is up for debate, but the dreamlike odessy that ensues is a piece of heaven for its viewing audience.


Coates, the Bay Area's own, has emerged as the sine qua non maestro of performance art, combining music, dance and theater into both a visually and auditorily breathtaking experience. Beyond a doubt, ""Actual Sho"" falls into this category.


If anyone ever wished that new life could be breathed into musical theater, the collaboration of George Coates and composer Marc Ream does just that with wordless arias, gospel and new wave vocal scores, as divas Marlynn Smith, Molly Holm and Nepata Mero move in and out of scenic projections, by Charles Rose, that create visual awe as the music delights and seduces the soul, leaving one fervently desiring a recording of the exquisite post-verbal vocals.


Actor Sean Kilcoyne, who studied at the prestigious Polish Theater Lab in Paris, portrays modern man on a quest with the only speaking role, in which he discusses a Tibetan Book of Poultry and the composition of the chemically produced birds.


He first addresses the audience while strapped to a guerney upside down, dies from eating chicken at a wedding reception, having previously stated, ""if I eat chicken again, I'll just die,"" and reappears (post-monum) equipped with a backpack, a construction helmet, and a metal detector.


He's on a quest. For what, is hard to say, but ""Actual Sho"" is an adventure for all.


Did Coates intend to accentuate man's struggle, barriers, or captivity, with the human voice as the only tenuous thread that links men with one another, words in and of themselves carrying only one layer of meaning, with the force behind them defining the situation?


After dying, Kilcoyne emerges from a tunnel as does a bride figure at the end of the performance. Are we intended to interpret the tunnel with its undoubtedly existential overtones and apply that philosophy to the work itself?


Well, one never knows for sure, and it scarcely matters, since it's brillant however one decides to add it up to his own logical conclusions or inconclusions. But a continuous, coherent narrative is not the framework of what Coates himself describes as: ""an interplay of archetypes of power, personal, psychological and spiritual.""


The projections themselves, created by translucent screens and a multitude of projectors, echo illusion after illusion, which one can look at on as many levels as one may choose, while the images remind one that man is submerged in a technically sophisticated world.


According to Coates, ""Sho is a Japanese word of many meanings. Evaporating after-shadow is one. Flight is another.""


Mime and movement artist Hitomi Ikuma gives flight to a stunning wushu dance performance, with strong martial arts movements coming forth from beneath a long gown. Ikuma, who has performed in Coates' previous works, ""Rarearea,"" ""The How Trilogy"" and ""Seehear,"" cuts an androgynous figure with remarkable grace, energy and precision in her performance.


Barbara Imhoff on harp, David Frazier on percussion and Larry Schneider on saxophones take their places on stage right and left and are part of the cast, all of whom deserve kudos for the ""sho.""


Selling out performances in Stuttgart, Belgrade and Wroclaw, Poland, and receiving rave reviews in New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago, ""Actual Sho"" is back in San Francisco for the second time, playing at the Herbst Theater through Jan. 8. If you're looking for a holiday treat, this should be at the top of your list.

The IRS is auditing dozens of clients of a Garden City, Kansas Vietnamese American tax preparer for listing their relatives in Vietnam as dependents.


The 2,000-member strong Vietnamese community in the city say some have had to pay as much as $4,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties. They are gathering signatures on a petition protesting the tax law and its unfairness to Vietnamese refugees, which will be sent to the president and the Kansas congressional delegation.


""These tax laws became an issue in the Bay Area a few years ago. The issue becomes murky when you try to draw a line between the legitimacy and the legality of the matter. But we never got as far as trying to have the laws changed. That would be a cause for us to take up,"" said Vu-Duc Vuong of the Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement Center in San Francisco.


Under certain circumstances the tax law allows refugees to claim only their wives or husbands in Vietnam as dependents.


""Refugees aren't allowed to claim their children, if they are still in Vietnam -- only the husband or wife, whichever the case may be,"" said Tram Pham, a tax preparer in the San Jose area.


And not only do tax laws govern the kind of dependents that a refugee can claim, but another law governs the amount of money that can be sent to Vietnam.


""It's illegal to send more than $2000 per year to Vietnam,"" said Nguyen Nguyen, director of the Mutual Assistance Association, a council serving Southeast Asian refugees in the Bay Area.

SACRAMENTO -- Over 200 friends celebrated the 80th birthday of Wayne Yim Tom at the Rice Bowl Restaurant on Wednesday, June 22. Tom was the original bandleader of the only Chinese traveling vaudeville band in the 1930's, the Musical Mandarins.


After retiring from the entertainment business, Tom became a candy and tobacco distributor in Sacramento. Now a prominent Chinese community leader, Tom serves as one of the main forces behind both the Sacramento Chinese Grocers Association and the Sacramento Chinese Golf Club.


In the 1970's, he broke procedent twice by becoming the first Asian elected president of the National Tobacco Association and by being one of the first Chinese Americans to visit the People's Republic of China, only four months after President Nixon made his initial visit in 1972.


Highlights of the birthday party, which was hosted by his children, Joyce Yee, Kenneth Tom and Ronald Tom, included a resolution from the California State Legislature and a resolution presented by City Councilman Tom Chinn.


David Sum of Oakland, California, one of the original members of the Musical Mandarins, proved that he has not lost his touch as he treated the audience to piano styling of jazz and standard tunes of yesteryear.

Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is challenging Sen. Pete Wilson, boasts strong support for the Asian Pacific American community and its political aims.


He opposes the Kennedy-Simpson immigration bill, which could reduce visas for Asians' relatives and create a new category that would favor fluency in English.


McCarthy opposes any quota system that creates an artificial ceiling on admission rates for Asian Pacific students or any other minority.


McCarthy opposes the U.S. English proposal for a constitutional amendment to establish English as the official language. He supports the ""English-Plus"" movement to take steps to finance English proficiency programs.


As a longtime advocate of closer economic ties with the Pacific Rim nations, he believes the U.S. should reduce the trade deficit by expanding exports not reducing imports.


McCarthy says he has worked hard to reduce racially motivated violence and supports the hate crime statistics bill, which calls for more accurate record-keeping.


A supporter of ""A World of Difference,"" an anti-prejudice program for the public schools, he believes in bringing the program to every major population center across California, helping a multiracial, multi-religious and multi-ethnic state live up to its highest ideal.

CARSON -- Thousands of Samoans from throughout greater Los Angeles gathered recently for the first annual Flag Day Celebration. The four-day event at Victoria Regional County Park began with a number of traditional ceremonies and the honoring of Samoan Gov. A.P. Lutali and Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Gardena).


Lutali and Floyd were offered a number of items including the rare ava root, which is reserved for important occasions and is a sign of great respect. The ava root is found only in Samoa.


The ceremony was overseen by Samoan chiefs dressed in traditional clothing. Representatives of various elected officials were present.


The gathering celebrates the independence of Western Samoa from New Zealand in 1961 and the 88-year relationship between American Samoa and the United States.


The festival was an opportunity for Samoans living here to come together and celebrate their culture. It was also an opportunity to share it with the larger community.


The smell of Polynesian food and the sounds of Samoan music filled the air as people gathered together to visit with friends, eat and participated in numerous games, including cricket, softball, basketball and volleyball. The festival also featured pie-eating, banana-paring and coconut-grating contests as well as tug-of-wars.


""We are a living culture,"" explained June Pouesi, program coordinator for the Office of Samoan Affairs. ""We still have our language and culture, and family ties are important to us. This festival stresses that.""


Sixty thousand Samoans live in the United States. Two-thirds live in Southern California; 12,000 live in Carson alone.


As the assemblyman for the Carson area Floyd has worked extensively with the Asian Pacific community. Floyd has joined the fight for a fair counting of Asian Pacifics in the 1990 Census and for breaking down the Asian Pacific populations by individual ethnic group. This will allow for a better assessment of the needs of the various communities and is particularly important to smaller ethnic groups like Samoans.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The location of the ""lost"" Chinese fishing village -- discovery of which was trumpeted on the front pages of local newspapers last week -- has been known to historians for over a century.


Artifacts from the village have been displayed at a nearby housing development for a year.


""The village was never lost,"" said archaelogist Allen Pastron who completed an 18-month excavation of the site this month. ""There were a number of people interested in San Francisco history who knew it was there.""


Nor is it the site of the oldest Chinese settlement in California, as some media have reported.


""Chinatown itself is older,"" noted Pastron.


The village, established in 1851 or 1852, is important because it may be the oldest fishing settlement of any kind in the state (""the Indians fished but they did not have fishing villages per se""), said Pastron.


The site has turned up about 5,000 artifacts from the Chinese village and an additional 20,000-25,000 from subsequent settlements.


Most of the Chinese artifacts are refuse cast out in the 10-15 years that Chinese inhabited the site. But they include well-presented bowls, cups, candlesticks, an opium pipe and other implements.


Among the most interesting are three carefully carved wooden sampan-style boats, each about eight inches long and three inches across, apparently used as models to build fishing boats.


Historians theorize that Chinese miners who were driven from the Sierra Nevada by whites returned to the profession they had left in China when starting the fishing village.


Many were later employed by a white businessman on Rincon Point, which later became a fashionable residential area before returning to light industry around the turn of the century.


Forest City Enterprises and General Atlantic Development Corp., the two developers who have teamed up to build the Bayside Village apartment complex on the site, hope to ""rejuvenate"" the South Beach neighborhood.


Studio apartments in the complex rent for $595 a month and fit The City's definition of ""low income housing.""


Developers spent about $100,000 for the archaeological dig in an agreement with The City, but sent their bulldozers right in on the heels of Pastron's team as it left the site.


The actual village stood on Rincon Hill above the new development at Beale and Bryant streets, which was under the San Francisco Bay at the time. The artifacts were con-tained in earth that was transported to the current site from the hill in a 19th century landfill project.


Pastron said the objects he had recovered would be cleaned, analyzed, photographed and eventually put on display in a Bay Area museum. The California Historical Society has expressed interest.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The first all-Topaz, Utah, War Relocation Authority (WRA) camp reunion is scheduled for the weekend of Sept. 16-18. All former residents, employees and administrators of the camp are invited to attend. Headquarters for this gathering is the Burlingame Hyatt Regency Hotel which is located near the San Francisco airport.


Officially called the Central Utah Relocation Center, Topaz, with a population of 8000, was one of 10 detention centers established by the WRA to house some 110,000 . . . Americans who . . . from their homes on the West Coast and interned in concentration camps located in the wastelands of inland United States during World War II. Topaz was in existence from august 1942 until November 1945. Named for the Topaz Mountain nearby, this wartime desert town, bordered by a barbed wire fence, was ironically referred to as the ""jewel of the desert.""


The majority of the persons incarcerated at Topaz were from the San Francisco Bay Area. They were initially-evacuated to the Tanforan and the Santa Anita Assembly Centers in California. Both of these centers were former race tracks where most of the residents resided in horses' stables. In the fall of 1943 a number of evacuees from the Tule Lake Center, located near the California-Oregon border, were transferred to Topaz. These residents were from the Sacramento area, and from Oregon and Washington. In addition a limited number of persons from Hawaii were interned in Topaz.


The evacuation and detention of Japanese Americans was the direct result of wartime hysteria, prejudice, discrimination and the failure of the United States Constitution to protect the civil rights of its citizens, noted a congressional commission.


Co-chairpersons Fumi Manabe Hayashi and Mas Kawaguchi announced, ""This reunion will be the first opportunity for former residents of the Topaz internment camp to get together with old friends and neighbors to reminisce about their lives behind barbed wire during a most shameful period of United States history. Although these internees endured innumerable adversities and suffered the humiliation of detention by a suspicious government, there is a need, or a catharsis, to share these experiences almost a half a century later.""


The roster for the mailing list is incomplete. Former Topazans who wish to receive information about the reunion are requested to send in their own names and addresses, as well as those of family members, neighbors and friends who were at Topaz, to Fumi Hayashi, 1629 Jaynes St., Berkeley, CA 94703, (415) 524-1048.


The committee plans to display an exhibit of photographs, paintings, other artwork and handicrafts, maps, directories, documents, memorabilia, publications, artifacts, etc., created in Topaz. Former residents or their descendants who are willing to lend or donate these items are asked to contact Hayashi or Daisy Uyeda Satoda, 109 Gladeview Way, San Francisco 94131 (415) 821-0164. All donated items, including those that may not be appropriate for this particular exhibit, are of great interest and value to researchers of Japanese American history, and will be forwarded after the reunion to one of several Japanese American museums, libraries, or historical societies for permanent safe-keeping.

OAKLAND -- While fire-fighters, lawyers and city officials were meeting to discuss racial incidents in the San Francisco Fire Department, Malcolm X was meeting with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. across the Bay.


The day was Jan 15, 1988, when King would have turned 59 if he had not been struck down by an assassin's bullet 20 years ago. And the setting was ""The Meeting,"" a play at the Oakland Ensemble Theatre about an imaginary encounter between the two giants of the black civil rights movement in the 1960s.


Jeff Stetson's play, receiving its Bay Area Premiere, sharply contrasts the styles of King and X, a Christian and a Moslem, one a leading advocate of nonviolent civil disobedience, the other a militant separatist.


Isiah Whitlock, Jr. portrays King as a man almost serene in his profound, unshakable belief in love as a force for change.


Marcus Naylor makes excellent use of body language to show a tense, awkward Malcolm X, shaken with the nightmares of his violent struggle against oppression.


The play will disappoint anyone with hopes for a far-reaching debate about strategies for social change. Stetson gets at philosophical questions mostly with allegory, and confines the discourse between his two characters to an exchange of criticisms, witticisms and retorts.


For example:


X: ""Still the dreamer.""


King: ""You're still the revolutionary.""


X: ""Thank you""


King: ""I didn't realize I had complimented you.""


X: ""Sometimes ignorance is the greatest compliment.""


King: ""If I didn't know better I'd think you were trying to upset me.""


X: ""Someone who lets people hit him upside the head should not get upset by words.""


Nevertheless the discussion might pique the interest of San Francisco Asian firefighters who, in the words of one of them, ""are neither fish nor fowl.""


They are caught between sympathy for blacks militating against racism and their desire to maintain friendships with the white colleagues with whom they must almost daily trust their lives.


Most Asian firefighters acknowledge getting ""hit upside the head"" with slurs like ""Chinaman."" One is trying to get everyone to talk out their problems. Another has cast his lot with the blacks who brought suit against The City.


But most remain silent, passive, uncommitted.


""The Meeting"" will be performed at the Oakland Ensemble Theatre through Feb. 21 -- the day of Malcolm. X's assassination in 1965.

Dr. Diana Lam is currently San Francisco's only Asian woman cardiologist, and perhaps, the first Asian woman cardiologist to privately practice in The City.


Diana Lam, M.D., has opened the doors of her new medical practice to the Sunset and Richmond districts. She brings new knowledge and technological advances of a rapidly, advancing field. She has chosen one of the most underserved regions of The City.


Proficient in the care of the critically ill, she also enjoys the practice of general internal medicine. ""Prevention,"" Dr. Lam stresses, ""is the key to staying healthy.""


She emphasizes that heart attack is the number one cause of death in this country.


""People with increased risk for coronary artery disease can readily identify themselves. These risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, tobacco use, high blood cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. In many ways it is fortunate that we can personally modify some of these risk factors. For example, controlling one's high blood pressure, stopping tobacco use and altering our diet to lower our cholesterol, are all ways to minimize our chances of having coronary heart disease."" Dr. Lam also warns that ""the symptoms of heart disease can be elusive."" Oftentimes cardiac chest pain may be mistakenly diagnosed as ""indigestion."" Some patients may not experience any symptoms at all. She encourages all patients to always seek medical evaluation regardless of how insignificant their complaint may seem.


Born and raised in San Francisco, she has deep roots here. She is proud of her Chinese heritage. Her father, Howard, was a young immigrant from Canton, China. Her mother was a young native San Franciscan. They exemplified the persevering patience, the self-motivation and the unshakable confidence in the face of struggle, of that generation of Chinese in America.


Diana calls her mother the true liberated woman of her day. As is typical in Chinese family businesses, her mother Esther, in her youth, worked right alongside her younger brother David Chan and nephew Alvin Yick. Through their arduous efforts, the business soon grew and prospered. The Lincoln Shrimp Company, now located on Commerical Street, was founded by Diana's grandfather.


After graduating from Lowell High School, Lam attended UC Berkeley. The Berkeley experience during the post-Vietnam era was one of political and academic enrichment and personal growth. As a college student, Diana was also energetically involved with the Asian Health Clinic in San Francisco's Chinatown. This was a free clinic run by dedicated UC Berkeley students. She and others also taught a course in the Asian Studies Department. The class was an analysis of some of the flaws in the American health care system, emphasizing the inaccessibility of medical care to the poor.


After graduation from Berkeley she entered UC San Diego's School of Medicine. ""At that time women were just beginning to gain increasing acceptance in medical school,"" she recalls. Her class was comprised of only 10 percent women students.


She took her training in Internal Medicine at UC Davis Sacramento Medical Center. She fondly remembers, ""My professor were great teachers and exemplary physicians."" Diana herself enjoyed teaching young medical students. ""Teaching, is the art of simplifying complex concepts and making them easy to grasp,"" she says.


During her final year at Davis she was honored with the ""Outstanding Resident Teaching Award"" which marked a memorable conclusion of her three years at UCDMC.


Completing the residency program, Diana practiced internal medicine for two years. ""During that period,"" she recalls, I learned about the humanistic aspects of medicine, a side that is oftened overlooked in medical school. While in medical training we are often too busy or too afraid to become emotionally involved with the patient or the patient's family.""


Subsequently she took her training in the subspecialty of cardiovascular medicine at San Francisco General Hospital. She completed her fellowship in June of 1987, and has continued to participate in medical research there.


Dr. Lam's new medical office, located at 2350 Irving Street, is in the heart of a burgeoning Chinese population. ""There is an unspoken kinship amongst all Chinese because of our common language and culture."" She is bilingual, fluent in Cantonese and even speaks some Mandarin. She believes, therefore, that she can serve the immigrant Chinese patient, the elderly, the young, the English-speaking alike, all with equal effectiveness.


Dedicated to her work and practice, Dr. Lam will greatly impact upon the medical needs of this community.

The Asian American campaign dollar has demonstrated its power. Now the Asian American vote must come of age.


A Southern California researchers told a USA Today reporter that Asians would contribute as much as $15 million to presidential candidates this year.


The Asian community has shown its strength in securing a promise that President-elect George Bush will actively seek out qualified Asian American candidates for appointment to high office.


This goal was adopted by almost a national consensus among Asian Americans as a way to raise their visibility as full participants in the American mainstream. By bringing Asian faces before the American public as prominent players in the president's administration, the community hopes to overcome the perception that Asian Americans are somehow foreign or deserve blame for domestic economic woes. There will be fewer cases of racial violence such as the killing of Vincent Chin; the ""glass ceiling"" which blocks advancement of Asians will be shattered.


But now the community must look forward to the next important step. It was able to command the attention of Bush and Dukakis because of the substantial contributions Asian Americans made to the campaigns, but political leaders tend to ""take the money and run"" when there are votes to be captured elsewhere.


All too often Asian Americans have contributed generously to political leaders but received little more than autographed photos and framed proclamations in return. Meanwhile other groups which contribute less but turn out large numbers of voters get money for health care, housing, education and job training, plus government contracts for businesses in their communities which in turn create more jobs.


Large campaign contributions do their part in capturing politicians' attention. Large numbers of registered voters will keep their attention focused on the needs and aspirations of the community.


Patrick Andersen is managing editor of Asian Week.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The City moved last week to force major arts institutions to include Asians, and other minorities in their management.


The Board of Supervisors' Human Services Committee last Thursday ordered formation of a task force to sift through data indicating that few minorities are in top positions among San Francisco's biggest and best financed art institutions.


The heavily attended committee meeting, which lasted late into the evening, was spurred by consultant and fundraiser Jeff Jones' report, ""San Francisco's Prominent Arts Organizations: Why Aren't They Equal Opportunity Employers' which covers 130 arts groups financed by The City.


As reported by Asian Week April 15, 80.7 percent of The City's hotel tax fund available to the arts went to the seven largest, non-profit cultural organizations last year. And last year San Francisco distributed $13.8 million to support local art, theater, music and dance companies.


The seven include the Fine Arts Museums, San Francisco Ballet, San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Symphony, Museum of Modern Art, American Conservatory Theatre and the Exploratorium.


According to Jones, only 12 percent of the large arts organizations are represented by minority employees and a mere five percent are represented by Asians. Jones said he wants to see these organizations integrate their boards of directors, their staff, performers and audiences.


The seven include the Fine Arts Museum, San Francisco Ballet, San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Symphony, Museum of Modern Art, American Conservatory Theatre and the Exploratorium.


""The report shows gaps. There are blatant shortcomings that need to be overcome,"" said Supervisor Jim Gonzales, who expressed interest in authoring legislation that would require funding recipients to have affirmative action goals.


""The City is underfunded for the multicultural communities and there needs to be a commitment to recruit minority, pools. I want everyone to have a better chance when they interview for a job,"" said Gonzales.


Some two dozen representavies of both large and small minority San Francisco arts organizations lined up to give testimony at the hearing.


Arnold Townsend, a black programer at radio station KPOO, criticized the members of the large organizations that went before him for not directly addressing why few minorities are represented in their organizations. Townsend also lashed out at the supervisors for insisting at the opening of public testiminy that the representatives of the majors go first, saying that this was an example of special status.


""I think it is an insult to have to beg and plead and to take tax monies and not hire minorities. That's theft. If it's said that there are no minorities that are qualified, that they can not be found, then the person who is looking is not qualified to be looking.""


Helen Bautista, an Asian American working with City Connection also stressed a need for more minorities on the boards and staffs of the arts organizations. She emphasized that San Francisco is not just ""black and white.""


""There are other colors here too -- Japanese Chinese, Cambodian, Indian, Samoan,"" said Bautista. ""Half of The City consists of Pacific Rim people This should be looked at when you decide on funding.""


The task force to be formed will include two representatives from the seven major art institutions in San Francisco and a representaive each from 11 multicultural organizations, who will work with S.F. Chief Administrative Officer Rudy Nothenberg, who oversees arts financing.


Nothenberg said that the programs under his jurisdiction are required to follow The City's affirmative action plan. He recently met with 50 of art groups to demand they follow affirmative action plans.

Federal legislation which will compensate Americans of Japanese ancestry interned during World War II was passed in the House of Representatives on Thursday and will be sent to President Reagan where he will sign the measure into law.


House debate necessary for the bill's final approval began late on Wednesday and, according a Washington source Asian Week spoke to on Wednesday, redress supporters overcame a last-minute effort by Rep, Daniel Lungren to block the measure. Thursday morning Congress concluded the debate and voted 257 to 156 in favor of the bill.


The bill calls for payments of $20,000 to each surviving internee and an official apology for the United States government's incarceration of some 120,000 Japanese Americans in 1942. A $50 million trust fund for educational projects on internment and other provisions will also be established.


Reagan indicated on Monday he supported the measure in a letter sent to Speaker of the House James Wright. In the letter Reagan stated that he welcomed the bill and urged the House to ""act swiftly and favorably on the bill.""


Reagan said he is ""particularly pleased that the bill provides for a measured disbursement of the amount authorized for the trust fund and ensures that acceptance of compensation under the legislation fully satisfies claims against the United States based on the unique circumstances.""


He added that the enactment of the redress bill ""will close a sad chapter in American history in a way that reaffirms America's commitment to the preservation of liberty and justice for all.""


News that Reagan sent the letter of support to Wright moved swiftly through Washington and Japanese American communities around the nation. The endorsement smoothed over doubts that the bill would be vetoed since Reagan had not taken a stand publicly on the measure until Monday.


In recent months sources in Washington indicated that Reagan would probably sign the bill, but it didn't always look promising. Last September, when the bill was up for a critical vote on the House floor, the Office of Management and Budget issued a statement of administration policy saying the ""president's senior advisors will recommend that the president veto the bill should it be presented to him.""


But through the efforts of legislators, the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations, Japanese American Citizens League and a strong grassroots campaign, the appeal for redress and reparations was spread coast to coast.


Rep. Robert Matsui, a key legislator in the redress movement, was elated to hear of the good news upon receipt of the letter.


""This is what we've worked for more than a decade to achieve,"" said Matsui. ""Our president has told Congress that he will ensure justice is served in this sensitive matter that has affected the lives of 120,000 Americans. The president deserves a salute. In time today's letter will become a very historic document.""


Rep. Norman Mineta, who was interned as a boy, was equally delighted upon hearing that Reagan urged the House to approve H.R. 442. He also acknowledged the thousands who have contributed to the advancement of the bill. Since the 1970s dozens of organizations from across the nation joined the movement.


""The glorious victory is the result of the dreams and struggles of thousands of people concerned about justice. Now finally we can say that personal justice will be achieved."" said Mineta.


An official signing ceremony for the redress bill is likely to take place once the president has it in his possesion, according to a White House aide Asian Week contacted Tuesday. Celebrations are expected to take place throughout the United States. Locally a celebration will take place at the Japanese American Citizens League on the evening the bill is signed.

LOS ANGELES -- Marching to the beat of Japanese drums on Monday afternoon, over 100 people protested the Japanese government's policy of fingerprinting non-Japanese citizens living in Japan.


Men and women in business suits took time off from their lunch breaks and joined the protesters, some who were garbed in native dress, to march in front of the Japanese Consulate in Little Tokyo to show their disapproval of the Japanese policy.


In Japan, Koreans and other non-Japanese are fingerprinted and required to carry passbooks.


The passbooks, smaller than a United States passport, have become heavy burdens of discrimination, according to a delgation of Koreans, Chinese and an American living in Japan.


Pak Yong Bok, one of the principal members of the delegation, burned his own passbook after an impassioned plea for justice during the hour-long protest.


Members of the delegation met with two representatives of the consulate before the protest began. Rev. Dr. Grant Hagiya read a resolution that was unanimously adopted at a community meeting attended by leaders from Asian American communites. The meeting was sponsored by local groups and individuals including the American Friends Service Committee, the Japanese American Bar Association, the Korean American Association, the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations, Stewart Kwoh, Linda Wong and Rev. Phil Zwerling.


After citing the history of the fingerprinting law and its effect, the resolution states that ""members of Korean American, Japanese American, and greater Los Angeles communities call upon the Japanese government to end racism and forced assimilation of minority people; ...that the Japanese government stop harassment of Ron Fujiyoshi and other fingerprint refusers....""


The Japanese officials present at the reading appeared sympathetic but were unable to officially comment without an interpreter. They did agree to present the resolution to the Consul General of Japan, and to elicit a formal response.


Ron Fujiyoshi, the Los Angeles-born American member of the delegation and a fingerprint refuser, stated that there was a revision of the fingerprinting law after some protests against it, but it ""is not a real revision... it still keeps the fingerprinting. It increases the control, not improves the conditions.""


Fujiyoshi feels that a strong show of support from Los Angeles during the protest will spark more support for their cause throughout the United States. He is a lay missionary in Osaka, home of the highest concentration of Koreans living in Japan. Fujiyoshi appealed to the Osaka High Court of Appeals about the fingerprinting laws, and the case will be heard on May 17.


One Japanese Korean protester, Hoon Sook Kim said the delegates came to the U.S. because they wanted the people of America to know about the apartheid-like conditions in Japan for minorities. Kim hopes the U.S. will put pressure on the Japanese government to discontinue the discriminatory practices.


A representative of the American Indians, Ernie Peters Longfellow mentioned the struggle of the American Indians for equality in the United States, and said, ""I can say we're behind you 100 percent, and you can count on us for support."" Other prominent protesters included Yoon Hee Kim, president of the Korean American Coalition and John Saito, president of the Japanese American Citizens League.


The delegation in addition to Pak and Fujiyoshi, also consists of five fingerprint refusers, a paraplegic and a junior high school student. All of the 16 delegates are grassroots organizers involved in various human rights struggles, The delegation's tour will continue throughout the United States.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The 43rd annual state convention of American Veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam (AMVETS) will be held at the Hilton Inn in Sacramento on June 24, 25 and 26 with delegates from all over the state.


In view of the cuts in many federal programs, the organization will bear the heavy burden to find ways and means to solve the multiple complex problems which are daily facing veterans, especially those who were disabled when fighting America's wars on land, at sea and in the air.


Northern Area Commander James G. Jay will lead the delegation of the posts from Northern California area to the convention. Elected delegates of San Francisco's Golden Gate Post No. 34 are Commander Mack Pong, John L. Lock, Woodrow W. Chan and John T. A. E. Wark.

Asian actors are increasingly adding to the richness of contemporary stage and screen, often in performances in non-ethnic roles.


One can remember locally a Chinese American child as ""Tiny Tim"" in last year's American Conservatory Theater performance of ""A Christmas Carol."" The talented Kelvin Han Yee is slated for an ACT role in the company's forthcoming ""Joan of Arc."" Berkeley Rep has done its part, and the pioneering West End Repertory Theater of Berkeley, under Patricia Leslie's production-direction, started the careers of two fine Japanese American actresses, Diana Tanaka and Sharon Omi. The latter has since become very prominent in the Bay Area scene in non-ethnic roles, most recently as the shepherdess Phoebe in ""As You Like It"" in this year's Shakespeare in the Park.


On screen two prominent names leap to mind. John Lone, who starred in ""The Last Emperor,"" did non-ethnic stints as the ""Ice Man,"" a prehistoric male rejuvenated to 20th-century life, and more recently as an American condom-king and would-be art aficionado. Ben Kingsley, the half-british, half-Indian actor, took an Oscar for playing ""Gandhi,"" but has also portrayed a host of other characters, including the Russian composer Shostakovich. In a forthcoming picture he will appear as Lenin.


Roshan Seth, born in Patna, India, is known to international film audiences for his portrayal of Pandit Nehru, India's first prime minister, in the prize-winning film, ""Gandhi."" He also portrayed the lawyer Amritrao in ""A Passage to India"" and most recently ""Papa"" in the successful comedy-drama of Pakistani life in London, ""My Beautiful Launderette.""


His latest role is that of the rent collector Pancks in ""Little Dorrit,"" the six-hour mini-epic of corruption in early 19th-century London -- an idiosyncratic character of considerable wit, humanity, sense of justice, irony and greed who inadvertently precipitates the hero's downfall.


Seth was the eldest of four sons of a professional couple. He took a master's degree in history at the University of Delhi, and in 1964 moved to Britain to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Then he played in repertory theater all over England, 1969-72.


In that year he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company's world tour of Peter Brooks' ""Midsummer Night's Dream,"" and then appeared in his first feature film, ""Juggernaut."" In 1977 he returned to India to become the editor of the India International Centre Quarterly.


He had decided to remain in India, but was there cast as Nehru by Sir Richard Attenborough for ""Gandhi."" This led to Seth's portraying the celebrated Indian writer, Victor Mehta, in the play ""A Map of the World,"" commissioned for the Adelaide, Australia Festival, brought to London in 1983 and to New York in 1985.


Seth is not the only Asian connected with ""Little Dorrit."" Su Lim and Chin Tye appear in the credits under ""Production.""


And ""Dorrit's"" hero, Arthur Clennam, portrayed by another brilliant actor, Derek Jacobi (memorable for his marvelous enacting of the title role in TV's ""I Claudius""), is a lonely man who has returned to England in his middle age after 20 years in China. But it was a country he never really knew. Tied to a family business by his father, Clennam never left Canton, nor learned anything of the rich empire in which he dwelt. His had been a life of discipline with ""nothing of grace,"" as the child of a loveless marriage.


A Magnificent Film


""Little Dorrit"" I have characterized as a mini-epic. I use this term for its six-hour presentation of a total society with settings which range from ""the Circumlocution Office,"" a government department which handles (or rather mishandles) patents, destroying aspiring inventors in a sea of read tape; to Bleeding Heart Yard, where the poor and unemployed are persecuted by a greedy landlord; the Marshalsea prison, where debtors spend years of their lives, and in which Little Dorrit is born; the Meagles' house in the country, the only locale in which sunlight and greenery enter the picture; and the luxurious dining room, all gold plate and an overflowing board of gourmet treats and fine wines, in which a cold-hearted high society takes its pleasure. All this is a microcosm of a world, done by a masterly production team. Art direction, costumes, scenery are superb.


The more the miracle that ""Little Dorrit"" was shot in ""a small, self-sufficient studio in London's dockland,"" done with front-projected slides of the miniature sets ""bringing the skylines of 1820s Victorian London to life on screen.""


There is virtually no sky in ""Little Dorrit,"" a tremendously claustrophobic picture. Its first scenes, in its hero's family home, occur in almost total darkness, in a house in which his invalid mother has not left her room in 15 years, where she spends her time reading the fire-and-brimstone sections of the Bible and running a business long distance. The Marshalsea prison has its own narrow streets, and its gates are locked at night, visitors there or no, as our hero discovers. Other scenes are equally unspacious, a result in part of a production which cost the low price (for today) of one million British pounds, but which adds immeasurably to the feeling of a locked-in society in which good people are inexorably trapped by the machinery: of a developing greedy capitalism in all its manifestations, including slums, prisons and the horror of government bureaucracy.


Regrettably I've never read Little Dorrit. I always assumed it was another sentimental minor Dickens piece. Instead, it surely bears more relation to the writer's monumental Bleak House, in which the bureaucracy of the Law destroys human lives as surely as the ""Circumlocution Office"" does here.


""Little Dorrit"" has the characteristic Dickens characters: hero, heroine, villains, grotesques, comics -- but under director Christine Edzard's immensely competent hands they become fully three-dimensional, and she handles her first-rate cast brilliantly.


Derek Jacobi, another magnificently versatile English actor, is sympathetic and moving as the hero, a weak but kindly man, raised without love and unable to cope with it when he finally encounters it. A newcomer, Sarah Pickering, is a marvelous ""Little Dorrit,"" who is certainly not a characteristic Dickens ingenue, but a remarkably strong and compassionate young woman, a feminist for her time. The children who portray her growing up have something of the same strength. Alec Guinness portrays her father, who is also ""the Father of the Marshalsea,"" a long-time prison inhabitant, a weak, charming, manipulative man whose self-deceptiveness is marvelously played. Veteran Cyril Cusack gives a sympathetic performance as his brother. On the distaff side, there is the late Joan Greenwood, once a charming beauty, now grown old, with only her wonderful purr-y voice to make her recognizable, full of icy hate as the presumed mother of the hero. There is Amelda Brown, absolutely great as Little Dorrit's selfish older sister, satirically drawn. There are Miriam Margolyes, wonderfully funny as Jacobi's love of his youth, who's grown fat and garrulous; Eleanor Bron as the rich-businessman's wife, looking elegant and Italianate, and prating of noble savages; Sophie Ward as the beautiful Minnie Meagles, whom Jacobi loves but lets go gutlessly; and Janice Cramer, glimpsed briefly and beautifully as Jacobi's youthful love in her youth. And a host of walking caricatures, coming alive, in many, many parts. Among this host of talent, Roshan Seth holds his own always as the likeable scoundrel Mr. Pancks.


Music for ""Little Dorrit"" is ""by Giuseppe Verdi,"" arranged and conducted by Michel Sanvoisin, and admirably suited both for sardonic and romantic purposes to the content of the picture, for which Edzard adapted the Dickens novel to the screen.


This ""major film in two parts"" (Part I, ""Nobody's Fault"" and Part II, ""Little Dorrit's Story""), each three hours long, the first primarily through Arthur Clennam's (Jacobi) eyes, the latter through Dorrit's, is certainly one of the year's best. It is a natural for Best Foreign Oscar, too and surely more people will see it than ""Salaam, Bombay!""


The two have much in common: the real sense of portrayal of a society; their low budgets; the fact that they are both directed and written by women, who are in both cases making their first theatrical film, and both tightly in control of a remarkable cast and technical crew. They are great triumphs, and the Foreign Oscar should be split down the middle and presented to both of them.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Henry Der, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, voiced vehement opposition to the U.S. Census Bureau's plan to use the ""New Short Race"" question for the 1990 Census in a recent letter sent to Congressman Robert Matsui.


Asian Americans throughout the country have protested the bureau's plan to use a shorter form on the question of ethnicity.


Der stated CAA objects to the bureau's plan to not give separate counts of the different Asian and Pacific Islander groups on the 1990 form. The bureau's decision will handicap the Asian American community in obtaining important socio-economic data used for the next decade.


In addition, he said, CAA does hot support the bureau's argument that the new form will generate a greater response rate from those who receive the form.


""We believe that the assertions that Asians will not have any problems with the short form is wrong,"" Der told Asian Week.


Citing the minutes from a special meeting on the 1990 United States Census held last year by the bureau, Der indicated that some Chinese and Filipino short form respondents experienced difficulties completing them. The minutes noted that the bureau officials observed ""that while most people understand, there were some other problems -- language difficulties occurred and respondents wanted more specific ethnic groups to be listed.""


CAA believes the majority of Asian Americans found the 1980 race question, which included six specific Asian racial groups and three Pacific Islander groups, to be adequate and clear.


""The minutes have shown that there were problems with this short form, and people preferred specific listing of groups. There have been assertions that there are no problems with it, but already it shows problems,"" said Der.


He contends that public and private sectors along with Asian American community groups will suffer because specific ethnic demographic information will be unavailable for the next decade as a result of the shortened form. The information is necessary to public agencies, the private sector and community organizations.


""A 100 percent coding of all written responses by Asian American respondents will assist public and private agencies and organizations to target services and programs to meet specific needs on a cost effective and efficient basis,"" said Der.


He indicated that the 1980 Census demonstrated dramatic differences among the nine listed Asian Pacific groups.


Der demonstrated these differences by pointing out that the mean annual earnings for Asian males in the 1980 census ranged from $11,303 for Vietnamese to $21,466 for Japanese.


""There is still a whole hell of a lot of work to be done today, and I recommend that people voice their conoorns to the Census Bureau,"" said Der.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Rev. Jesse Jackson, returning to Chinatown Wednesday night for the first time in four years, challenged Asian Americans to fulfill their dreams.


The presidential candidate came directly from his first California debate with Gov. Michael Dukakis to meet 700 cheering supporters and a half dozen cavorting lion dancers at an Ocean City restaurant banquet.


The fundraiser organized by Asian Americans for, Jesse Jackson, in some ways the climax of Asian support for Jackson's 1988 campaign, raised about $35,000.


His voice hoarse from months of campaigning, Jackson exhorted Asian Americans to ""hold your heads high"" and shatter the barriers of racism.


""What a joy it is to see Asian Americans get involved in campaigns, not just to vote but to manage campaigns; not just to manage campaigns but to run for office,"" he said.


""It's not enough for you just to support me -- I certainly appreciate it -- you must be so free in your spirit to break through any stereotype.


""Not just good in business, not just good in technology but (still) limited to your side of town; you must have the strength and ability to run for Senate, to run for governor, to run for president and expect to win.""


Picking up themes he has sounded frequently in his speeches, Jackson attacked anti-Asian violence and the English only movement.


""My heart is heavy when I think of Vincent Chin"" and other victims of racial violence, Jackson said.


Blaming Asian Americans for the U.S. trade deficit with Asian countries is ""a classic example of escapism,"" he said.


""Asian Americans did not decide to run up this budget deficit. Asian Americans did not run up this debt. Asian Americans did not run up this trade imbalance....


""Asian Americans did not send a cake and a Bible to Ayatolla Khomeini, dealing in hostages for arms....


""Don't be Asian bashing. It's not fair.""


Jackson reminded his audience that half the world is Asian and a quarter African.


""When Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Moscow they will represent one eighth of the world's people,"" he said. ""In the future there will be no summit where seven-eighths of the people are left out....""


""When I become president there will be no more impossible dreams. You keep on dreaming.""


Mabel Teng, who introduced Jackson at the 1984 Democratic National Convention and again when he declared his 1988 candidacy in North Carolina, also presented Jackson to the Ocean City crowd.


""Jesse understands,"" she said. ""Back in '83 when I first told him about Vincent Chin he understood immediately. . . . When Vincent Chin's mother Lily Chin left the country she told me to thank Jesse Jackson for everything he did for her.


Jackson paid tribute to Asians who have played prominent roles in his campaign, including Teng; Mike Murase, his California campaign director; May Louie, his New England campaign director and special assistant; Lyle Butch Wing ""my attorney"" and Northern California field coordinator.


He credited Eddie Wong, his national field coordinator, with ""engineering"" his victories in several state primaries he was expected to lose.


Several other local and Asian supporters preceeded Jackson at the podium, including San Francisco Supervisor Doris Ward, who led the crowd in a chant of ""win, Jesse, win!""; Chung Hoang Chuong, a University of California, Berkeley Asian American studies professor; Rodel Rodis, a newly elected member of the Public Utilities Commission; Ken Lee, a board member of the Korean Community Center of the East Bay; Tsuyako ""Sox"" Kitashima, a member of the National Coaltion for Redress and Reparations; and Frank Chong, an aide to California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.


Representatives of Arabs for Jackson, and Peace Activists for Jackson, and Pat Norman, a leader of local gays and lesbians, also addressed the diners.


Among those who bought tickets for the event were San Francisco Supervisors Richard Hongisto and Willie Kennedy; Henry Der, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action; Keith Choy, executive director of Chinatown Youth Center; Maurice Mitchel of Asian Neighborhood Design; Peggy Saika, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus; Jeffrey Mori of Japanese Community Youth Center; Julie Hatta, of Asian Law Alliance; Dale Shimasaki.

Gadgets have always fascinated me ever since I can remember. For years I've always had a tool collection which would put a lot of guys to shame. I have two electric, saws one a jig-saw and the other a chain saw. A friend gave me my Black and Decker drill when I complained to him that my hand drill wouldn't go through the stucco of my house.


My latest acquisition in the tool department was a chargeable screwdriver. Of course, I have a whole bunch of non-electric screwdrivers, but I just couldn't resist the commercial and found myself in a hardware store buying the item, although I didn't have anything to put screws into at the time.


In my house I have a phone in each bedroom, a phone in the hallway, a phones at the bar in the breakfast nook, and a cordless phone in the dining room. Thanks to the ingenuity of our relatives in Asia, I have quite a collection of ""toys"" with unique features.


The cutest is the Quack phone on the bar. It's a wooden duck and its little red eyes light up when it is in use. It has two buttons which are marked ""redial,"" but I can't get it to perform that function no matter which button I push.


The phone on the wall by the bar is a two-line phone with conference, hold, mute, flash, pause, redial, and speaker features. It can automatically dial up to 28 numbers. I think the phone in my study is the same kind, although I have stored the automatic numbers at different stations, and it sometimes gets confusing.


The phone in the hallway has a 50 foot cord on it so it can travel around with me, however it is a bit clutzy because it has a computer-like keyboard and a memory capacity of around 150 names and phone numbers. This morning I noticed that the little space where the numbers dialed are supposed to print out was pretty faded. Then I checked to see if the memory was still there and found that all the names and numbers after the letter ""G"" were somehow obliterated. Do you realized how long it takes to program in a hundred names and phone numbers? What a drag. When this particular phone is working properly I can scroll to a name and press a button and it dials that person. Or I can key in the first three letters of a name and push one button to dial. It has two lines which conference and hold and also a speaker.


The phone in my bedroom is only a one-line phone with four numbers which can be dialed automatically and 12 numbers which dial automatically after pressing 3 keys. It, too, has a speaker, flash, three redial and mute, but no hold button.


The cordless phone confuses me because sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes the voices come over very clearly, while other times it sounds like I'm on the bottom of the ocean. I thought maybe a new battery would help, and just finding a place which carried the special Ni-Cd battery would almost justify buying a new phone rather than spending all my valuable time searching all over town. This phone has a pager, flash and redial and can convert from pulse to tone. When are you supposed to use pulse?


In my briefcase is a dialer which holds around 200 names and numbers, but the fancy new phone system at my office doesn't work with the dialer. Neither will the new system allow many of the employees to activate their beeperless answering machines. The new system does have memory for 30 speed-dialed numbers. The system has a strange phone mail system, but I liked my simple answering machine better.


With all the automatic dialing, I have memorized almost nobody's phone number. One day I was at my stockbroker's office when she needed my daughters' social security numbers immediately in order to avoid a tax penalty on a transaction. I didn't know either daughter's number. I called my office, and fortunately it was on the bulletin board. The people in the broker's office probably thought I was less than a good mother since I didn't even know how to reach my own children. Embarrassing!


To prevent that from happening again, I now carry in my purse a credit card-size gadget which holds 120 names and numbers which scrolls alphabetically. It also has a calculator, but it doesn't dial when you hold it to the microphone of a telephone.


The bad thing about all these new fangled toys, is that they all operate differently, and reading the operation manuals sometimes nearly requires a degree in electronics. Maybe I'm just not used to the style of English used in Taiwan, Japan or Korea. Some of the manufacturers have special 800 lines where consumers can get repair information if they are willing to wait 45 minutes for a free line. That's when the automatic busy redialer comes in handy.


The odd thing about my having all the clever phones in order to keep in touch with the world out there is that I rarely give anybody my home number, and other than social calls, I really don't enjoy talking on the telephone. It is ironic that most of my livelihood depends on my use of the telephone.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A very non-traditional group celebrated its anniversary with a very traditional-style Chinese banquet here last Friday.


The Chinese Progressive Association, whose name has become synonymous with liberalism and sometimes even radicalism in the past 15 years, has been at the forefront of shaking up the establishment in the Chinese American community and breaking away from the ways of the past.


But when more than 500 people turned out for the CPA's 15th asnniversary dinner at the New Asia Restaurant, they were greeted by all the usual trappings, including lion dancers.


The CPA formed 15 years ago around what was then a very radical concept -- recognition of the People's Republic of China.


Fighting for low-income workers' benefits, promoting equality for Chinese American women, teaching English to new immigrants, organizing tenants of residential hotels -- these and other actions earned the CPA a shaky reputation in conservative Chinatown.


But the huge turnout -- signifying acceptance -- at the traditional banquet -- signifying a mellowing over the years -- came at a time when the CPA is moving toward the mainstream of Democratic politics.


Indeed Mabel Teng, co-founder of the CPA, showed the new direction of the organization during the dinner program as she spoke out against Republican presidential candidate George Bush and even promoted the U.S. Senate candidacy of Democratic Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo of Delaware.


Teng herself symbolizes the emergence of the CPA; she served as one of the chief grassroots deputies for the presidential bid of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and is working closely with the campaign for Michael Dukakis.


But the CPA's roots were not forgotten. Banquet organizers screened a slide show which repeatedly emphasized the plight of the inner-city Chinatown residents -- the elderly, the poverty-stricken, the victims of anti-Asian violence. And the crowd cheered wildly as the narrator blamed these problems on the conservative policies of the Reagan administration.

STANFORD -- While Stanford can take considerable pride in its affirmative action over the past two decades, ""the gap between what we have done and what we aspire to do remains painfully large,"" Provost James Rosse declared in his annual report to the Faculty Senate.


""Just as earlier generations of leadership have emerged from the ranks of Italian Americans, Irish Americans, German Americans, Russian Americans, Polish Americans, Scandinavian Americans, and the many other ethnic groups that have come to make up parts of our pluralistic society, the next generation of leadership will include many drawn from the ranks of black Americans. Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans,"" he declared.


""If Stanford is to sustain the course it has set, it must enroll those students who will be the leaders of the next generation, regardless of ethnic background.


""If we are to enroll those students, we must be prepared to provide them with an education that serves their needs ... An important reason for affirmative action in the recruitment of faculty and academic staff lies in finding those men and women who can teach by the example of their own success in overcoming the handicaps of minority status.""


Undergraduate Admissions


Between 1972 and 1987, the proportion of blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, and Asian Americans among undergraduates doubled, from 15 to 30 percent, the report shows.


The proportion of women among undergraduates has risen from 31 percent in 1968 to 43 percent last year.


Among targeted minorities -- blacks, Chicanos, and Native Americans -- freshman enrollment hit a high water mark of 17.6 percent to 19.1 percent in the years 1982 through 1986. Among those offered admission for next fall, the proportion of targeted minorities has rebounded to 19.8 percent.


During the past five years, the proportion of Asian Americans in the freshman class has risen from 7.3 percent to 16.0 percent, Rosse notes. Applications from Asian Americans have risen by 250 percent during this period.


Overall, Stanford's enrollment of minority students ranked second to Berkeley among fie comparable institutions.


Faculty Affirmative Action


Since the Faculty Affirmative Action Fund was created in 1971-72, the proportion of minorities in the Academic Council has risen from 3.7 percent to 7.7 percent.


During the same period, the proportion of women among the faculty has grown from 5.3 percent to 10.2 percent:


""Growth has been impressive, but the numbers are still small,"" the report notes. The proportion of undergraduate women, blacks, and Hispanics are all four times as large as the proportion of faculty from these groups. For Asians, the proportion of undergraduates is three times that of the faculty.


""One of the important reasons for faculty affirmative action is to develop role models for students,"" Rosse observes. ""We have been less successful in this than one would like.""


While there has been steady progress overall during the past three years, the pattern for each group has been ""mixed and less conclusive.""


During the past three years, the Faculty Affirmative Action Fund contributed more than $450,000 of budget base funding to 16 incremental appointments, Rosse notes.


""Within a strong university like Stanford, the best appointments and promotions decisions are made in a highly decentralized process at the level of peer judgement within schools and department. The FAAF is designed to ensure that those local decisions take into account the importance of affirmative action appointments to the University.""


Graduate Student Trends


Graduate student affirmative action began in 1968 at Stanford, when only 1.6 percent of this groups was black, Chicano, or Native American. By 1973, these targeted minorities totaled 11 percent of graduate students, but ""we have not been able to improve on that figure in the 14 years that have elapsed since then,"" the provost observes.


Both minorities and women are less well represented among master's students than among doctoral students. The fraction of targeted minority students among those earning advanced degrees is somewhat lower than their share of total enrollments, suggesting that their completion rates may be lower than for graduate students generally.


Staff Affirmative Action


""During the past 11 years, total staff employment has risen from about 4700 to nearly 5600 the report notes. Minority representation has risen slowly from less than 22 percent to more than 25 percent, while the proportion of women has grown from 62.4 percent to slightly over 66 percent.


""Women occupy an over-whelming number of clerical support positions and high percentages of the lower and middle exempt classification ranges,"" the report observes. ""Their numbers thin significantly in the middle and senior level positions.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Two civil rights organizations said they had filed discrimination complaints Wednesday against the University of California, San Francisco because of an English-only rule.


Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund said they had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of 10 UCSF employees because of a policy of the university that its employees must not use languages other than English while working.


The EEOC guidelines, based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, state that an employee may be required to speak English only ""when the employer can show that the rule is justified by business necessity.""


The complaint brought confused reaction from university administrators, some of whom denied there was any such policy requiring the use of English while others said the policy only applied to business necessity.


At a press conference Wednesday the two organizations distributed copies of reprimands they said were placed in the personnel files of two employees and a notice of the English-only policy that was posted in the Nutrition and Dietetics Department of the school's medical center.


""It has come to the attention of the department that native languages are being spoken in the work area ..."" the notice, dated May 27, 1987, reads. ""...It is the policy of this Department that English should always be spoken in the work areas ... I remind you to save social conversation in native languages for your breaks and mealtimes or when interpreting for patient interactions.""


An almost identical statement, dated Aug. 21, 1987, was placed in the personnel file of an unidentifed employee, and signed by Joan Hankin, assistant director of nursing, Ambulatory Care Center.


UC employees named in the complaint against UCSF include speakers of Tagalog, Chinese and Spanish.


Two UCSF employees at the press conference testified that they had frequently seen employees told by their supervisors to stop speaking their native languages.


Rene Zamora Baca, who is employed delivering food to patients' rooms, said he had been reprimanded for speaking Spanish to an ""older"" housekeeper whose English is poor. The reprimand came from a Filipino supervisor who herself speaks a Filipino language on the job, he claimed.


Baca charged that supervisors use the policy inconsistently as a form of harassment.


The policy has ""created an atmosphere of oppression and resentment,"" according to Yolanda Cortez, a UCSF diet technician who is a steward for the local Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees.


She said she had heard reports that other hospitals had instituted similar English-only rules.


Inquiries about the policy were at first directed to a university press officer, Bob Sanders, then to university affirmative action officer Michael Adams. Both said that there had never been any policy requiring the use of English and pointed out that the university hires multilingual employees to interpret for non-English-speaking patients.


When reminded of a conversation he had with Mary Higgins, president of the clerical branch of the school's AFSCME local, Adams said that the policy might have been mentioned in passing but that no grievance had been filed.


Cortez said a formal grievance had not been filed because ""we did not feel that the language (in the grievance policy) was strong enough.""


Leon King, the director of the Nutrition and Dietetics Department, said the policy was a business necessity but applied only to ""a life-threatening or safety situation. It has not been enforced in any other type of situation.""


Later Wednesday inquiries to the university were referred to Bill Neff, assistant vice chancellor for labor relations, who said the policy only applied to employees serving food and receiving outpatients.


Requests by the nutrition department to extend the policy to other activities had been specifically denied, he said, and added that the university's administration was investigating to see whether any employees had been disciplined for using a non-English language.


Ed Chen, the ACLU lawyer, called the policy part of the ""pernicious, creeping hysteria that is English-only,"" a movement he said was manifested in a ballot initiative that made English the state's official language in 1986.


In a lawsuit last year the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction against a rule requiring employees of a Los Angeles municipal court to speak English only.


ACLU and MALDEF will vigorously attack such policies wherever they arise, said Chen.

NEW YORK -- Phil Nee is back in the showcase. The 31-year-old Chinese American comedian is once again playing the comedy clubs that don't advertise headliners, in which a continuous stream of funny, almost-funny, and not-so-funny hopefuls play out their routines in search of desperately coveted recognition.


Once again Phil Nee -- veteran of the New York comedy scene, named ""The Funniest Person in America"" by Showtime cable television in 1985 -- is playing the showcases with the confidence of a seasoned performer and the enthusiasm of an as-yet-undiscovered star.


If it seems he's been here before, the difference now is one more of coasts than of clubs. Phil Nee, New York's hippest and funniest Asian American comedian is going to California and neither will come away unchanged.


It's been three years since Nee went to California as part of Showtime's ""funniest Person In America"" tour. In that time he's been fine-tuning his craft, the canny skill of making strangers laugh in public places. His achievements have been many, garnering accolades in clubs and on campuses. He has broadened his skills in advanced acting classes and twice toured Mainland China by by bicycle. Streetwise and sophisticated, Nee has managed to fuse a specific awareness of his self and ethnic heritage with a genuinely organic sense of the funny in all people.


As his skills as a comic generate more successes in the non-Asian audiences to which he most often plays, it is obvious that of his recent sucesses he is most proud of a benefit performance before the Asian American Journalists Association in New York.


""What the AAJA show did for me was it made me feel I didn't have to try that hard -- I don't have to prove that I'm Chinese and funny, just that I'm funny. When I play to a white audience, there's a lot of subtext to what I'm really doing up there -- what kind of pre-conceived stereotyped ideas they have about Asians. When I play in front of an Asian crowd, that doesn't really exist. I'm not fighting that. There's nothing I really have to prove. It's like playing for the home team, even though they've never seen me before."" In going to California, Nee is seeking more than the attention of the faceless Hollywood connection to possible stardom. He is looking for that Asian American audience he has yet to reach -- an audience he knows is out there.


""My goals are, at this time, to feel out the California audience and to establish a base there -- plant some seeds there.""


He is aware that certain adjustments will be required. A key to Phil Nee's success has been his unique perspective as the outsider -- both as an Asian American among the non-Asian New York mainstream, and as a Chinese American from outside the New York Chinatown community.


""Maybe California is a lot more different than New York, because maybe Asians have assimilated into the mainstream culture a lot more easily than they have here. So I may not be quote-unquote, as big a novelty. When I played San Francisco last time, the audience was all white, but they were very receptive. I guess it's because they see so many Chinese all the time, although none of them are comics.


""It will probably take some time for me to change my perspective on who I am when I get out there, because it'll be a little different. My NY perspective will probably change and I have to think of the younger generation, who may not have experienced the discrimination or these odd situations that I've gotten into and may not find it funny.""


So he worries about how it might go. He is anxious to try out ""the inside material"" to see if it takes with his West Coast Asian American audience as well as it does in New York. He is sure and confident and, even as he expresses concern in finding that audience, he jokes.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Curtis Namba, president of the Asian Bar Association of Sacramento, says there's a disquieting practice in Northern California of challenging Asian American judges who seem to be vulnerable because of politics, ethnicity or money.


It's a practice that infuriates Namba and accounts for why he, along with the ABAS, has organized a fundraiser Thursday, May 12 in Sacramento for the reelection of Municipal Court Judge John Oda.


The former Contra Costa County assistant district attorney is being challenged for the Berkeley-Albany Judicial District judgeship by Jennie Rhine, a former administrative law judge for the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board. Currently Rhine, 48, is a hearing officer for San Francisco's Office of Citizens' Complaints.


The fundraiser, held from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at Saga Sushi, 2315 Northgate Blvd. in Sacramento, is expected to draw attorneys from all over California, and is co-sponsored by the Asian Bar Association of Sacramento, the Asian Pacific Bar of California and the statewide coalition of Asian American bar associations.


Organizers report that in addition to ticket sales, news of next week's fundraiser has even generated donations from concerned citizens and lawyers who aren't able to attend.


""I think this is a critically important event and it is an infuriating practice... minority judges being challenged by opportunists who view them as an easy pass to get in. It smacks subtly of racism,"" said Namba.


He pointed out that the challenge to Oda's judgeship is similar to an incident that occurred two years ago, when Municipal Court Judge Cerena Wong of Sonoma County was challenged following her appointment by the Gov. George Deukmejian. Despite the challenge Wong was reelected based on her record, and with the support of the Asian and non-Asian friends.


Namba said the ABAS is holding the fundraiser because the group is concerned with Asian judges in all counties and wants to sound off to all potential challengers.


""If the perception is that Asian Americans and other minorities are easy targets or paths to judgeship by challengers, they have a lot to learn,"" said Namba.


""Anyone who takes this role had better have a lot of support too, because minority judges will not be isolated and defeated.""


Donation for the reelection of John Oda fundraiser is $25, which goes entirely to the Committee to Retain Judge John Oda. All expenses for the fundraiser will be paid by the law firms of Chong & Namba and Tosh Yamamoto. For more information or tickets contact Namba at (916) 443-7398.

A meeting of minds and hearts, and pockets. Or how else call the soiree tendered for visiting playwright Marina Feleo Gonzalez, here for a week to kick off her latest work, ""A Song for Manong,"" due to premier at the Herbst Theatre on Feb. 22?


The rainbow of personalities who attended the party mirrored the fact that Filipinos want a cultured center they can call their own. Or at least take a step toward building one. That begins with sorties like the Thursday, Jan. 28 reception at the social hall of the Philippine Consulate where capitalists rubbed pinstripes with activists and the glitterati toasted the culturati for setting the pace. Our community is such: In this corner you have these lawyers who wield the biggest political influence. In that corner you have the social advocates. Over there you have the intellectual derelicts, as an intimate calls those who know how much they know and care about little else. Hereabouts are the munificent few looking for deserving beneficiaries for their generosity. Bringing these people together is a monstrous order, but who put a patent on trying? Likha, co-producers of ""A Song,"" threw its hat in the ring and woke up the next day without a migraine.


The Dream Team: if we could cut away at the biases, shelve the personal agendas, imagine what we could accomplish?


Where do they get all that energy? This early, Rod McLeod deserves a medal for being where he is needed when he is needed most. He's always on time and goes beyond the back-slapping perfunctories. In his signature Ivy League accent, he drawled for the playwright, of whom he said he had heard so much.


The same apparently went for Feleo Gonzalez, because the week she was here, McLeod was all over town cutting down that ""relic of the past,"" or what he called hazing, if indeed it were being practiced in McAteer High.


McLeod was nine when his family immigrated to this country from R.P. When he endorsed Marina's play as ""important to our education,"" he was certainly talking about his own, including that of his wife, Janna, whom he met in Korea while he was with the Peace Corps. Janna, said the education commissioner, is keen on learning more about Filipino culture.


Library Commissioner Dennis Normandy fulfilled his promise to drop by despite a previous engagement, just to welcome the venerable author.


Spearhead of any Filipino business organization that matters (Chamber of Commerce, Professionals and Businessmen's Association) Johnny Collas proved that he's a well-rounded individual by showing up at a non-political, non-business event.


Rodel Rodis squeezed his bit for culture between his homework as the only Filipino appointed to the mayor's advisory board on appointments, and his law practice. (Rodis admirers worry that Rodis' appointment to the task force will preclude him from commissionership which seems highly unlikely considering there are 49 other people poring over nominees' resumes. To be sure, someone will submit Rodis' dossier). Because he arrived late, Rodis was greeted by the night's emcee Beth Rosales with a sponsorship pledge card. Momentarily flustered, the lawyer droned ""What's this? I shouldn't have come ..."" but gamely forked over a handsome check for ""benefactor"" tickets anyway.


Look who attended a community function for the first time. Guillermo ""Yong"" Nieva and his wife Debbie. Since Yong established his insurance office in South City, he has been fenced away from anything outside of the business. Yep, even if Debbie works in the Philippine Airlines office on 447 Sutter St., a.k.a. the home of the Philippine consulate. The couple globetrotted through their courtship (they were flight attendants for PAL) but both insist on inculcating Filipino values in their U.S.-born children. Debbie, who was born to a Scandinavian mother and Filipino father here in the U.S., is one of the few FilAms I know who speaks better Tagalog than I.


Tito Osias made a cameo appearance, drove all the way from Mountain View where he manages his Menu Tree, the fast food center of the San Antonio Mall. Tito is a true son of the ""manong."" His grandfather, the late Camilo Osias, was the Philippine Resident Commissioner to the U.S. at the height of the anti-Filipino race riots of 1930. You could say Tito puts to full circle his family's inovlvement with the Ilocanos in Northern California.


Just to illustrate the cross-section of Filipinos represented at the kick-off: Anita Sanchez, Wendell Michelob and Ted Laguatau in animated conversation; Ronaldo Carunungan, a Palo Alto bookkeeper, poured the victuals ($1 donation per); Vicky Flores and Gene Torres of the East Bay Filipino Network perked up the buffet with FilAm lipsmackers (eat-all-one-can). Baby Prieto, Bobbie Espino Espino Blankenhorn, and Suki Riego rendezvoused with Benjie Macapinlac who had come late because he had to lock up his Daly City megamarket, Orient King.


The word is out: after three years Naomi and Antonio de Castro are premiering their documentary on Filipino American history, ""In No One's Shadow"" on March 31 probably (Antonio's adverb) at the Pacific Bell building convention hall. The 28-minute saga cost $70,000 to complete and is narrated by a true-to-life firefighter who has trouble pronouncing the word ""manong."" Accent on the first syllable, please. Beyond that lingual quirk, the film rivets. Caught it at one of the de Castros' previews. And on Feb. 20, Jess Cabrera and Anne Almendral will launch DIWA, a forum for Filipino creative creatures.


Sorely missed at the ""A Song"" launch was Congen Virgilio Nanagas who was very present as host the next night at the same place to introduce the personnel of a newly-created department in his office. Naturally I had to tell him that I already had the pleasure of the acquaintance of Vicky Legarda and Cherry Aguinaldo, also culture officer Lulu Cauton and librarian Olive Alvarez who were the earlybirds at the cocktail the night before. Hold the hurrahs, girls. This is not an all-female team here. Consul Shulan Primavera heads the office, but only until July. Too bad. Primavera has been reassigned to Manila.

Asian Week heralds the Cherry Blossom Festival in San Francisco's Japantown this week, as evidenced by the fine cover illustration by up-and-coming graphic artist Wilson Guo.


The publication of the drawing is also our way of encouraging talented young Asian Americans. The drawing is the result of an internship program designed to help young people more full-develop their skills.


Asian Week intern Wilson Guo is a high school student at the International Studies Academy in San Francisco, where he is completing his senior year.


The intricate ink drawing presented on page 1 of this week's issue was completed by the 18-year-old artist in four hours following careful study of a photograph of a classic Japanese kabuki theatre character.


""I worked on this print from a picture I found,"" said Guo. ""I carefully recreated it in art form using black ink and a fine point pen.""


Born in Canton, Guo moved to the United States in 1984 with his parents and two brothers and settled in San Francisco.


He plans to attend the College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland after graduating from high school this June.


""I plan to study graphic arts at the four-year college so I can achieve my goal to become a graphic designer."" But until then Guo said he will continue to study art on his own and practice painting and drawing in his spare time.

The putting of one minority group against another is a very real concern for many Asian American educators and students.


""It is the best interest of those in power never to allow a coalition of Asians, blacks, and Hispanics,"" said Dotson Wilson, legislative chair of the Black American Political Association of California.


He stressed that all minorities needed to avoid the trap that will ultimately be set. ""That trap is designed to divide and conquer,"" he said. An example is when black students are told that the increase of Asian students will decrease the number of black students admitted.


According to Michael Stoll, chair of the Afro American Students Association at UC Berkeley, this is exactly what they were told by the administration when they demanded more admission slots for black students.


Black and Asian student organizations reviewed the issue together. They realized that Asian students didn't affect the number of black students admitted because admission slots for black students were protected by affirmative action policies.


""Asians being admitted to the University of California in record numbers only does one thing. It threatens the number of white students that are able to attend the university,"" said Wilson.


""The notion of Asian admission versus black admission is a disguised form of reverse racism,"" said Wilson. ""If we recognize that, we're in excellent shape.""


He cited the future projections of California's demographics. By the year 2000 California will be a state where minorities will make up the majority of the population. Currently Asians, Hispanics and blacks represent 40 percent of the state's population.


""When you become the majority of a state in terms of population, you begin to hold the key to political power.""


Bill Chavez, chief consultant to the Assembly Education Committee, talked about issues both causing friction and communality between Latinos and Asians.


The Latino community is concerned that its numbers and those of other underrepresented minorities are not increasing as they should, given California's population shift. Retention of admitted students is another major problem.


""We're losing far too many students after they're admitted,"" said Chavez.


Areas where Latinos and Asians have a common interest, said Chavez, is in bilingual education, and immigration services and classes.


The next step for Asian Americans in Higher Education will be to apply for non-profit status. Already people have volunteered to organize next year's conference which will be in Southern California.

Winners


Sound/Seen, the performance group composed of Brenda Wong Aoki, Mark Izu, Louis Jordan, and Sachiko Nakamura, received an Arts Touring Grant from the California Arts Council on July 18. It will enable them to tour with 50 percent of their fees automatically paid. Earlier the group won a $2000 a year . . . Grant from CAC, for 1988-89.


Keith Chun, a tall, handsome actuary from New York City, won $12,801 on the NBC television quizz show, ""Jeopardy,"" July 20. Chun, father of three, including two little girl twins, did not, however, tackle a question involving the Great Wall of China.


Battle Over Thai Art


A 900-year-old sculpture from a temple in Thailand is the bone of contention between representatives of that country and the Art Institute of Chicago. The piece, a two and one-half long by three feet wide lintel missing from the . . . temple of Phnom Rung, depicts the Hindu God Vishnu reclining on water, and dates from the country's Khmer dynasty (805-1250 A.D.).


A Thai delegation, headed by Prince Subhadradis Diskul, was indignant at Art Institute proposals of an exchange of the work for the loan of other works of art, according to AP. Said the prince, ""The feeling of the people of Thailand is that it is stolen, and they think that if it is stolen, and they think that if it is stolen, we shouldn't have to send anything in return.""


The Institute contends that the law is on its side; the sculpture was bought originally from a dealer in Bangkok, and passed through several hands before coming to the Institute.


On July 4, 30 Thai students protested outside the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, and members of the Thai Vishnu Lintel Committee have staged like protests outside the Chicago Art Institute.

""I'm on a Mission from Buddha"" by Lane Nishikawa, will be the next offering of the Asian American Theater Company, at the end of August.


Nishikawa, who is also the performer in this one-man show, says it is a sequel to his hit ""Life in the Fast Lane,"" in which he portrayed nine characters, coping with such matters as what it is like to grow up as a Japanese American, as an artist, writer and actor, and being from Hawaii, where he was part of a majority and coming to the Mainland where he was not.


One of the pieces in ""LitFL"" concerned ""Japanese Junkies"" -- how Asian Americans are portrayed in the media, mainly TV, and commercialized thereby. Nishikawa continues this theme in his new work; the ""Buddha"" of the title comes from ""Buddha-heads,"" a Hawaiian term for Japanese.


In the new work, he maintains, he is concerned with ""where the Japanese spirit is,"" and looks at three generations: the Issei from Japan, the second-generation Nisei, and his own, the Sansei. ""My own generation are basically yuppies,"" upwardly mobile, moving to places like Silicon Valley. I am trying to find out if the spirit brought over by my grandfather's generation is still present.


Nishikawa visited Japan in 1985. ""I felt very much at home, but also I felt American.


""Yet I almost had my own spirit rekindled.""


This talented writer-actor's new work sounds both sensitive and provocative, and something to look forward to.


Asian Films


The series on Japanese director Kon Ichikawa continues at the Pacific Film Archive, University Art Museum, Berkeley, on Sun., July 31, with two motion pictures.


""The Burmese Harp"" (Birumano Tategoto, 1956) (7 p.m.) catapulted its director to international fame, winning the Venice Film Festival prize. An army scout who plays the harp is sent by his British captors to inform an obstinate fighting unit of Japan's surrender. He is too late; they are all dead. He becomes a monk, and remains in Burma to bury the dead and expiate the sins of war. ""As a dramatization of the conflicts between men in war it is unparalleled, and as an elegy of Japan's war dead it is haunting, linking the simple beauty of music ... with a sense of loss.""


""The Outcast"" (""The Sin,"" Hakai, 1962) is called ""an anguished, revealing film about the little-known caste system in Japan."" An outcast's ancestors performed tasks considered unclean by Buddhists: as butchers, leather craftsmen, grave-diggers. The story, from a controversial 1906 novel, now a classic, centers on a young teacher, torn between revealing his descent and ""coming out"" against the caste system's injustice.


Western Film


""Big Top Pee-Wee"" stars Pee-Wee Herman, winner of six Emmy Awards for his TV children's show ""Pee-Wee's Play-house"" and a genuine comic talent. This is the first time I've seen him, having missed his ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" which I'm told was better.


He's a strange one, dressed in nerdy, too-tight suit, red bow tie, and white shoes. He seems half-child, half-fey, and much of this circus opus is genuinely charming.


Pee-Wee is a farmer who talks to the animals (and at least one of them, Vance the pig, talks back to him) and raises super-sized vegetables. He even has a hot dog tree, with the laudable goal of feeding the world.


He lives in a hostile small town, composed apparently completely of nasty senior citizens. He is engaged to a saccharine blond school teacher. Then the circus comes, and with it an Italian trapeze artiste. Our hero is torn between the two women, and also out to be a big circus star.

I heeded a friend's advice and took a sunrise flight to Chicago for a long-needed change of pace, and space. I didn't want to but this same friend had spoken with much authority having just returned from her New York' respite.


""You have to leave San Francisco to know how much you love it."" She waxed lyrical, sounding there for a moment like me, I thought. My plan was to foil the much-publicized 100-degree temperature with an expensive sunscreen, a reed mat, a cheap novel and all the time in my hands at the shores of Lake Michigan. Get away from the routine pig out, walk barefoot, avoid the papers, and above all, steer clear of telephones and typewriters. Well guess what?


Tell me if this is a Filipino peculiarity but I have yet to leave home and not find or make friends while on vacation. Relatives run rampant (you know how prolific we are) but acquaintances should be somewhat rarer.


A dear, dear friend, Marichelle Roque Lutz, with whom I had worked while she and I were pushing pens for the Philippine News wanted me to breathe in, if only for a night, the environs that she stalked as Chicago bureau editor.


She has since relocated to Philadelphia with her agriculture engineer-husband David and was perhaps aching too to say goodbye to her old milieu. ""You have to see the Rizal Center,"" she declared, and forthwith collected me from my downtown perch for a cruise of her (former) city, but of its Filipino enclaves first.


The Rizal Center, named after the Philippines' national hero (was he ever in Chicago? Marichelle wasn't sure) stood formidable in the waning summer glow.


Hardly had we stepped out of the car when Lutz began holding court outside the building door, having spotted some folks who had lived in her column. I was glad to have stuffed my purse with business cards despite my determination to make this a fortnight to depressurize because by the time my hour's tour of the center was up, I knew my rest 'n' rec was over.


Eat your heart out, San Francisco: Chicago's Filipinos have their center, a three-story beauty with hand-carved doors flown all the way from the Philippines.


""This was built from Marcos money but management changed with the ascent of President Aquino,"" Marichelle whispered, letting on that, like their California counterparts, Filipinos there are enmeshed in Philippine politics.


Here they elect their officials, endorse their candidates, crown their beauty queens, have their Filipino buffet sweetened with live entertainment. In the chummy cafeteria atmosphere of its basement, people pop up and exchange views, share triumphs, drown sorrows or just show themselves.


Others, like Ben Albovias, come by to announce their latest projects. His is Immigration to the United States, a compilation of his legal advice columns in Via Times, a popular community paper published by Filipina Veronica Leighton.


""My book is written for lay people in a concise and informative manner to enable them to understand the processes of the immigration service."" Albovias interrupted his dinner to give a sneak preview of his opus. He said his work could be a ""valuable source of information for lawyers who occasionally may be presented with immigration problems.""


Considering there are about 100,000 Filipinos in Chicago alone (multiply) that to the number of relatives awaiting petition in RP), Albovias should have a ready-to-read audience.


The book is scheduled for launch in mid-September in Chicago. It is probably the first to be written by an Asian American from the Midwest. The author has been practicing law since 1976 after completing international law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago and the Manuel L. Quezon School of Law in Manila.


Albovias came to Chicago in 1968 upon the prodding of his mother who had been working as a nurse there. He had already been practicing criminal law for four years in Maila when he uprooted. Today, his Chicago office handles immigration and family law, personal injury and civil matters for a ""mixed clientele.


Contrary to common impression, he said, Filipinos in his area prefer to assign their legal concerns to non-Filipino lawyers. ""The believe that mainstream attorneys have more clout and can better serve their interests"" is a reason why there are few Filipino cases in Albovias' files.


Ben's original plan was to enjoin all 17 licensed Filipino lawyers in Illinois to publish an immigration textbook. But just as his dream to organize an association of all 17 lawyers had been a failure, so was this textbook.


""The trouble with Filipinos here is that everyone wants to be chief and no one wants to a brave"" he complained. Undiscouraged, he plunged solo as publisher, writer and editor and is all set to promote Immigration to the United States all over the country, with San Francisco as a major launching pad.


There could be dozens of Filipino cooks in Chicago's hostelries but there may be only one sous chef in Cook County. Greg Melchor had whipped up breakfasts and banquets for kings in Saudi Arabia and politicians in in Virginia before moving to Chicago to upgrade the kitchen of Shaw's Crabhouse, a chain of seafood restaurants.


Being a breath away from executive chef, Melchor can perform any chore worthy of his tongue. He can't help attracting attention at hotel and restaurant workers' conventions because he is always the only Filipino sous chef present. If he has made it, why haven't others, he asks? Could his wife Mara be right when she reminds him that the opportunity is open to all, but not all have Greg's drive and talent?

Asian Americans account for 6.1 percent of the employees at the nation's top 50 banks, and 4.6 percent at the top 150 banks.


Twice as many Asian American women as men hold jobs at banks, outnumbering the men in all but two job classifications, according to a new study.


The American Bankers Association released a report Monday showing employment statistics for the top 50 and 150 banks in the country. According to the ABA, the number of minority members in top management positions in the largest 150 banks has doubled in the past decade.


In 1988 the 8,836 Asian males working for the top 150 banks accounted for 1.5 percent of the total 581,053 employees. The 7.535 Asian males working at the top 50 banks accounted for 2 percent of the total 370,407.


Outnumbering the men two to one, there were 18,022 Asian American women working at the top 150 banks, or 3.1 percent. And 15,340 of those Asian women worked at the top 50 banks, 4.1 percent of the total employees at those institutions. Asian men in top management positions numbered 1,677 at the top 150 institutions and 1,431 at the top 50. Asian women in top management numbered 2,168 and 1,924, respectively.


The largest number of Asian American employees worked in office and clerical positions. Asian women outnumbered Asian men almost three to one in this category, with 12,161 at the top 150 banks and 10,176 at the top 50. Asian males in this category numbered 4,456 and 3,800, respectively.


There were large numbers of Asian American men and women in professional positions, but their proportions in this category were lower than for all positions.


There were 1,472 Asian men professional ((1.8 percent) in the top 150 banks and 1,216 2.2 percent) at the top 50. The figures for women in this category were 2,233 (2.7 percent) and 1,881 (3.4 percent).


Asian American men outnumbered women in the technician and craft worker categories. There were 677 Asian male technicians (4.1 percent of total technicians) at the top 150 banks and 592 (5.4 percent) at the top 50 banks, compared to 533 and 476 Asian women, respectively.


Asian American women accounted for 9.5 percent of operatives at the top 150 banks, and 11.4 percent at the top 50. Asian American men accounted for 5.5 percent and 6.8 percent.

BERKELEY -- After a year of intensive study and deliberation, the Admissions and Enrollment Committee of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate last week issued a report proposing substantial changes in admissions policies at the University of California at Berkeley.


The changes are planned to go into effect in the fall of 1991. The committee will coordinate implementation with UC Berkeley's Admissions Coordinating Board.


A central theme of the report is that the rapid recent rise in applications at Berkeley should make it possible to attract a student body that is both stronger academically and more diverse socially and economically than ever before.


Its specific recommendations are designed to accomplish both these objectives. The report offers a vision of Berkeley as a ""genuinely pluralistic environment in which the best students from all segments of California's diverse population can meet and debate in an atmosphere of enlightenment and commitment.""


Among the most noteworthy changes proposed by the committee is the addition of a category of socioeconomically disadvantaged students among the groups receiving ""secondary review"" (i.e., special consideration). This category would be open to all disadvantaged applicants, regardless of race or ethnicity.


Another ""secondary review"" category targeting mature or ""re-entry"" applicants would also be created. It is anticipated that most of the students admitted in this category would be women.


Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman called the committee's report a timely and comprehensive review of campus admissions policy.


""It lays the groundwork for helping the campus to continue to raise our academic standards while furthering the process of cultural and socioeconomic diversification. I welcome this review,"" Heyman said. ""The report's recommendations will no doubt stimulate widespread discussion during the coming months, both on campus and in the community. I look forward to a period of fruitful discussion among all interested parties before new policies are implemented.""


The committee's report, entitled ""Freshman Admissions at Berkeley: A Policy for the 1990s and Beyond,"" was issued in the context of increasing competition for admission into Berkeley's fall freshman classes with more than 20,000 students applying in recent years for approximately 3,400 places.


The committee sets forth 10 principles guiding admissions policy at Berkeley. This is perhaps the first time that a major institution of higher education has publicly declared such principles.


They are:


""Berkeley should accept only those students who have a reasonable chance of persisting to graduation.


Berkeley will absolutely not tolerate quotas or ceilings on the admissions or enrollment of any racial, ethnic, religious, or gender groups.


As an institution of international renown and as one of the nation's leading research universities, Berkeley has an obligation to admit students with exceptionally distinguished academic records.


As a taxpayer-supported public university, Berkeley must strive to serve all of California's people.


Berkeley should actively seek diversity -- socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic, racial, and geographic -- in its student body.


In its admissions criteria, Berkeley will recognize outstanding accomplishment in a variety of spheres, including (but not limited to) art, athletics, debating, drama, music.


While continuing to grant preference to California residents, Berkeley will continue to admit out-of-state students.


The admissions process should include a human element and must not be based on grades and test scores alone.


In constructing and altering Berkeley's admissions practices, the faculty should insist upon at least a co-equal role with the administration.


The admissions criteria and practices of the Colleges of Letters and Science as well as the professional schools should continue to be described in detail and to be made fully available to the public.


The report was approved unanimously by the nine-member committee, which is primarily a faculty body, with two student members and an ex-officio member of the administration. The chair of the committee is Jerome Karabel of the department of sociology, and the report has now been submitted to Berkeley's academic senate.


The 57-page report includes a detailed analysis of the historical and demographic context of Berkeley admissions.


The committee notes that California will become, between 2000 and 2010, the first mainland state without a majority racial group.


According to the report, by 2004 more than 400,000 students will graduate from California high schools, compared to approximately 250,000 today. The majority of these students are projected to be Hispanic, black and Asian.


The report was issued in the wake of a bitter controversy on the Berkeley campus over allegations of discrimination against Asian Americans, who comprise about 26 percent of undergraduates. In March, a joint statement was released by Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman and members of the Asian American Task Force on University of California Admissions acknowledging that policies adopted in 1983-84 had a disproportionatel negative impact on Asian Americans while urging Berkeley to look to the future rather than the past.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The AIDS Task Force, a consortium of foundations and corporate giving programs in Northern California, announced Monday it is granting $40,000 to Asian Health Services in Oakland to help fight the spread of AIDS in the Asian communities.


The task force made the donation in conjunction with grants to three other agencies serving Latinos, American Indians and women to train culturally sensitive volunteers to provide care for persons with AIDS, according to a press release.


Also Asian Health Services will work to ""reduce high-risk behaviors among limited English-speaking Asian immigrants and refugees in the East Bay,"" reported the task force.


The task force gave a total of $651,500 to 23 Bay Area agencies.


One community leader close to the fight against AIDS, who asked not to be identified, expressed disappointment that only 6 percent of the money went to the only agency in 23 that provides AIDS-related services directly to the Asian American communities.


Kathy Lim Ko, operations director and leader of Asian Health Services' AIDS project, admitted that some health workers are frustrated at the apparent lack of interest on the part of funding sources.


""But there are two ways of looking at that,"" Ko said. ""Our agency got the third highest


""But it is true that many funding sources need to be educated about the Asian communities. We have a rapidly increasing rate of AIDS infection, but because it is still relatively low, we are in the rare position of being able to prevent the epidemic before it happens in the Asian community,"" she added.


The money would be used to beef up joint efforts of the East Bay Asian AIDS Coordinating Committee. Asian Health Services works closely with Filipino Immigrant Services and Asian Community Mental Health Services as well as Catholic Charities to fight AIDS.


The groups would extend their programs into Contra Costa County and develop outreach for the gay Asian community, Ko said.

LOS GATOS -- Does Los Gatos really want a college or is there another reason why its people are denying a Taiwanese businessman an access road to his school?


The former Guadalupe College, nestled in the Los Gatos mountains among breathtaking greenery surrounded by lush green foliage and oak trees, has sparked heated debate. The town council and residents living in the area oppose the school and have denied Kang Ming Ho any means of reaching his college from existing available routes.


When Ho purchased the 55-acres property from the Sisters of Charity order of nuns in 1986 for $6 million, he had no idea that this would drag into a costly and lengthy battle and become one of the most controversial local topics in years.


Access to the school, which will be known as Western California University, has always been a problem due to the narrow, steep, winding road leading up to it. Occupants living on Foster Road protested Ho's use of the road even though the Sister of Charity occupied the property from 1961 until last year. Aware that it was the only access road, residents didn't complain much because the cloistered order of nuns made very few trips down the hill.


Ho was aware that he had to build a road and has been dealing with strict building regulations. The Los Gatos Council approved a conditional use permit on Oct. 7, 1986 for Ho to build, a 30-foot-wide paved road through 170 acres of scenic open space on St. Joseph's Hill to connect the college at the top of the hill with Alma Bridge Road near Highway 17.


In 1986 Jack Stewart, an engineer for Creegan & D'Angelo, hired by the city of Los Gatos, did an extensive study of the roads with easement and environmental supplemental reports. Despite repeated hearings Stewart's findings were not accepted by the council.


Determined to carry on with his plans. Ho has again requested a one-year extension but is faced with opposition from a group representing the Citizens for the Preservation of St. Joseph Hill.


Doug Lincoln, president of the group's 700 members, at one of the council meetings objected to building on Alma Bridge Road saying it would close approximately 3,250 lineal feet of existing trails and accessway that was formerly available to hikers, joggers and mountain bike riders. Also cited were possible dangers from asbestos and loss of unique vegetation, both associated with the serpentine-limestone rocks and soils in the path of the woods. The excavation of approximately 60,000 cubic yards of soil, could release asbestos fibers in the air and soil and eventually into the water supply.


These arguments were not ignored by the Town Council on May 15 and Limekiln Road was suggested as the next alternate choice. This route is favored because it avoids coming in contact with the open space preserve and could be built almost exclusively on Ho's land.


Ho's attorney, Thomas S. Jordan of San Jose, objected to the suggestion because Ho's engineers had studied the two routes and felt the Limekiln Road was too steep and too . . . to work on. Jordan stated that accidents occurring on a private road on private property would be Ho's responsibility and that he doesn't want to be faced with lawsuits. Jordan feels that Alma Bridge is the best of both choices because there would be less scarring of the land and not as much displacement of dirt.


Alan Young, a mechanical engineer who lives on Foster Road, suggested that the town could . . . Ho and easily recoup its money by demolishing the college buildings which in any event may not be up to present earthquake standards. Another suggestion was to sell the land in lots for private residences. Three or four homeowners who eventually would live on the college site would pose no problem and could use Foster Road without a significant increase in road traffic.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Senator Pete Wilson called upon the Chinese government to open dialogue between the government and its people in an effort for a peaceful resolution during a press conference held this week in Chinatown.


The senator's conference, attended by Asian American community leaders and many Chinese elderly, was called after weeks of protest in China's capital of Beijing where thousands of students are demanding freedom and democracy.


""The Chinese government must enter into a good faith, meaningful dialogue with its people to begin to resolve the conflict between their just demands and the present authoritarian response of the government to them."" Wilson said.


The California senator, slated to run for governor in 1990, also praised the courage of Chinese students leading the massive protest for democratic reform. This week their efforts resulted in the government's implementation of martial law.


Wilson said in America too often basic freedoms are taken for granted but that in Beijing it's another case. Wilson said that in the People's Republic of China freedom represents a real threat to those in power.


Wilson lashed out at the Chinese government for imposing news blackouts on foreign journalists within the country and for jamming the Voice of America. The short wave radio transmissions from the Philippines had been providing eager Chinese residents with their country's only news.


""The international community and the people of China have the right to know what is happening,"" said Wilson. ""Only in this way can we be assured that the People's Republic of China is a place in which students and ideas are safe.""


He called the radio jamming a refusal to admit that the reform demanded by the students is an idea whose time has come in China.


Change has surfaced in China whether the present leaders are willing to recognize it or not, according to Wilson. He added that China will never be the same after these weeks of protest for freedom.


Wilson also called for China to pursue a meaningful course leading to the establishment of basic human rights in that country. Without basic human rights China will forfeit the respect and trust of the civilized nations of the world, he said.


The senator said he joins President George Bush and Secretary of State James Baker who have called for restraint and calm on the part of the Chinese government.


""I join with them and with all the Chinese here in this nation in hope of a peaceful resolution.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) will celebrate its 20th anniversary it a fundraising dinner to be held at 6 p.m. on Thursday, June 1 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel.


Congressman Robert Matsui D-Sacramento) will be the keynote speaker for the dinner honoring Loni Ding, Gordon Lew, Professor Tien Chang-Lin and Joe Yuey, CAA will use proceeds from the fundraising dinner to support its civil rights activities, employment counseling and job placement services, and anti-discrimination efforts.


Congressman Robert Matsui was elected to the U.S. Congress In 1978 and co-sponsored the bill which provided redress to Japanese Americans who were interned during World War II. CAA recently worked successfully with Rep. Matsui to stop the U.S. Census Bureau from lumping all Asians together in a single category for the 1990 Census.


Rep. Matsui will join CAA in honoring Loni Ding, a television and film producer; Gordon Lew, publisher of East/West newspaper; Professor Tien Chang-Lin, executive vice chancellor, UC Irvine; Joe Yuey, a restaurateur and community elder. All will be honored for their years of service to the Asian American community.


CAA's founding 20 years ago marked the beginning of an era of Asian American civil-rights activism in S.F. and throughout California.


A group of university students and community activists formed CAA in late 1969 to promote equal job opportunities for Chinese Americans. The catalyst for CAA's formation was the construction of the Chinatown Holiday Inn (and the Chinese Culture Center) in S.F. Despite assurances that Chinese Americans would be equitably employed on the project, only four of 200 construction workers were Chinese. Community protests caused Holiday Inn to agree to hire at least 80 percent Chinese Americans to staff their Chinatown hotel.


During the next 20 years CAA grew from a group with a volunteer staff and a donated one-room office to a professional civil rights organization with a full-time staff of nine and permanent offices in S.F.


In addition to its civil rights activities. CAA provides job counseling and placement to more than 1,500 clients each year; annually assists more than 125 Asian Americans in job discrimination cases; and works with its Employer Advisory Council to promote upward mobility for Asian American workers.


Highlights of CAA's first 20 years include:


1970-present: CAA pressures the U.S. Census Bureau to accurately count Asian Americans, and assists with the counting. CAA successfully urges Census Bureau to count Asians in nine ethnic categories instead of one all-encompassing Asian category for the 1990 Census.


1970: CAA helps file suit, in the landmark case ""Lau v. Nichols,"" which winds up in Supreme Court. The court's decision mandates that San Francisco provide bilingual instruction and texts for its Chinese-speaking students.


1970: CAA forms its Chinese Media Committee to promote equal employment opportunities for Chinese Americans, fight racist stereotypes in the media and to produce programs relevant to the needs of Chinese Americans. In 1970 Loni Ding produces (with KPIX) 65 half-hour bilingual programs to teach conversational English to Chinese immigrants. A weekly Chinese-language program, ""Chinese Community Hour,"" is launched on KQED-FM in 1971 (it is still on the air). The Emmy award-winning ""Bean Sprouts"" children's television series premieres in 1983.


1973: CAA files suit with Officers for Justice and other civil rights groups against the San Francisco Police Department for discrimination against minorities and women in hiring and promotion. A Consent Decree in 1979 forces the department to hire and promote minority and female officers, including Chinese bilingual officers.


1981: CAA organizes community opposition to the film, ""Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen,"" which forces the producers to cancel plans to film sequences in S.F.'s Chinatown. National media coverage of the controversy raises public awareness about racial stereotyping of Asians in the U.S.


1981: CAA forms its Employer Advisory Council -- comprised of representatives of large Bay Area corporations -- to promote increased employment opportunities for Asian Americans.


1986: CAA releases its ""Broken Ladder"" report, which documents discrimination against Asian Americans in promotion and advancement in City and County of S.F. Civil Service jobs. An update of the report, to be released in May 1989, will indicate that the discrimination continues.


1984-present: CAA researches and documents discrimination against Asian American students by the University of California. In April 1989 UC Berkeley admits that changes in its admission policies in 1984 have harmed Asian applicants. The University of California promises reforms, which CAA will closely monitor.


1989: CAA's ""Forum on Upward Mobility for Asian Americans"" (held in April at PG&E) attracts 300 participants. Releases results of Cabezas study where 2/3 of respondents cite racism, hostile corporate barriers and lack of mentoring as barriers to promotion.


Tickets for the fundraiser can be purchased at CAA or by calling (415) 982-0801. Individual tickets are $200, sponsor tables of 10 are $2,000, and corporate tables of 10 are $2,500.

WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration has proposed cutbacks in federal refugee aid that state officials say could cost San Francisco as much as $1.7 million next year.


One agency serving Southeast Asian refugees may be forced to charge fees for its assistance programs, Asian Week has learned.


Overall the Bush administration's budget for fiscal 1990, which starts in October, calls for a reduction of the refugee aid budget to $235 million from $367 million.


Social service funding which provides employment, English language training and other services designed to promote self-suffiency among refugees is also targeted in proposed administration cutbacks.


The bulk of San Francisco's funding would be lost in the elimination of targeted assistance programs which are administrated by the non-profit Private Industry Council of San Francisco.


Steve Arcelona of the PIC said that without the funding there will be 500 refugees currently receiving cash assistance who will not be getting language or job training.


Representatives of local agencies which provide refugee services, echoed that the proposed cutbacks would cut deeply into existing programs.


""Basically it would be devastating for our programs and the refugees we work with, said Nancy Betts, director of Catholic Charities' Refugee Employment Assistance Programs.


Betts pointed out that the majority of funds that come out of targeted assistance at REAP are used on vital employment services. ""Many refugees need these services, Betts stressed. ""There are more people that need them than there're programs for them now.""


The Center for Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement, a community-based social service agency, is another organization that bear the brunt of cutbacks.


""There have been steady cutbacks for the last four years or so, and they (programs) are very needed. It shouldn't be done,"" lamented Loretta Kruger, executive assistant at CSEARR.


Kruger stressed that programs funded under the federal targeted assistance system, like the cooks training program, provide participants the opportunity to acquire valuable job skills.


Kruger said that if the cutbacks are adopted, the agency will probably have to search for a private foundation to absorb the cutbacks or perhaps introduce fees for service.

SAN FRANCISCO -- On the surface, Chinatown seemed to have been spared by last week's earthquake. But underneath, many of its seniors became hidden victims.


""It really instilled great fear in them,"" said Anni Chung, Self Help for the Elderly's executive director. ""They were very scared when the buildings went pitch dark. A lot of them didn't know what to do.""


Electricity and water service in Chinatown weren't restored until two days later. ""Many of them went to bed hungry the night of the earthquake,"" said Chung.


The estimated 10,000 seniors in Chinatown weren't able to get news of the quake as quickly as the rest of The City. They had no power so they couldn't see the results, and radios were of no help because most of the seniors could not understand English.


The day after the quake, Self Help staff went out to check on many of the seniors and brought them food. Self Help got its electricity back later that day, and it was able to bring hot meals to about 1,000 seniors.


Overall, most of the seniors escaped life-threatening injuries, Chung said. They mainly sustained bruised legs and twisted ankles from roaming in the dark, but she knows of one who required seven stitches on her head. Chinese Hospital administrators treated several seniors for broken hips and others with minor injuries, but there were fewer injuries than expected.


What Chung fears most now is the condition of the buildings where the seniors live. Although the buildings may look like they had not sustained any damages externally, internally is where most of the problems lie.


She and her staff visited 20 buildings the day after the quake and noticed that plaster fell from some of the coilings and there were visible cracks on walls.


""It was like a horror movie inside the buildings,"" Chung recalled.


She said one elderly man slept sitting up because he was afraid the loosened plaster over his bed was going to rain down on his face. Others cowered in their beds with covers over their faces in fear of another jolt. They were so afraid to come out of their rooms that they had nothing to eat for as long as two days.


Self Help is trying to do anything it can to help out these seniors. Informal discussion groups have been set up in different buildings to help them vent their feelings of fear and uncertainties. They are a ""little bit leery"" doing any repairs because the buildings are privately owned, and Self Help does not want to interfere with the landlords.


According to Chung, the majority of the building where Chinatown elderly live are 70 to 80 years old. They reeveal many building code violations such as the lack of emergency lights, and fire escapes rendered useless because they are littered with trash and junk.


These buildings were already considered to be in sub-par condition, but the quake has made them worse. ""Some of us have been crying out like a voice in the wilderness,"" Chung said, ""even as long as 20 years ago, and today the the problem is only getting worse.""


She feels the buildings which the elderly inhabit in Chinatown might not be able to sustain another quake of the same intensity because they are old and made of bricks. ""We suspect a lot of them are not reinforceable,"" she said.


If there is one positive note, the recent quake has shown Self Help how to better handle another similar disaster in the future. Next time, Self Help facilities would be turned into a temporary shelter for seniors. Chung also plans to get a generator in case there is another power shortage.


Chung said Self Help was able to handle the recent earthquake crisis without many problems but added that contributions to the organization are always welcomed.

BOSTON -- The Asian American community here is outraged that a police detective found guilty of using excessive force against an Asian American in 1985 will be compensated more than the brutalized victim.


The recent settlement between the city of Boston and Long Guang Huang granted Huang $85,000 in compensation while police detective Francis Kelly received $115,000 for back pay, legal fees and damages. The settlement also included an agreement that Huang would drop his civil rights charges against the Boston Police Department.


The incident over four years ago involved Huang, who had immigrated to the U.S. only six months earlier, being arrested on charges of soliciting sex from a prostitute and assualting a police officer.


However Huang, a restaurant worker in his 50s, was found innocent by the court on all the charges while Kelly was found guilty by his department of miscounduct, filing inaccurate reports and using excessive force against the victim.


Kelly was subsequently suspended by his department for a year without pay. He then appealed to the court, which upheld the appeal granting back pay that exceeded the monetary compensation Huang received.


The settlement granted by the court outraged Asian Americans and the local Chinese community that totals some 21,000 of Boston's population of 600,000.


""We consider it a slap in the face,"" said Suzanne Lee, co-chair of the Committee to Support Long Guang Huang. ""This was the first time we were able to make the police department accountable, and then three or four years later they turn it around .... We have a long way to to go.""


Lydia Lowe, also a member of the committee, explained that Huang, prior to the the arrest and beating, was merely walking down the street in Chinatown near the red light district of the city.


She said he was then attacked by the plain-clothes policeman, who apparently made an association between Huang and a prostitute who was walking ahead of him.


In light of the recent settlement, the committee sent a letter last week to the mayor of Boston demanding that he take an unequivocal stand against police brutality, uphold justice and ensure police accountability to all residents.


Lowe said over the years there have been numerous reports of police brutality against blacks, but she asserted that these matters, much like the Huang case, have been swept under the rug.


""This is the first time the police department opened up its internal investigation to the public -- so that we know that a police officer was actually disciplined,"" said Lowe.


Lowe said that while the settlement is closed and legal options for Huang appear to be nil because of his agreement, it will not stop others from protesting.


""Despite what happened, I think the effort that developed over the publicity of the beating and the suspension is significant -- even with the (legal) options closed, there has been progress,"" said Lowe.

WASHINGTON -- Rep. Robert Matsui re-introduced a bill on the 101st Congress's first day back in session this week that would ensure an accurate count of Asian Americans during the 1990 census.


The fate of the 1990 Census in regard to the tabulation of Asians is in limbo because the Census Bureau is withholding its decision on the tabulation of Asian groups using a checkoff system.


Last year the bureau promised lawmakers it would use the system; however, it decided to reevaluate its decision immediately after President Ronald Reagan's veto of a measure to require such a system.


The new bill would require the Census Bureau to use a checkoff format on the 1990 Census to tabulate Asian American ethnic groups and is similar to a measure introduced by Matsui last year.


Last year's measure received overwhelming support in both houses but was struck down by Reagan after the 100th Congress adjourned in October.


Henry Der, executive director of Chinese For Affirmative Action in San Francisco said he is ""highly suspicious"" of the Census Bureau's delay and said he supports legislative efforts to put the form in place.


""Matsui and other sympathetic legislators have no other choice but to push the bill through the 101st Congress,"" said Der. ""We certainly encourage and support this legislation.""


Ed Matovcik, aide to Matsui in Washington said the bill is on the fast track and is a high priority issue in Congress.


""It has the advantage of being passed in both the House and the Senate and it did enjoy good support,"" said Matovcik. ""I suspect it should speed through. It won't be starting out cold.""


But even on a fast track the bill could be up against tough barriers, according to Der.


""As the bill goes through the hearings, it will get harder to pass,"" speculated Der. ""If the printing of the (census) forms is in the works, we could have a drop-off of (legislators') support.""


Der said that Congress members, even if they support the bill, may be reluctant to support the measure if it would include incurring the cost of reprinting the forms at taxpayers' expense.


Der, who said it is not known if the forms have been printed, added that there is a time element to consider regarding the legislation and the fate of the form.


""There are only 15 more months until the 1990 Census, and that is not that far away. I suspect that (the forms) will be turned in around April 1, so they will have to be mailed in March. That's less than 15 months away,"" said Der.


Der stressed that most everyone has agreed that the 1980 form is the best one to use because it would tabulate information on nine Asian groups on a 100 percent basis.


He pointed out that the form the bureau has all along planned to use would lump Asians into one category and force respondents to write in their own specific ethnicity.


Supporters say if the checkoff form is not adopted, it will result an inaccurate count of Asians and Pacific Islanders, hurt the delivery of social services to the needy and disadvantaged and fail to generate detailed information to be used by government and businesses.


The bill, introduced Jan. 3, was co-sponsored by Reps. Norman Mineta, Daniel Akaka, Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, Don Edwards, Mervyn Dymally and Charles Pashayan Jr.

BERKELEY -- The Asian American Task Force on University Admissions lashed out at a UC Berkeley committee report that claimed admission policies at the campus are not guilty of long-term systematic discrimi-nation.


AATFUA members, with the support of the Student Coalition For Fair Admissions, labeled the findings in the draft report released this week ""erroneous and misleading.""


AATFUA members also expressed their anger at not being given the chance to review the report in advance of its release, as had been promised earlier by the university.


Henry Der, executive director of Chinese For Affirmative Action, along with other members of AATFUA were also upset that key questions were not answered by the report.


They said the Berkeley committee failed to answer the primary charge by the Berkeley Division: ""whether there has been significant bias either conscious or unconscious agamst Asian American freshmen applicants.""


The committee instead of addressing this question head on according to the ATFUA, decided to minimize the wrongdoings of 1984 by statistically distributing them over a period of seven years and also by using legal jargon to exonerate the University. In addition Der noted that the committee dismissed the input in the report of an Asian American key witness's accounts of racism as ""subjective impressions.""


The report was based on the findings of by an eight-member Special Committee On Asian American Admissions which was chaired by Willam Shack.


Members of the AATFUA said the faculty committee findings confirm what they consider to be a pattern of discriminatory policy initiatives in 1984, aimed specifically at making Asian American freshmen applicants less competitive with white applicants.


They pointed out that the study confirms that four university policy initiatives were targeted specifically at Asian American applicants.


Der estimated that over 200 Asians were affected by policies which included raising the GPA standard and a temporary establishment of a minimum SAT verbal score. Asians tend to score higher in the math section of the SAT.


""It did great harm to students and there has to be some assurance for future applicants that they will not become victims of discrimination,"" Der stressed.


Der also questioned why the university did not consider other non-discriminatory policy alternatives.


""All evidence clearly shows a pattern of discrimination, and they glossed over the real issue,"" said Jeff Chang, UC Berkeley student body president. ""It gets to the point that you call a spade a spade or give it a euphemism.""


The committee report admits and documents that significant discrimination in admissions against Asian American applicants occurred in 1984, however AATFUA members point out that ""the report conceals this discrimination by mathematically amortizing the data over a span of seven years and among the five colleges of the campus.""


Co-chairs of the AATFUA, San Francisco Judge Lillian Sing and Alameda Judge Ken Kawaichi stressed that evidence of the significant race-based bias in 1984 should not have been concealed regardless of the long-term effect as defined by the committee.


""The report is not academic material and was hastily conceived,"" stressed Sing.


The task force also voiced opposition to the use of supplemental criteria for student admissions.


They said that these criteria were ""hastily drawn up without any legitimate academic justification"" and that many have a built-in bias against Asian American applicants.


Despite the findings, the committee members said they were satisfied that some of the objectionable and discriminatory policies adopted since 1984 have been rescinded or modified.


Their plan now is to meet with both Chancellor Michael Heyman and Academic Senate Chairman John Heilbron to discuss the findings of the Shack Committee report's recommendations and to pursue the admission issues through legislative and legal channels.


Members of the two groups also intend to express their view on the Shack Committee report at a special hearing of the State Senate Select Committee on UC Admissions to be held March 13 at the Berkeley campus.

NEW YORK -- Asian American students are widely viewed as a ""model minority"" who adapt quickly and successfully to American ways. Students like Richard Yao are the reason why.


A ninth grader at Sun Yat Sen Intermediate School 131 in Chinatown, Yao was born on a farm outside Canton and arrived in the U.S. in 1982 at the age of eight. He worked hard at his studies because, as he put it, ""our families want others to think well of them."" Last year, writing in his second language, he won a prize in the Board of Education's annual poetry contest.


But consider, too, the case of one of his classmates, also a member of the ""model minority."" She has cut school more than 50 times this year, is failing major subjects and will probably be asked to repeat ninth grade. Teachers say that she has musical talent, but it, has gone undeveloped, according to Edward B. Fiske's ""Lessons"" column in The New York Times.


The contrast between Yao and his classmate and others like them is becoming increasingly worrisome to educators working with Asian American young people. The New York City Board of Education estimates that 13 percent of Asian American students drop out of high school. While this is half the official overall rate, it contrasts sharply with the popular stereotype that most Asian Americans are valedictorians on their way to Nobel Prizes.


""The stereotype is a compliment,"" said Virginia Kee, a teacher at Sun Yat Sen. ""But lots of Asian Americans need lots of help, and the stereotype makes it harder to get the resources to help them.""


A wide body of research has shown that the academic performance of immigrant children is strongly influenced by family background, parents and the circumstances that led to their arrival on American shores.


Among Hispanic American people, for example, the children of the middle-class Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's Cuba for political reasons have, as a group, fared better academically than the children of poorly educated Mexican farm workers who crossed-the Rio Grande out of economic desperation.


Likewise, the immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as the first boat people from Vietnam, who began creating the ""model minority"" image in the mid-'70s, were for the most part middle-class families who arrived with a passion for education.


Jane Shapiro, the assistant principal, recalls taking a group of students to the Metropolitan Museum and watching them startle bystanders by taking off their shoes. ""It was their way of showing how important the museum looked to them,"" she said.


But recent immigrants have come with different luggage. ""The change began when China opened up in the late '70s,"" said Betty Lee Sung, a City College sociologist. ""Poorly educated students from rural areas of China began to arrive as well as refugees from Southeast Asia. You don't have to be wealthy and educated to flee violence.""


These newer immigrants have the problems common to disadvantaged students of all backgrounds as well as a few special ones. With both parents working long hours, the students are frequently left on their own. ""The parents want them to do well in school, but since many of them don't speak English, they aren't in a position to be much help,"" said Archer Wah Dong, principal of Sun Yat Sen.


Some seventh graders arrive with no formal education. For others, schooling involved a few months of sitting on the benches listening to moral homilies from itinerant teachers.


In dealing with students who have been taught not to challenge authority, American teachers find it easy to misinterpret a student's silence as comprehension. Likewise, said Dong, students from a culture that discourages outward displays of emotion ""frequently have trouble adapting to a culture where you are supposed to deal with problems in terms of emotion.""


Teachers say the anti-intellectual strains of the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976 can be seen in students whose parents attended rural schools at that time. ""There's a whole group of young adults who did not have much schooling,"" Kee said. The flip side is that such students tend to be more assertive in class. ""They'll even tell you that your desk is a mess,"" Shapiro said.


The staff at Sun Yat Sen has developed techniques to meet these special needs. Newly arrived immigrants are put into a special ""Welcome School"" with small classes and assigned other students as their ""buddies"" to show them the ropes. Language classes emphasize oral communication, and teachers make use of peer tutoring.


Pace University has helped set up an after-school ""Stay in School"" program that offers counseling and recreational activities.


Teachers at Sun Yat Sen cite Richard Yao, whose parents were farmers with minimal education, as evidence that students from any background can succeed. Their odds are better, though, if the public does not assume that all Asian Americans fit the ""model minority"" image.

This year I have once again joined with the president of the United States in proclaiming the official observance of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Week. As governor, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of my thoughts and hopes on this upcoming commemoration.


America is a nation of immigrants, and California is a land of immigrants. One cannot truly understand our history or the course we've followed to greatness without appreciating the contribution of hard work, sacrifice, skill and determination of those whose ancestors, or who themselves, came here from the many nations of Asia and the Pacific Islands, including China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Southeast Asia.


Well over a century has passed since peoples from the many Pacific Rim countries started coming to California, and there are some who might have expected that the unique cultures and special traditions of these diverse groups would somehow fade with the passage of time. Fortunately, that has not been the case and, as a result, California's cultural treasure chest is full of gifts from the rich Asian Pacific heritage.


It is true that the Asian Pacific experience in California has not always been easy, and that in the past their achievements have not always been fully recognized or appreciated. But despite obstacles that have been placed in their way and the difficulties they've faced, they have persevered. In doing so, they have not only helped make California the cultural powerhouse it is today, but have also contributed significantly to its leadership in so many fields, from agriculture, science and industry to education, business and government.


It is clear, for example, that Asians and Pacific Islanders are playing a major role in creating growth and prosperity in California. This is evidenced, among other things, by the fact that we lead the nation in the number of Asian-owned businesses.


It is equally clear that individuals of Asian and Pacific heritage are serving the public well in state government, and I'm very proud of the mor than 230 superbly qualified men and women from these communities whom I've appointed to key positions in my administration and to the courts. I'm especially pleased to have had the opportunity to appoint the first person of Asian heritage, Justice Joyce Luther Kennard, to sit on the California Supreme Court.


I believe it is important that we recognize what a tremendous impact Asian and Pacific Americans are having on all aspects of California life, and we'll have this opportunity during the week of May 7-13. Furthermore, by encouraging all Californians to gain a better understanding of the people and cultures of Asia and the Pacific Islands, this occasion will help strengthen the cultural, economic and strategic ties we have with the nations of the Pacific Rim.


I have always considered California's ethnic diversity as one of our state's greatest strengths, and with unity and the full participation of our diverse and talented people, including the more than two and a half million Asians and Pacific Islanders who make their home here, I'm convinced that this great state can achieve even greater heights of excellence.

WASHINGTON -- Child care in the United States got a boost last week as the Senate approved a $1.75 billion measure that would expand day care and provide more money for low-income families across the nation.


The Senate voted 63 to 37 in favor of the Democratic-backed bill, but Republicans scurried to add amendments to it before the Senate takes a final vote. California Democrat Alan Cranston voted for the measure while Republican Pete Wilson voted against it.


Under the Democratic plan $1.75 billion would be distributed to distributed to low-income families for child care. Liz Castro, an aide to Cranston, said about 8 percent of that money would be dispersed to states through grants to help expand child care programs. She added that the grants would help slow down the high turnover rate among child care providers and provide start-up money for the creation of more facilities.


The plan creates a new tax credit of up to $500 to help low-income families buy health insurance for their children and would expand a tax credit for working families, giving cash to those too poor to pay taxes. The legislation also would require states to adopt minimum health and safety standards for child care centers.


Republicans argued that the bill is too costly and doesn't allow parents to choose child care because of the minimum federal standards that will be set concerning the facilities. In addition, said Wilson aide James Lee, a whole new Washington bureaucracy for child care would have to be created.


""The needs of those in the Midwest are not the same as those on the West Coast; why should somebody in Washington be making the decisions for someone else?"" asked Lee. ""Each state should be responsible for the child care they need... we should place the power in state and local hands.""


Lee said the bill is ""timely and people need it"" but admitted President Bush would probably veto it the way it is written now.


Meanwhile Democrats and Republicans are still haggling over compromises on the child care bill. ""But I think we will see a child care bill passed this year,"" said Castro.

LOS ANGELES -- Two weeks after the national broadcast of the documentary film ""Who Killed Vincent Chin?"", another Chinese man was allegedly killed last week by two whites in Raleigh, North Carolina, who mistook him for a Vietnamese.


Chin, a Chinese American, was beaten to death several years ago in Detroit by two whites who allegedly blamed the ailing automobile industry on Japanese and thought that he was one. For their crimes, the killers received incredibly light sentences of three years of probation and $3,780 fines.


In Raleigh, on the evening of July 28, Ming Hai Loo, 24, was playing pool at the Cue & Spirts Pool Hall with some friends, while two brothers, Robert and Lloyd Piche, came on the scene, Lt C. R. Stinson of the Raleigh Police Department told Asian Week.


The population of Raleigh is about 71 percent white and 28 percent black. Approximately 1,000 Asian Americans live in the area.


""They started shoving Loo and his friends around, making slurs at them in reference to Vietnamese people,"" Stinson said. The white men said they did not like Vietnamese and that they had lost a brother in the Vietnam War.


The management of the pool hall ordered the Piches to leave. When Loo's group of about six left the pool hall 15 minutes later, the Piches were waiting outside and continued their shoving and insults, said Stinson.


The Piches hit an Asian American in Loo's group with the shaft of a shotgun. When the gun fell on the ground and was damaged, the brothers brought out more weapons from their car, including a 22-calibre long rifle and a semi-automatic pistol, continued Stinson. One of the brothers swung the pistol at one of Loo's friends. The blow landed on the back of Loo's head, knocking him face-down onto the ground.


Broken beer bottles on the ground left a 1.5-inch cut on Loo's forehead. But he died two days later, on July 31, in the hospital, ""as a result of the swelling and bleeding of the brain from the wound at the back of his head,"" said Stinson.


Both of the Piche brothers, ages 36 and 29, who reported their address as ""anywhere,"" have been charged with first-degree murder, and are being held without bail, said Stinson.


Yuan Pei Chiou, owner of the Empress of China Restaurant and who employed Loo as a waiter for the last three years, said the Chinese American community is outraged over the incident and is ""fearful of another Vincent Chin case.""


Jane Shih, spokeswoman for the 200-member Triangle Area Chinese American Association, said the group is trying to help pay Loo's hospital bills, because he did not have medical insurance. ""We will be meeting to decide on a good lawyer and to determine the best way of bringing a lawsuit.""


Loo is survived by his parents, who own a small Chinese food take-out business in Virginia, said Chiou.


""Ming Hai was a very good kid, not the type that would stay out late and get into trouble. He had worked hard to save money for college and had registered to start school at the North Carolina State University this fall. I am very sad about this incident and want to see that justice is served,"" said Chiou in Chinese, speaking for Loo's family.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The ancient Chinese proverb of a thousand mile journey beginning with a single step has a special significance for Dr. Leland Yee.


The newest member of San Francisco's Board of Education began his campaign three years ago. After an unsuccessful first bid, he finally won a seat on the board. ""I hope this won't be the last time I will be sworn in,"" political newcomer Yee said during his installation ceremony at San Francisco Chinatown's Commodore Stockton Elementary School Auditorium on January 7.


Yee, an Oakland child psychologist, placed third with more than 15 percent (91,185 votes) in a herd of 11 candidates who ran for four seats on the board. (See Asian Week, 11/11/88).


A mini-Rainbow Coalition of over 300 Asian Americans, whites and blacks, watched Yee take his oath of office, which was administered by San Francisco Municipal Court Judge Lillian Sing. Sing had written the oath especially for Yee because ""Dr. Yee is so special and this is a special event.""


Among the key provisions of the oath were, ""to do equal right to the poor and to the rich; to serve the educational needs of all the children of San Francisco and in doing so to be sensitive to the different cultural, racial, religious, sexual and ethnic makeup of the children; to be always mindful of the community in which you were raised and nurtured -- a community which blends the goals of the educational mission with the cultural diversity of this City.""


Commissioner Yee's installation ceremony reflected the diversity of the city he will serve during his first four-year term as well as the broad support that he has earned from Asian Americans, blacks, whites, women and others. The pledge of allegiance was led by Commodore Stockton's Student Council which consisted of all Asian American students. The West Portal Elementary School Chinese Immersion Program Choir of Asian, white and black children sang several songs in Chinese. They learn their subjects in both English and Chinese in order to be completely bilingual. The predominantly black Touch of Class Choir of Phillip and Sala Burton Academic High School sang several gospel songs. The Benjamin Franklin Middle School Ensemble performed several classical musical numbers during the post ceremony reception.


Non-Asian members in the audience quickly became aware that this occasion would be very different when firecrackers and the Chung Ngai Dance Troupe Lion Dancers started the proceedings with their usual flair.


Stephen Louie, who co-hosted the event with Yee campaign treasurer Jack Colbert, introduced various members of the Chinese Six Companies.


Rev. Tim Dupree, executive director of the Booker T. Washington Community Center, welcomed the crowd. ""Welcome means 'to receive gladly and promote gladness.' San Francisco brought gladness to Leland Yee in November 1988 when he won his seat on the school board.""


The growing clout of Asian Americans was discreetly recognized by the presence of several key players in mainstream and community politics at Yee's inaugural. State Sen. Milton Marks, new S.F. Supervisor Terence Hallinan, former school board commissioner Ben Tom, attorney Steven Doi and Superintendent of Schools Ramon C. Cortines were among the key political players in attendance.


Although a separate inaugural ceremony for the entire school board was scheduled for Monday, Jan. 9, Judge Sing said that Yee's ceremony last Saturday was legal since she administered and signed the oath which would be recorded effective as of that date. According to Sing, other members had separate installation ceremonies as well. The purpose of the Monday ceremony is to introduce the entire school board to San Francisco.'


In his inaugural address, Yee gave ""thanks to teachers since we celebrate this occasion and your efforts to bring good education to our children. Also, thanks to Mom for her insistence on the importance of education in my life which resulted in a kid being able to rise from the playground to a seat on the school board.""


Yee also vowed to take more time for his children ""to ask them what they learned that day and what awes and frightens them.""


""I resolve to be more assertive and involved in the decision making process of the school board. I promise to rebuild ties with the community, to rebuild our school system, to educate, nurture and inspire our children who will lead us in the 21st Century,"" Yee continued.


""Don't forget to dream of the world that you want it to be,"" he urged his audience. ""As long as you dream, there will be good in this world.""

The Missing Presence


An appalling racist incident occurred on the Assembly floor on August 24. Assemblywoman Jackie Speier's ACR 37, which urged state and local districts to adopt only textbooks that accurately reflect the Japanese American internment as a violation of human rights motivated by racial prejudice, was being debated. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) took exception to this bill making reference to ""American Japs"" in his argument.


This is not the first incident in which Ferguson, a retired Marine Lt. Col., has made racist remarks against Japanese Americans: Two years ago, Senator Art Torres sponsored a non-controversial bill requesting funds for the Japanese American National Museum. Ferguson opposed the measure reminding the members of the ""attack on Pearl Harbor."" Assembly Dick Floyd (D-Gardena) quickly rose to rebut Ferguson's racist innuendo and labeled Ferguson ""Rambo.""


Only three months ago, Assemblyman Elihu Harris (D-Oakland) got into an altercation with Ferguson over Ferguson's attempt to justify the right of private clubs to discriminate on the basis of sex or race. In the heat of the debate, Harris called Ferguson a ""racist."" These were harsh words between colleagues in the legislative arena where it is rare for members to publicly chastise another member's character. But Harris' emotional outburst verbalized the anguish and frustration long felt by the Asian Pacific community towards Ferguson, who as a state representative, has consistently expressed racist comments about Japanese Americans.


Ferguson has been publicly censured for his views by other fellow assemblymembers such as Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles), Peter Chacon (D-San Diego) and John Burton (D-San Francisco). Ferguson has also received letters of admonishment from the community.


Most recently, Arnold Wensinger, a senate fellow and conservative Republican, wrote "".... after having listened to the floor discussion and taking into consideration that you are both a representative of the Republican party and thought to be a conservative, you make me ashamed to be affiliated with either label. I was astounded and disgusted that you had used a racial slur ""American Japs' to describe people of Japanese heritage... at the very least you appear to be a bigot and as a state leader, you sanction such behavior.""


Past National Japanese American Citizens League President Jerry Enomoto wrote "".... your use of the word 'Jap' is offensive and reflects an inexcusable ignorance that Japanese Americans have long regarded 'Jap' as a racial epithet.""


But, despite the letters and censure from fellow members, Ferguson has made no public apology and expresses no change in attitude. Thus, the question raised in a letter by Curtis Namba of Sacramento, strikes the core of the problem that has limited Asian Pacific political empowerment in state politics. Namba's letter asked ""Is Assemblyman Ferguson's bigoted remarks toward Japanese Americans a product of our lack of representation?"" In other words, would Assemblyman Ferguson have felt as free to use the racial slur 'American Japs' if Paul Bannai and Floyd Mori were still members of the Assembly? I think not.


In my 15 years of experience in the state Capitol, I do not recall one single incident when a racist remark was publicly made during a floor session against any other major ethnic group, specifically, the blacks or Hispanics. I have to assume that the mere presence of representatives from these specific communities causes members to be sensitive to the cultures, history and discrimination experienced by these ethnic groups.


Senator Roberti's Office of Asian Pacific Islander Affairs has attempted to fill some of the void of Asian Pacific representation in the state legislature during the past decade. But, staffers no matter how experienced or knowledgeable, are not elected members. Until there are elected Asian Pacific representatives in the state legislature. Asian Pacifics will never be full or equal players. The inside game of politics relies on relationships, compromises and exchanges of favors.


These inside negotiations are how most of the major policy decisions are made. An illustration of this is the redress issue. There is serious doubt that the redress bill would have passed Congress had it not been for the clout of our Asian Pacific representatives in Congress. As it is, our representatives in Congress are still battling for the funding of the redress legislation.


Nationally, statistics show that the ratio of Asian Pacific elected officials to the Asian Pacific population is dismal at best. However, California is seeing a growing number of potential Asian Pacific candidates seeking elected offices at the local, state and federal levels. For example, Lon Hatamiya is seeking an Assembly seat in 1990; Kunio Uehara is running for the Alameda County assessor seat this year. Matthew ""Kip"" Fong is being groomed by the Republicans to run for Congress in Southern California. Vu Duc Vuong of San Francisco is the first Southeast Asian to express interest in running for Board of Supervisors. Sam Kiang has challenged Mayor Barry Hatch of Monterey Park in retaliation for Hatch's anti-Asian attitude and Charles Kim is seeking a seat on the Cerritos City Council.


According to our latest 1989 statistics, there are a total of 83 Asian Pacifics serving on boards of supervisors, city councils and school boards. These offices serve as excellent launching grounds for state and federal offices. Those who are most mentioned as viable candidates for higher office include: S.F. Supervisor Tom Hsieh, L.A. City Councilman. Mike Woo, who has already expressed interest in the L.A. mayor's office in 1992, Monterey Park City Councilwoman Judy Chu, Santa Barbara Supervisor Gloria Megina Ochoa, L.A. School Board member Warren Furutani, S.F. Community College board member Julie Tang and veteran Mas Fukai, mayor of Gardena.


The talent that is emerging within the Asian Pacific community is indeed encouraging. However, we still have a long way to go to reach parity. Hopefully, the day is coming soon when the ""missing presence"" becomes the ""visible presence"" of an ethnic group that is no longer content to be invisible in the state legislature.

Leni Marin is a Filipina, a lesbian and an administrator of a domestic violence project. Caryl Ito, formerly a social worker, is a businesswoman and a Japanese American community leader.


What do these women have in common?


Both women were appointed by Mayor Art Agnos to the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women. Both bring strong backgrounds of community activism.


Leni administers contracts for the Domestic Violence Project, a local program. The project's activities educate and motivate women to deal with family violence.


Through her leadership as president of the board of directors, the San Francisco Women's Building provides education, training and direct services to empower women, especially women of color.


Politically, Leni is helping develop the Lesbian Caucus of the Harvey Milk Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club. She conducts conference workshops, such as the ones recently sponsored by the Bay Area Lesbians of Color and Lesbian Agenda for Action on working in The City's structure.


Leni worked on the recent campaign to support The City's controversial Domestic Partners legislation (Proposition S) which the voters rejected by a 1 percent margin. She worked on voter education and registration in the Jesse Jackson campaigns in 1988 and 1984.


For most of her career, Caryl Ito was a Santa Clara County social worker addressing multi-cultural issues. Five years ago, she made a major career change. She became a sales and marketing representative for Bozeman and Associates, a Korean woman-owned educational toy company. She also owns a candy shop in Sacramento, Sweets and Company.


For over two decades, Caryl has been a community leader in addressing Asian American women's issues. She helped found and build the Pacific Asian American Women Bay Area Coalition, which has promoted, supported and developed Asian women of the Bay Area for close to a decade. She has also chaired its Statewide Network.


Outside the Asian community, Caryl has served on the American Cancer Society's State Advisory Committee on Special Populations; currently, she's a member of the board of directors of the Camp Fire Girls of Northern California.


On August 23, Mayor Agnos administered the oath of office to Leni, Caryl and five other women commissioners.


These women of diverse backgrounds were brought together to tackle sensitive issues as women in the workplace, women and family, women and health. Their mandate includes establishing policy in six areas: affirmative action, upward mobility, gender based discrimination, sexual harassment, domestic violence, and city departments' services to women in the community.


Leni was appointed president for a one-year term by the mayor. Caryl was appointed to chair the Domestic Violence Experts Panel, which recommends funding proposals addressing domestic violence, e.g., funding the Asian Women's Shelter.


Both Leni and Caryl expressed a strong desire to involve the community in the commission's work.


Leni emphasized that ""As a minority woman, I want to assure that the minority community gets involved in every aspect of the commission. It's my challenge.""


She plans to invite key community leaders to serve on committees. She envisions that these leaders will develop strategies to tackle issues and communicate how these issues impact their communities.


Caryl feels that Asian women must get involved in defining their own problems. She wants Asian women to attend public meetings and to comment on relevant issues. She feels it's her responsibility to find Asian women to volunteer on the commission's various advisory panels.


Leni regards the commission as a vehicle to involve the community. She feels that the commission is accountable to all women of San Francisco.


The old commission was criticized as ineffectual. It was regarded as administratively hidden, with too little staff and too small a budget. Its few products were criticized. As an example, one affirmative action specialist asserts that its comparable worth brochure had misleading assertions that caused more harm than good.


To respond to such criticism, Mayor Agnos had a task force recommend changes. The new commission is now independent, staffed, funded and with powerful people involved. The mayor has given his personal backing to these changes.


This new commission has created hopeful expectations. As Grace Ong Hing, chair of PAAWBAC commented, ""PAAWBAC is looking forward to working closely with the new commission and is pleased with the restructuring of this very important body.""


However, there are skeptics on the sidelines. An Asian American community leader cautioned, ""let's wait and see.""


The mayor has given the commission new life. He's given it new leadership through Leni, Caryl and the five other members.


These leaders represent diverse lifestyles and understandings; they must cooperate to define issues for the protection, equal treatment and economic equity of women.

WASHINGTON -- President George Bush has named Elaine Chao deputy secretary of transportation, the highest office ever reached by an Asian American in the executive branch of the United States government.


Chao, 35, has enjoyed a rapid rise in Washington, having previously served in the Transportation Department under Elizabeth Dole and most recently serving as chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission. If she wins Senate confirmation for the $89,500-per-year position, she will oversee 100,000 employees in a department with a $29 billion budget.


Chao earned her MBA from Harvard. A former White House Fellow, she served as a vice president of BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco and with Citicorp in New York.


Dr. John Tsu, a member of Bush's transition team, said that ""there is overall joy in the Asian American community, because this is just the beginning of Asians being appointed to policy-making positions.""


Dr. Allan Seid, president of Asian Pacific American Advocates U.S.A., said he was ""delighted.""


""It's a really good first step for President Bush's administration. I certainly have the expectation that the Bush administration will be more open than the previous one to including persons of diverse ethnic backgrounds,"" said Seid.


""I think George Bush really takes care of Asians, especially women,"" said Florence Fang of San Francisco. ""That's why he always asked his aides, 'Where are our minorities? Where are our women?' I'm so happy for Elaine Chao and for the Asian community.""


Franklin Chow, a lobbyist for the Organization of Chinese Americans in Washington, D.C., said Chao's rapid rise was a good omen. ""I think she's being groomed for bigger things.""


Irvin Lai, national president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, echoed that theme. ""I realize we aren't far enough along yet to have an Asian secretary of defense or other full cabinet member, but at least now we have an Asian at the Number 2 spot.""


Henry Yee of Orange County said the appointment was a fulfillment of Bush's pledge to appoint Asians to policy-making positions. ""I believe this is a big step forward, and I hope there are many more. We Asians have tremendous talent to offer.""


Dr. David Lam, head of the Asian American Manufacturers Association, said he hoped Chao's would ""signal the beginning"" of many Asians' entry to mainstream politics. ""This is definitely not the peak -- we have a long way to go.""


One position that might be filled by an Asian -- astronaut Taylor Wang's name has been bandied about -- is that of national science advisor.


Tsu defended the slowness of the appointment process, saying Bush was distracted by the controversy over John Tower's appointment as secretary of defense. He said Asians are being considered for appointment to Housing & Urban Development, Health & Human Services, Education, Labor, the Veteran's Administration' and personnel management.

Dr. Eri F. Yasuhara, associate professor of Japanese and co-director of the center, will be the project director.


The award was made to the California State University to help enhance the teaching of Japanese at educational institutions throughout the state. Funding of $99,000 has been provided for a six-month period to run a series of in-service workshops for Japanese teachers and to develop curriculum materials. The project hopes to increase Japanese language studies through the use of new approaches and methodologies at a time when the importance of Japan as a world power is growing.


Yasuhara will direct the project with the assistance of Dr. Toshiko Mishima at SFSU and Professor Yoko Pusavat at Cal State, Long Beach, as associate directors. Two major Japanese teachers' organizations in California will also collaborate as well as other CSU campuses. Systemwide aspects of the program will be coordinated by the CSU Institute for Teaching and Learning with Dr. Helen Roberts as director.


According to Yasuhara, ""the highlight of the project will be a five-day workshop for 30 participants, to be held in conjunction with the CFLTASDE Summer Seminar for Foreign Language Teachers in August. This seminar will be followed by a series of one-day workshops in both Northern and Southern California. Although high school teachers of Japanese have been specifically targeted, teachers at the college level will also be eligible to participate.

OAKLAND -- Leaders of the Task Force on Asian American University Admissions buried the hatchet with 'UC Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman last week, citing the need to move forward rather than dwell on injustices of the past.


Judges Lillian Sing and Ken Kawaichi invited members of the press to their joint ""celebration"" with Heyman of ""the full participation of Asian Americans in all campus affairs."" The party was held at Oakland's Emperor Restaurant, overlooking scenic Jack London Square and was attended by Ling-chi Wang, a Berkeley professor, and Henry Der, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, both of who have been vocal critics of the university's admissions policies.


The task force led the fight against policies instituted in 1983 and 1984 which made it harder for Asian Americans to gain admission to the prestigious university.


A recent faculty senate study confirmed that these policies had a disproportionate impact on Asian Americans. Most of the policies have since been dropped.


But that study indicated that 238 Asian American students were unjustly denied admission to the Berkeley campus of the University of California.


Asian American students have demanded that the administrators responsible for instituting the discriminatory policies be identified and fired.


Heyman apologized for the policies' impact on the Asian American students denied admission, but he refused to identify the administrators responsible for the policies.


And Sing denied that the task force had ever requested that the administrators be disciplined.


Kawaichi, who is a judge on the Alameda County Superior Court bench, said on one hand that the evidence against the administrators was conclusive. But he later called the evidence ""circumstantial"" and said discriminatory intent would probably be ""impossible"" to prove.


Ron Takaki, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Berkeley, disputed the task force's decision to drop all claims. He suggested that a private agreement had been reached between Sing, Kawaichi and Heyman.


""The thing about affirmative action is that you don't have to prove discriminatory intent, just discriminatory effect,"" Takaki said.


""I think we need some justice here,"" he added. ""I think individuals should be held accountable for discriminatory policies. I think they should pay the price for those policies. This had a very major impact on the lives of more than 200 people.""


But Kawaichi was more concerned with changing the policies, not seeking restitution for their victims.


""If you fire one, two or three people but the policy remains the same, then (discrimination) can recur. But with the policy changed, it will not recur."" Kawaichi said.


Language Requirements


Administrator Patrick Hayashi said the university will attempt to allow for consideration of fluency in Asian languages to fulfill foreign language requirements for admission. Currently only European languages are accepted.


While waiting for the College Board to develop standards and tests of Asian language capabilities, the campus will develop its own Asian language certification system within the next two or three years, Hayashi vowed.


The campus will also ""petition the statewide system"" to include a line on the student application form indicating whether the applicant has attended high school in a foreign country and, if so, at what grade level.


The academic senate will also consider restoring Caucasian and Asian American students to the Equal Opportunity Program for special admissions.


In response to demands that more Asian Americans be appointed to policy-making positions at the university, Heyman refused to make any commitment other than to instruct search committees to maintain ""sensitivity to the needs of all groups that are under-represented"" in the administration.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Businessman George Okamoto will be one of the four recipients of community awards at the Japanese Cultural and Community Center of Northern California's fourth annual awards dinner on Saturday, August 19, at 6 p.m. at the Hyatt on Union Square in San Francisco. Okamoto is the president of Nomura and Company which produces Kokuho Rose Rice.


""I got involved with the community center through my cousin Takeo Okamoto,"" states Okamoto. ""I have donated a lot of money to the center because I think it is a vital part of our community. It is important to have a center which can bring our community together.""


A native of San Francisco, Okamoto grew up in Japantown. He received his formal education in Sacramento. During World War II, Okamoto was interned at the Tule Lake and Topaz camps. He attended Sacramento Junior College and later received a business administration degree from Golden Gate University.


In 1946 Okamoto began a business partnership with Nomura, his son Ray and Y. Tsumori. They began making sake but discovered the business was not prospering. Through Tsumori's connections, they ventured into the rice business. In 1956 the corporation became a family business.


""Mr. Nomura and Mr. Tsumori have both passed away and Ray is now retired,"" said Okamoto. ""I am the only one left. My wife and my son George Jr. and his wife all work with me in the rice business. Only my daughter, Cathy, is not here. She is a pharmacist. When I retire, the business will be passed on to my son."" Okamoto's business has succeeded. The company sells 10 million sacks of rice a year. Ninety percent of his customers are Koreans. He said Koreans like the taste of his rice.


""I think people like the flavor of our rice,"" he said. ""They also like the moisture and physical appearance. It takes a lifetime to develop a new grain of rice. We do testing of the rice here in our office in Burlingame. We sell our rice all over the United States. My dream is to be able to sell rice to Japan. Maybe in a couple of years the trade barriers will not be so hard.""


Okamoto is well known in San Francisco's Nikkei community. His company donates the rice for the Kimochi nutrition program. He is also the past president of the Nikkei Lions Club, past director of JCCCNC, major gifts committee member of the JCCCNC Capital Campaign, past scoutmaster of Troop 12 and a member of the Rice Millers Association, the JACL and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.


Among the many honors he has received are the Kimochi award for sensitivity and support, Korean awards from the Korean Multi-Service Center, an award from the Korean Community of the East Bay, and he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Republican Task Force.


In his office there is a plaque written in Japanese which he received from the late Emperor Hirohito many years ago.


JCCCNC will also present awards to Ruth Asawa, Kazuyoshi Miyazaki, Chizu Iiyama, Jeffrey K. Mori and Ben Takeshita. Cost of the dinner is $60 per person.


For further information or reservations call the JCCCNC office at (415) 567-5505.

PALO ALTO -- At the Chinese Film Festival in Palo Alto recently, the works of filmmaker Arthur Dong were showcased before over 300 enthusiastic movie fans. His prize-winning ""Sewing Woman"" and ""Lotus"" prefaced a lively ""in the flesh"" show of former Forbidden City Nightclub entertainers of yesteryear. Celebrated owner of the first Chinese nightclub in San Francisco, Charlie Low, 88 years strong, introduced his former stars, dancer Paul Jew Wing, singer Larry Ching and songstress Frances Chun (Kan).


Staged at the Lucie Stern Theater, the film festival was sponsored by the Chinese Community Center of the Peninsula and the Palo Alto Recreation Department in celebration of Chinese New Year. The impetus behind the festival and Forbidden City entertainers reunion comes from Dong, who is now at work on ""Forbidden City, U.S.A.,"" a documentary.


Dong was expected to introduce his movies at the fest, but had just returned from Beijing the day before, suffering from pneu-monia. He had prepared clips of his preliminary work on the new film of the nightclub which was enjoyed and cheered by former fans of that scene of the 1940s to 1960s. His sister and co-writer, Lorraine Dong, spoke on her brother's behalf, explaining that his films are all non-profit ventures and thus he is in need of funds to carry on his new project. His 1983 documentary, ""Sewing Woman,"" a story based on his own mother, was nominated for an Academy Award.


As Charlie Low reminisced, ""I had an all-Oriental show and I had a good one. I have pictures of many big stars of Hollywood who came to my place."" The Forbidden City film clips included a picture of Ronald Reagan in military uniform gazing across the table at then-wife Jane Wyman.


Low . . . as he introduced former stars from his club. Larry Ching, who was often called the Chinese Frank Sinatra of that day, enthralled an excited audience with his clear renditions of ""Begin the Beguine"" and the ""Hawaiian Wedding Song."" He dedicated ""Because of You"" to a Chinese Community Center of the Peninsula former president and stalwart leader, Lorraine Gee.


Paul Wing, who used to be part of a dance team entertaining under the aegis of Toy and Wing, is a Palo Alto native and still as spunky in dance and tongue as he once was when he performed on the Orpheum circuit throughout the United States and Europe. ""My father didn't approve of my dancing when I began on a Palo Alto street corner in the 1920s. He wanted me as the oldest son to go to Stanford to become someone in the world."" After winning numerous Charleston contests at the Palo Alto Stanford Theater, Wing went on the road, eventually returning to San Francisco to perform at the Forbidden City.


Frances Chun Kan, who was accompanied by former Cathayan Band colleague David Sum, recalled and performed some of the most requested songs of the 1940s when she was appearing at the Forbidden City. Her voice still captivated the audience when she sang old favorites ""Embraceable You,"" ""It Had To Be You"" and ""I Wish You Love."" Frances, 69, recalled, ""Our club was a very nice family type of club, a very 'in' place to go. It was strictly classy and nothing shady ever went on there.""


Larry Ching, 68, was always the popular favorite singing big band hits on the Forbidden City stage. He says of that time, ""I thought people came to the club just because we were Chinese. I never liked being compard to Frank Sinatra because I felt I didn't sing anywhere close to him. I wanted to be myself."" Ching quit show business in the '50s, but showed the fest audience his voice is still pure and strong.


By the early 1960s, the novelty of all-Asian revues began to wane as the popularity of nightclub floor shows slid in general. In 1963 Low sold his club and the Forbidden City location is now an office building. ""Oriental talent was as scarce as hen's teeth. It was a struggle to hire Chinese girls for the chorus line where they would have to show their legs. They had trouble, coming from traditional Chinese homes teaching modesty, exposing their bodies in public with our skimpy costumes. We had revues called 'Chinese Follies on Parade featuring the Wongettes' and 'Chinese Version of a Latin Fiesta.'""


In the 1940s, doorman F. Huie recalls the wartime boom with most evenings seeing four deep at the bar. The club became an Asian version of Harlem's Cotton Club, a place hung with tapestries and clouded by incense, where white customers thronged to see Chinese performers who were traditionally stereotyped as only cooks and laundry workers.


Arthur Dong hopes to capture the magic and glamour of this forgotten chapter of entertainment history in an hour-long documentary film. Those past stars, ""the Chinese Fred Astaire, Chinese Sally Rand and Chinese Sophie Tucker"" are just some of the players who will share triumphant and sometimes humorous tales of those difficult attempts to break into show business at a time when Asian Americans were best relegated to their laundries.


""Forbidden City, U.S.A."" will be produced and directed by Arthur Dong. Director of photography will be Michael Chin with sound by Curtis Choy. Over half of the projected $225,000 budget for the film has been raised through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Brody Arts Fund, the Chinese Community Center of the Peninsula, the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation and many others. Dong is still short $100,000 and is asking former Forbidden City admirers to help.


Tax-deductible donations can be sent to Film Arts Foundation, 346 9th St., 2nd floor, S.F., CA 94103. For more information, contact Arthur Dong, Deep Focus Productions, 1737 No. Orange Grove Ave., L.A., CA 90046.

PALO ALTO -- San Francisco businessman Walter Shorenstein this week pledged $1 million to Stanford University in support of its Asian studies programs.


The Shorenstein gift will be used to expand four existing Stanford Asian studies programs including: the Center for East Asian Studies, Project of Peace and Cooperation in the Asian Pacific Region, the United States Japan Legislators Conference and the Korean Studies Program.


According to Stanford President Donald Kennedy, Shorenstein's generous gift will not only make the Asian studies program at the university one of the finest in the United States, it will also assist in advancing the Bay Area's position as a leader in Pacific Rim education research and policy making.


Shorenstein said he made the contribution to help promote the Bay Area as the most important educational, intellectual, research and cultural center in the U.S. concerned with Asia and the Pacific.


""The academic world can be a catalyst that stimulates the entire community,"" he said. ""Universities have the brain power and the curiosity to analyze issues and to point the way in order to bring diverse forces together.""


The Center for East Asian Studies oversees and coordinates Stanford's teaching and research programs dealing with China, Japan and Korea. It is aided by more than 30 full-time faculty members and the resources of Stanford's East Asian library collection. It's funded by the U.S. Department of Education as a designated National Resource Center.


A high priority of the center's use of the Shorenstein funding will be to strengthen teaching and research in the contemporary Chinese economy and facilitate faculty appointments in this area. Funds will also be devoted to major international conferences, support for visiting scholarships, expanded faculty research and offer a broad range of fellowships.


Project of Peace and Cooperation in the Asian Pacific Region pools resources form Stanford scholars and academic specialists in the Soviet Union, China, Japan and Korea, who meet to examine policies and actions that could reduce tensions and enhance cooperation and peaceful development among the nations in Northeast Asia.


The collaboration among the scholars has resulted in a number of important initiatives. Two years ago Soviet scholars at Stanford came up with a program for strengthening security and reducing the risk of war in the Asian Pacific region. Another document authored by the groups outlined risk reduction and confidence building measures that could be taken in the same area.


More recent meetings between the scholars resulted in a document on strengthening security and developing cooperation on the Korean peninsula.


The United States Japan Legislators conference serves as the organizing committee for a leading group of legislators from Congress and the Japanese Diet. The group convenes annually to discuss issues of interest to both countries and to make practical policy recommendations that members can implement through their legislative bodies.

LOS ANGELES -- The Filipino American actress auditioning for the role of a prosecuting attorney had been told that she was coming on too strong in her reading. ""Just tone it down a little, and it would be perfect,"" she was told, she said.


But instead, she stood up and yelled: ""I object, your honor!"" startling her audience.


""I was taking a chance,"" she told Asian Week in an interview. ""I only had two minutes to make an impression,"" and persisting in playing the role her way fit in better with portraying a headstrong attorney.


And taking that risk had paid off for Iilana B'Tiste, because she now appears regularly in ""Trial By Jury,"" a new nationally syndicated series from Dick Clark Productions.


The actress, who played a Vietnamese prostitute in a recent episode of ""Tour of Duty,"" said she is relieved she does not have to ""wear something sexy and speak broken English"" in the new show.


It has been her goal to play someone powerful, someone who is more likely to, instead, wear a three-piece suit and carry a briefcase, and ""is able to speak for people who can't speak for themselves,"" she said.


But she has had to work hard to attain that goal. Born and raised in Vallejo, California, B'Tiste knew that she wanted to be an actress about 10 years ago, while in her early '20s.


Since then she labored in acting and drama classes while supporting herself through a career in . . .


To make he dreams come true, five years go she left her ""close-knit"" family in the Bay Area for the opportunities in the Southland.


""I was calling home every two hours. My mother kept asking: ""When are you going to come home?"" The actress who has since co-starred in a recent feature film ""The Iron Triangle,"" recalled the difficult times.


As it would be with most Asian American parents, she had a hard time convincing her parents to accept her career ambition, she said. But now her mother is thrilled to see her on television as an attorney -- ""They've always wanted me to be a lawyer.""


Although she enjoys the role of a powerful prosecutor, sometimes, as the lone woman among actors who have played the judge, defending attorney and other court personnel, ""deep down inside I feel intimidated,"" she said.


""Of course, I was supposed to,"" she added -- not many Asian women have been in positions of power.


Nevertheless, she has turned some of her disadvantages into strength. She is making good use of the frustration and anger that have accumulated during her years as a minority actress, she said, recounting how her blond-hair and blue-eyed friend who went auditioning with her often got the jobs they both wanted.


""There was a lot of anger that can come out and work for me,"" she added.


When she opened her mouth arguing for her case in court, she said, she generated her forcefulness from thinking: ""Hear me, see me differently, I am not a stereotype (Asian woman), I can defend myself and my client. I've made it, I'm on an equal footing with you, you can't push me around anymore!""


And the other Asian women who were on the crew as extras would come up to cheer her on saying: ""Oh, you are doing so good!"" Other women of color, like Hispanics and blacks, are also supportive of her, she said. ""There is a bonding there.""


And how she came across as the prosecuting attorney counts, because a jury panel actually cast their ballots on the verdict based on two sides' performance, B'Tiste pointed out.


""Trial By Jury"" is aired on Channel 13 about once a week, usually at 12:30 a.m.

SANTA CLARA -- Each year in Santa Clara County the Constitutional Rights Foundation of California, a part of the State Department of Education Project, holds a Mock Trial Competition at the Superior Court building. The event is cosponsored by the State Bar of California, the California Young Lawyers Association and the Los Angeles Daily Journal.


According to the Constitutional Rights Foundation, the goals of the event include: 1) furthering student understanding of the substance of the law as applied by our courts and the legal system; 2) increased proficiency in basic skills such as listening, speaking, reading and reasoning; 3) promoting cooperation and healthy competition among students of various abilities and interests; and 4) demonstrating high school students' achievements to the community.


During the mock trial, judges and lawyers in the community volunteer their time to listen to students enact court cases where they play the roles of prosecuting and defense attorneys, witnesses and court clerks/bailiffs.


For every case, there are two lawyers and one judge who rate the efforts of the students as a team representing their school and the team with the highest scores wins.


Judge James Chang, a Gov. Deukmejian appointee with the Santa Clara Municipal Court, and one of the volunteer judges, observed that this year there were many more Asians who entered the competition. This may be indicative of the fact that more Asian students are taking an interest in law and government.


""Previously,"" Chang said, ""Asian students tended to head toward math, science and engineering majors in college.""


In observing the different students participating in the mock trial competition, Judge Chang said that Amy Lin, a senior from Pioneer High School in San Jose, was superb in her role as prosecuting attorney.


Lin herself confided with a giggle that she had enjoyed playing the part because she liked to ""hang"" people, meaning that she believes that the guilty should get what they deserve.


Lin noted that this was her second year participating in the competition. She enjoyed it so much the first time that she wanted to do it again this year. Lin and the members of her team from Pioneer High School had been training for the competition since last November under the guidance of coaches, who included two lawyers, a teacher and a parent.


""During the two-week competition, our team had a chance to enact a case four times, twice as prosecution and twice as the defense,"" said Lin. ""Both sides spent time examining and cross-examining the defendant and witnesses and we were scored for the effectiveness of our argument, our ability to speak and how poised we were.""


Lin hopes to first obtain an accounting degree in college and then a law degree. She mentioned that students participating in the competition were not all interested in being lawyers.


""One person I know,"" said Lin, ""is planning to be an actress and the mock trial competition was a great opportunity for her to test her acting skills. Most of the student participants enjoy public speaking and role playing.""

LOS ALTOS HILLS -- There has been such a demand for horticulture experts in growing communities in the South Bay that community institutions like College of San Mateo at San Mateo, Foothill College at Los Altos Hills and Ilone College at Fremont have been offering courses to train students in this field of work. Students can obtain an associate of science degree in the major. The program is under the biological and health sciences division of the college.


George Masamori, a part-time teacher at Foothill College, said that ""horticulture is a generic term which covers a wide range and includes floriculture and lanscaping."" At Foothill students in the ornamental horticulture major can specialize in landscape or nursery management.


Curriculum requirements include such courses as horticulture skills, landscape construction and installation, spring, fall, and winter plant materials, landscape horticultural practices, landscape design, nursery practices and commercial plant production, plant diseases and many other vital subjects.


One of the important classes Masamori teaches is turf management, which goes into turf identification and planting techniques for such places as golf courses, athletic fields, parks, areas surrounding commercial buildings and private residences.


He also teaches a class on turf irrigation design, which deals with the principles of design and layout of irrigation systems.


Masamori noted that the field of horticulture is very interesting and learning can go into infinity. However, work availability depends on economics. ""If the economy is good, then there is more work,"" he said, ""but if the economy slows down, the tendency is for landscape and landscape maintenance to have a less vital role for homeowners and businesses.""


Masamori was supervisor of parks for the city of Sunnyvale until March, when he was prmoted to superintendent of buildings and facilities.


He began teaching part-time at Foothill College ""by accident."" He had taken classes at the college in the 1970s when an opportunity presented itself for him to teach a course in landscape maintenance and construction equipment, including heavy duty equipment like tractors.


""It was easy for me to teach the course, since I had been in the field for over 30 years,"" he says.


Masamori really enjoys teaching and he encourages his students to come back to him at any time when they need consultation. Many of his students are home gardeners who want to learn enough to design and plant their own gardens. Others are professionals working in the field (literally) who need additional information to better perform on their job.

The Tiananmen Square inciden. has -- if nothing else -- seemed to bring a new unity to the Chinese American community and over-turned previously held assumptions.


Those who used to be the most vocal supporters of the People's Republic of China are now standing at the forefront of the protests against the Beijing regime. And the conservative, pro-Taiwan organizations have been slow to respond.


In San Francisco, for instance, where the Chinese Consolidate Benevolent Association has an affiliated group known as the Anti-Communist League, the CCBA has made almost no response to the events in China. The group ordinarily could have been expected to seize the opportunity for propaganda, but observers suspect its silence is dictated by the hands-off stance publicly taken by Taiwan in the first days following the June 4 massacre.


The outcry in the Chinese American community has also had a strong impact on journalism. The China Daily News in New York broke from the Beijing regime, ending a relationship it has held with the communists since it was founded in 1940.


And the publisher of Centre Daily News, a left-leaning daily newspaper, was forced to resign as publisher and editor following outrage over his hardline position against Chinese student demonstrators. Readers had responded by demanding that advertisers boycott the paper, resulting in a sudden drop in revenues.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Two well-known Chinatown ministers were arrested Monday in front of the Federal Building after joining a rally to mourn the killings of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador.


Reverends Harry Chuck and Norman Fong of Cameron House were among the 136 people, mostly priests, who were detained by the police after the demonstration against the U.S. involvement in the Central American country.


""When the people who are doing good are killed, it makes no sense... it just seems so incongruent,"" said Rev. Chuck.


""This is something that pricks the conscience and it certainly pricks my conscience,"" he added. ""The killings really drove things home.""


Chuck and Fong knelt with the other priests on the steps of the entrance to the federal building and joined them in song and prayer. The police came out and told them to move back, but the priests refused and were arrested.


""We need to get the government to be more aware of what's going on,"" said Fong.


Chuck said the demonstration was well organized and orderly. After they were arrested, he added, ""we were treated well and the police were courteous."" Rev. Fong added that over 100 clergy and theological students from the Bay Area, along with about 500 other people, took part in the protest.


Both ministers were held in a cell with close to 50 other demonstrators, mainly priests, and that gave Chuck a feeling of ""solidarity with other clergy.""


""Our spirits were high, and when other people who had been arrested came through the door, everyone clapped,"" he said, ""and we also sang.""


The two ministers, held for about five hours in the federal prison, were released at four o'clock in the afternoon. They were given citations for disturbance and now have the the option of either paying a $25 fine or going to court.


The rally was part of a larger nationwide prayer ceremony for the latest deaths in El Salvador and to protest U.S. aid to the Central American country.

VANCOUVER, B.C. -- Anti-Asian feelings are beginning to surface in British Columbia, according to a recent report in the Chicago Tribune.


For the last decade Vancouver has aggressively courted Asian investors. But because of the highly visible influx of wealthy Hong Kong immigrants who are buying up large portions of the city's downtown area, native residents have pushed for harsh new restrictions.


In a city where every third resident is now foreign-born, prominent politicians including the former mayor and a British Columbia Supreme Court justice are unabashedly warning that Canadians of European stock could soon become the ""new minority"" in Canada.


According to Philip Barter, a leading analyst of Asian investment and senior partner at Price Waterhouse, white business elite are turning ""alarmingly elitist.""


""Once again we are being reminded that we don't belong here,"" said attorney Bill Yee, who immigrated from Hong Kong 30 years ago and served on the Vancouver City Council in 1982 as the city's first Chinese Canadian alderman. ""We have been fighting this bloody thing for years.""


In Vancouver, Chinese Canadians account for 8 percent of the metropolitan area's population of 1.4, million. Many of these residents have lived in the area for generations and trace their lineage to the Chinese peasants who helped build the Canadian Pacific Railway.


Chinese were forced to pay an expensive ""head tax"" until the 1920s and were barred, from entering Canada from 1923 until 1947. They were subject to less overt forms of official discrimination until 1967.


More recently the tables have turned with the advent of Hong Kong immigrants' financial clout. But the initial embrace is beginning to cool off. Records show that from 1987 to 1988 foreign entrepreneurs with a net of $1.1 billion settled in British Columbia. About 60 percent of the residents are Asian, and the Hong Kong investors among them are buying an estimated $400 million worth of provincial real estate annually.


The most renowned investor in Vancouver is Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, who last year bought the site of the 1986 World's Fair for $260 million. This 203-acre site is one-sixth of downtown Vancouver.


The Hong Kong immigrants are now being blamed for the high housing prices, property taxes and cash crisis in public schools, since money is needed to teach English to the immigrant children.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Senator Paul Simon and Representative Nancy Pelosi met with Asian American leaders in Chinatown last week to tout the benefits of Simon's immigration reform legislation.


The legislation, introduced earlier this year, is designed to maintain current eligibility criteria for immigrants seeking to enter the U.S. under family preference categories and increase the ceiling on visas under those categories from the current 216,000 to 336,000.


In addition, the Simon bill would reduce the waiting period for permanent residents from five to three years before they can apply for naturalization.


The bill is one of two proposals before the Senate on immigration reform. Rep Howard Berman has a family reunification proposal before the House as well.


Simon said showing support for his bill is important, especially in light of a competing proposal authored by Senator Ted Kennedy.


Kennedy's proposal which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate last year, stalled in the House.


The Kennedy bill would reduce the fifth preference category, which is most frequently used by Asians -- 67 percent -- and restrict future eligibility to unmarried brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens.


Pelosi called the Kennedy legislation, which tends to favor immigrants from Ireland, ""short-sighted.""


She added that bringing more Irish people into America is a worthy pursuit, but not at the expense of the Asians and Hispanics.


""It's one-sided and absolutely must not pass,"" said Pelosi of the Kennedy bill. ""The Simon bill must pass.""


Pelosi added that she is surprised in light of the legislation Kennedy is pushing, that the senator continues to be cheered by Hispanics and Asians.


Pelosi also plugged her support for the the Berman bill.


Simon said that most likely his bill will be reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee within the next eight weeks. Because of this time element, Simon urged Asian American supporters to move quickly on efforts to show Congress members they support his bill.


Simon suggested that community members contact California Sen. Pete Wilson and key senators in other states as well. Pelosi and Simon also emphasized that a letter writing campaign is an effective measure.


Simon said the legislation is one of 500 to 1,000 issues that the senators face, so its importance must be stressed.


""Most of them don't feel that strongly one way or another. But if they get 20 to 30 letters, they will pay attention,"" said Simon.


He suggested that immigration reform is not the most pressing issue on the minds of the senators.


""What you have to do is take it from the back burner to the front,"" said Simon. He said this can be acheived by making important contacts and expressing concerns through letters to those in Congress.


Simon admitted that getting his bill or even a portion of it passed will be a tough feat. It is likely there will be amendments and compromises.


""When it comes to the full judicial committee, there will be a series of amendments. If the bill emerges close to the Kennedy/Simpson bill, I'll have to oppose it,"" said Simon.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Providing all goes well, a non-profit Chinese American historical museum that will utilize lifelike wax figures will be opening its doors to the public soon, according to Thomas Fong, president of the proposed Chinese American Historical Museum.


Fong, owner of the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf and Movieland Wax Museum in the Los Angeles area, indicated that a search is now under way to find space in the Chinatown area for the museum that will require a minimum of 7,000 square feet.


Fong said finding a building that the museum could be incorporated into would be ideal, since construction from scratch would be costly. He's discussing the prospect of locating the museum in the Chinese Culture Center in the Holiday Inn on Kearny Street.


In addition to finding an appropriate location for the museum, Fong is searching for individuals and groups interested in making contributions to the project. He explained that $1 million will be needed for the design and fabrication of display areas, acquisition of collections and for operating expenses.


Once completed, the museum will document the contributions of Chinese pioneers who paved the way for the generations that followed. The museum will be designed to offer an accurate recreation of life and times, and the environment and atmosphere, experienced by the immigrants.


The museum will instill pride in the community for the advances Chinese Americans have made since immigrating to America, Fong hopes.


The museum is being created so that the story of the Chinese in America can be told in an interesting and accurate way, he said.


He said the museum will be much different than the Chinese wax museum once located at the corner of Grant and California in Chinatown. Fong complained that the former wax museum projected a bad impression of the Chinese by showing graphic war scenes and the smoking of opium -- details Fong said Chinese would prefer to forget.


He said the museum is being created so all people, no matter what their race or cultural background, can understand and appreciate the hardship Chinese endured. They will also be able to learn about the contributions Chinese immigrants have made.


As an immigrant to California over 50 years ago, Fong, now 76, said he understands the hardships new comers face in this country. He said he wants to share this experience through the medium of the museum.


""I went through this and know what the hardships are,"" said Fong of his experience as a newcomer to America.


The museum will start with a display of the first boatload of Chinese immigrants and follow with the trials and successes of the early pioneers. Displays will exhibit areas of special interest such as medicinal remedies and gambling games and equipment. Fong said the museum will also include today's leaders in the Chinese American community.


The major display areas will include an immigrant boat from China, the Angel Island immigration office, a gold rush camp, streets of San Francisco, railroads and farming, ethnic foods, celebrations and famous achievements by Chinese Americans.


Those interested in getting involved in the project are asked to contact Fong at (415) 885-4834.

I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but now that the national observance is out of the way, I believe it's time for us to recognize that Christopher Columbus was a thief.


I don't mean that he was a thief in the normal sense, although many Native Americans believe he stole their land. What I mean is that he made a mistake, and in the process stole the name ""Indian"" from its rightful owners and gave it to the natives of the New World.


As most of us learned in school, American Indians got that name because Columbus, searching for a westward route to India, landed in North American. Believing he had reached India, the explorer called the natives ""Indians."" Stubborn man that he was, he continued to do so even after he found out he hadn't reached India at all. And by that time, the name had taken hold in the European explorer fraternity.


Five hundred years later, the whole world continues to use the term ""Indian"" to describe those people who lived in the Americas long before Europeans even dreamed of sailing west.


Now, I know that to most Americans, Columbus' little mistake is just a tidbit of historical lore. I also know that for those Native Americans who were run off their land and massacred by European settlers, Columbus' real mistake was showing up on this continent in the first place.


In the face of that, my complaint may seem, well, trivial. And I suppose it can be viewed that way. But that's the nature of pet peeves, isn't it?


When I was in grade school, kids used to ask ""What are you?"" I always found this a difficult question. Were they asking me if I was a human? Were they asking me if I was stupid or smart? Or were they asking me why I looked different from them, with darker skin?


Concluding that it was the latter, I would say, ""I'm Indian.""


The next question was predictable: ""What tribe?""


""No, No,"" I would say, ""Indian from India!"" Eventually, I caught on and began to give that as the answer in the first place.


Years later, when I launched a magazine for Americans of Indian heredity, I faced the more practical aspects of the name problem. Once, when we were working on a historical piece about Indians from India in the United States, I looked in the library card file and found a whole drawer labeled ""Indians.""


""Success,"" I thought to myself. I selected one title that sounded promising and traipsed through the rows of books until I spotted the target volume. I pulled it down from the shelf expectantly.


On the cover, in full color, was a picture of Chief Sitting Bull. I'd been had.


I asked a librarian for assistance. She couldn't find what I was looking for, either, Choosing an identification line for the magazine was also a challenge. The most logical choice seemed to be ""The magazine for Indian Americans."" This, I reasoned, was the way all other ethnic groups did it. There were Polish Americans, Mexican Americans, Chinese Americans. Unfortunately, ""Indian Americans"" often became confused with ""American Indians.""


Other Indians-from-India proposed solutions. How about ""Asian Indian American?"" A well-intentioned friend who is not Indian proposed ""East Indian,"" not realizing that the East Indies are a set of islands nowhere near India.


The clearest solution seemed to be ""The magazine for Indians from India."" But the more I thought about it, the funnier it sounded. ""Indians from India."" It was so redundant. Like ""Americans from America,"" or ""Canadians from Canada.""


I decided to get to the bottom of the problem. I would campaign to have the term ""Indians"" reserved for people from India. I thought Columbus Day would be a good time to begin.


When I told a friend who is a lawyer about the proposal, she was unenthusiastic. ""The American Indians have been using that name for 500 years,"" she argued.


""It's like you abandoned your trademark. Anyway, the statute of limitations has run out. You should have done something sooner.""

LOS ANGELES -- ""If I had the opportunity to exchange places with someone, it would be the president of the United State,"" said the new 1989 Miss Los Angeles Chinatown, Dale Wong, during the question and answer session of the pageant Saturday.


Amidst cheers and applause from the audience, Wong explained that she would trade places with the president ""only because I find his job very challenging and exciting, and perhaps I can help him a little bit because I am an economic major.""


The 22-year-old beauty queen, who indicated that she likes to be around ambitious people, said her ambition is ""to pursue an advanced degree such as a master's of business administration, and to achieve a level of success whereby I could help others in my community.""


She also likes to learn about different cultures and languages and hold discussions with close friends. Her bobbies include: old movies, traveling, eating, and going out with friends and relatives.


In relation to her job, the 5'4"", 105-pound Bank of America employee said being in a service-oriented industry means ""you always have to serve the customers with a smile -- be very friendly, courteous and treat them as if you were on the other side (of the counter)."" And she said that with a smile.


Wong was also voted ""the most photogenic"" by photographers and reporters at the pageant. Her awards include a $2,000 scholarship and two round-trip air tickets to Taiwan.

The nation breathed a sigh of relief when the Oliver North trial ended on 5/4/89 with guilty verdicts' on three counts and acquittal on the other nine counts. An editorial in the New York Times on 5/5/89. ""Why the North Verdict is Welcome,"" stated:


The jury's verdict in the Oliver North trial is cause for satisfaction, not elation or disappointment. The ambitious former National Security Council staff member is guilty of three serious felonies but not guilty of nine others. He emerges as neither national hero nor villain.


Mr. North is a zealol whose personal brand of patriotism drove him to help direct twin disasters, the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran and the diversion of weapons, profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. It also led him -- criminally, the jury says -- to shred documents and flout the law in a cover-up when Congress made legitimate inquiries.


The verdict is satisfying not as a triumph for opponents of Mr. North's policies but as a vindication of law and orderly process; that, and a solemn judgment that the law, however politically disagreeable, must be respected by its servants. The result also vindicates the heroic, uphill effort to inform the public about Mr. North's activities without prejudicing the court's ability to fix criminal responsibility.


The verdict of the North jury was not punitive because it could have been worse; nor was it a reward for North's patriotism because he was found guilty of three counts of criminal behavior, and it could not be patriotic because Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell will be a strict taskmaster when he metes out the punishment for Oliver North sometime in July. The colonel will be lucky if he is not sent to jail.


It seems to me that the jury selected to try Oliver North was selected with a great deal of skill and a credit to the American judicial process after reading their interviews by David Rosenbaum in a special dispatch from Washington to the New York Times on 5-6-89.


I remembered a statement made by President Harry Truman when he pointed to a sign on his desk in the White House, ""The Buck Stops Here."" The Oliver North criminal jury lamented the fact that no one higher than Oliver North took the responsibility and the blame, while the retired ""action officer"" took the punishment! Mr. Rosenbaum wrote the subhead for the interviews with the North jury on the day after the trial (5-6-89) with the caption ""Jurors See North as a Scapegoat for His Superiors."" (New York Times 5-6-89).


What is News?


When I was a cub reporter for a local newspaper I was once told that if a dog bites a man, it is not news; if a man bites a dog, it could be news. For over a half a century I have been dabbling in journalism. Like most of you I hate to read the Sunday papers because good people seldom make news; the other kind of people fill column after column.


To my delight, Christopher Matthews, chief of the S.F. Examiner's Washington bureau, wrote two full columns of good news in last Sunday's Examiner (5/7/89).


I was looking for his comments on the Oliver North trial and to my pleasant surprise he wrote a column on ""Five Profiles in Courage.""


Anthony Palzo, the New Jersey Railroad conductor, rescued two children, ages 18 months and three years, from instant death as they were in the path of a moving train on the New Jersey R.R.


The second profile was Dr. C. Everett Koop, retiring U.S. surgeon general and the nemesis of the tobacco industry, who almost single-handedly challenged the industry of cancer-causing tobacco. It was like David vs. Goliath.


The third was retired Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Paul Volcker who slew the dragon of inflation during the Reagan administration.


The fourth was Rudolph Giuliani, former U.S. attorney of New York who has ""guts to fight crime on the mean streets of the Mafia or the celestial cubicles of Wall Street.""


The fifth was about a humble schoolteacher, Ms. Gloria Pipkin, and her struggle against ignorance and suspicion in a small Florida community.


I think it was President John F. Kennedy who wrote ""Profiles in Courage"" before he was president of the U.S.

LOS GATOS -- Shock, disappointment, shame, regret, humiliation and sadness were only some of the emotions experienced by Yuan Zhou, Wei-Hua Jiang, Kong-Fei Zhou, Hui Li-Hui Su and Quan Liu, exchange students at Los Gatos High School who had made plans to return home at the end of June with their host families. Because of the situation in China, however, they will be remaining here to continue their education.


Bun Lum, teacher and chairperson of the Los Gatos High School business education department, is very concerned about the five Chinese students who have gained a place in the hearts of both their host families and community.


""All intentions of going home now are out of the question because it could be dangerous. Everything was going so smoothly but plans have all been changed. It's a pity because I was looking forward to returning to China with the students and their host families for a visit during the last week of June. Now the program will be placed on hold for a while. Hopefully that's all it will be, just for a while.""


Bun, born in Oakland and married with two sons, has always been interested in education. After receiving his bachelors degree from UC Berkeley, he went on to receive his masters at San Francisco State. He began his teaching career at Los Gatos High School where he has been on the faculty for over 30 years.


The idea of a foreign exchange student program began years ago when Bun took a trip to Guangdong, China, and met with Yiao BenTang, principal of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Middle School in Zhongshan City. From that one . . . other school principals in the area became interested; in fact, several, of them came from China to visit Los Gatos High School's facilities and meet with its administrators.


After a year of negotiations between the American Consulate and the People's Republic of China, Kam Kwong, board member of the New China Education Foundation in San Francisco, and restaurant owner, became involved in the project and raised funds in order to sponsor the students' trips in cooperation with Los Gatos High School.


Bun, seeing his dream coming true, contacted friends and colleagues, and through his efforts, found host families for these students.


""I guess I can't ask for more. My five kids did extremely well academically being the first high school students to study here from China. Through this program they have learned how to get along with their host families, their American peers, and have seen a different way of life. That's the most important thing!""


Bun a modest man, is worried about conditions in China and has become attached to the five students in his care. Sitting with them in the classroom, he tried to alleviate their fears, offering support as they spoke.


""It saddens me to see what has happened and what China has done in the eyes of the world,"" Hui Li-Hui Su (Wei) commented as she picked up a newspaper. Her eyes were teary as she continued to look at the headlines on the paper. ""I had no idea that my country and people were so poor. In China, for a family to have one television is really an accomplishment, but here in America, some homes have more than two. Here in the U.S. people are not as frugal as we are. We worry more as a family unit and save everything we have. Nothing is wasted in China.""


The 18-year-old from Guangzhou is active with the Los Gatos Presbyterian Church because of her two host sisters, Kristy and Katie. The one thing she finds difficult is adjusting to thinking only in terms of herself. Studying here has opened her eyes to many changes and foods. She loves cream of mushroom chicken over rice and french fries, and says she can never get enough.


Quan Liu (Victoria), 17, also from Guangzhou, reacted strongly to the news. ""I was shocked at the news of the student massacre in Beijing. I have been in contact with my father throughout the events. China seems so far away, like another world, another place and another time. My parents are happy that I am far away from what has happened over there.""


She paused just for a moment to wipe a tear from her eyes. ""I miss my parents. I guess that is normal. I really shouldn't complain because I am here with a good host family. I have been lucky in both places, America and China. I do not come from a poor family in China and being the only child, I am the center of my parents lives. Studying here in America I understand more about people and what my country needs.""


Yuan Zhou (Amy), 18, also from Guangzhou, was disappointed with what has transpired in China. ""How could this happen? Why now when things were just coming together? Economics and trade were better and tourism was beginning to catch on. Why?"" She hung her head in disbelief as if she were responsible for what happened in her country.


""You know when I first got here, I was really homesick. It's hard not to be when you are away from family. I had never left the country before and Americans were strange to me. I am proud of my country and being Chinese, and it's only normal for me to speak Chinese and think the Chinese way, but I can see now that I have to have an open mind, that China isn't the only place in the world. Living with my host family, I have tried to see things through their eyes and am trying to learn how to speak better English. They have been very patient with me. Sometimes I know I can be impossible!""


Jiang Wei-Hau (Jena Hope), 18, from Guangzhou, who usually bubbles with enthusiasm, appeared troubled with the news.


""I am heartsick over what has happened. I can see pity in people's eyes now when they talk to me and I know this is a step backwards. I just wish it hadn't happened.""


When Jena first arrived she was nervous about her host family and new surroundings because of what she had heard about America. ""Young people here have no respect for the elderly, most youngsters spend their money on drugs and alcohol and there are many teenage suicides. Poor people sleep under bridges and come out of the dark to kill you.""


Jena fells she is lucky to have two mothers. Both of them feel so strongly for her that she has two names. Honored by their choices she explained, ""In Chinese, Jiang Wei-Hau means China's first satellite because I was born after the revolution. My Chinese mother wanted me to experience new things and be happy in a world where peace and mankind will unite to form a stronger bond. The name Jena is special because it's my American host's grandmother's name and Hope was chosen for my future.""


Kong-Fei Zhou (Joe), 19, from Guangzhou, the only male in the group, was crushed by the news from China. ""This is bad. I didn't think this would lead to so much bloodshed. It is sad time for China. This is not supposed to happen.""


According to Joe's American host father, when the young man first arrived he was shy and insecure, but through the school year he has emerged as a pleasant individual with a wonderful sense of humor. Although his English is limited he had no trouble describing things and he eventually gets his message across.


His host family showed him how much they care about him by putting on a garage sale at Stanford to help raise funds for his stay in America.


Head hung low, Joe, usually happy with an easy smile, who likes to read Chinese comic books, appeared despondent and couldn't even muster a grin when Carol Lin, newscaster from KNTV Channel 11, interviewed the Los Gatos High School students to get their reaction on the situation in their country.


Bun spoke for them, ""Regardless of anything that has happened, they believe in China and know that when this madness is over, they will return smarter, more aware and open-minded about the wonderful people in the United States who showed them that we are a country who care.""

LOS ANGELES -- The United States Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a case involving ""English-only"" policies in the workplace.


The high court vacated a lower federal court's judgement on the Alva Gutierrez case, making the case no longer an effective precedent. The case was dismissed because Gutierrez no longer works at the job where her complaint originated.


Gutierrez, a former employee at the Huntington Park Municipal Court, had sued and won a lawsuit changing discrimination against her former employer last April. Three white judges had passed an order prohibiting the employees from speaking any languages other than English at work except for situations where it is required by their jobs.


""It is definitely a step back ward in our battle against English-only type rules,"" said Kent Wong, an attorney at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, who represented Gutierrez in her case.


""The order to vacate puts us back to square one,"" agreed Kathy Imahara, a paralegel at the legal center.


However, Wong said, the high court's declaring the appeal of the case ""moot"" is not as bad as reversing the federal court's decision.


""It mean's that English-only in the workplace is still a gray area, an area that still has to be challenged in the courts,"" said Wong.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Even two months after the quake rattled through the Bay Area, donations are still coming into the coffers of Salvation Army.


Two weeks ago, a woman stepped into the Chinatown Salvation Army and donated $20,000 towards quake relief.


""We were very encouraged by such a large donation,"" said Major Check Yee of the Salvation Army.


The mysterious woman, listed only as Vai Fong Lun Lee in the receipt book, drove in from Saratoga and handed the $20,000 to one of the church officers. The well-dressed woman only said that the money should go to help those who were affected by the quake.


""I assume she is one of our television viewers,"" said Major Yee, referring the Salvation Army television show that airs on Sunday nights on Channel 66.


Judy Vaughn, a Salvation Army spokesperson, said the $20,000 donation is not the largest donation she has seen but it is ""certainly a significant contribution.""


Chinese language newspapers have reported that their readers have contributed about $250,000 toward quake relief.


According to Major Yee, the Salvation Army has spent $4 million in the Bay Area to help quake victims but needs $3 million more for the next few months.


After the quake, members of the Chinatown Salvation Army collected $11,000 for the quake relief fund. ""Our members responded in force,"" he said.


Major Yee mentioned that the Chinese Baptist Church of Berkeley and the San Francisco Evangelical Church also pitched in with donations.


Vaughn said most of the money is now going into low-income housing in the Santa Cruz and Watsonville areas.


""Donations are still coming in from all over the country,"" she said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Kikkoman Corp. has been taken to court by one of its former board members, who claims that the company owes him up to $40 million because of a joint agreement made in 1957.


The first phase of the case ended Oct. 3 in a victory for the plaintiff, Jozo Sugihara of San Francisco, when a Superior Court jury rejected Kikkoman's contention that the suit could not proceed because of the statute of limitations.


While disappointed with the decision Kikkoman attorney James Gilliland, Jr., maintained that there was no conclusion reached on the merits of Sugihara's case. The second phase, which began Oct. 5, is focusing on that issue.


According to Chinin Tana, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, Sugihara, 72, and the soy sauce company entered a joint venture in 1957 with Sugihara investing $20,000 and Kikkoman $30,000.


Sugihara's attorneys say an oral agreement gives him a 40 percent interest in the joint venture, which includes two vehicles: a marketing company -- Kikkoman International -- and a manufacturing operation in Wisconsin.


Sugihara's role in establishing the Japanese company in the U.S. went beyond the $20,000 investment, said Tana. ""He's also put in the business he had been developing for the prior six years... (the venture) started from day one with everything in place.""


The relationship between Sugihara and Kikkoman ""symbolized a lot of things that happened in the '50s,"" said Tana, in the sense that Japanese companies ""really needed people like Mr. Sugihara"" to help them with such details as advertising and labeling in the unfamiliar U.S. market.


He added that Sugihara was made Kikkoman's sole agent in charge of selling its products to the non-Asian market.


The disagreement over Sugihara's share of Kikkoman International's operations dates back to 1984, when, in retiring, he was asked to be paid for his share in the venture.


Gilliland said that any money Sugihara is entitled to would come from a stock agreement he signed in 1981. The most he could get is $250,000, according to Kikkoman's attorneys.


During the first phase, Kikkoman's attorneys argued that enforcement of an oral contract must happen within two years of its breach. Sugihara's attorneys countered that he could not sue the company for refusing to honor the joint venture until 1984, when he sought to withdraw from the agreement.


After hearing almost two months of testimony, the jury ""resoundingly rejected Kikkoman Corp.'s defense,"" said Tana


As the plaintiff's side presented its case during the second phase, Rex Coleman, a specialist in Japan-U.S. law, was called as an expert witness. He addressed the issue of whether the two parties entered into a goben.


The term, which Tana said appears in a document Kikkoman submitted to the Japanese government at the time of the agreement, is defined as ""two parties investing together to jointly manage a business enterprise.""


On the issue of whether Kikkoman had an agreement with the company Sugihara owned in 1957 or with Sugihara as an individual, Coleman, citing legal precedents, said it was the latter.


Tana said that position was further strengthened by a deposition from the late Koichiro Takanashi, who arranged the agreement. ""He said he didn't know whether there was a joint venture, but he and Mr. Sugihara agreed to invest together.... He made the deal with Mr. Sugihara.""


Another issue in the suit, according to Tana, is ""breaches of fiduciary duty.... an obligation to treat Mr. Sugihara fairly.""


For example, he said, Sugihara sold his controlling interests in Japan Food Corp. because of a possible conflict of interest as a party in the joint venture. If Kikkoman did not believe there was a joint venture, it should have told him at that time, Tana stated.


Further, he added, concerning the signed stock agreement, Sugihara believed he was not obligated to sell his stock back to Kikkoman because of the joint venture agreement. Moreover, an ""ambiguous"" valuation interpretation ""raises issues of fairness,"" stated Tana.


Gilliland said testimony on behalf of the plaintiff is expected to continue for a couple more weeks, after which the defense will present its case. He predicted the case will not reach its conclusion until December.


He said Kikkoman's attorneys hope to ""establish there was no contract as claimed by Mr. Sugihara.... In our view, there never was an oral agreement in 1957.""

BOSTON -- Kitty Dukakis and state officials will speak at a recognition ceremony this Friday for an innovative program that's helping refugee women move from state welfare to jobs in child care.


The child care traning program, which began last September and ended in June allowed 28 Southeast Asian women in the cities of Lowell and Chelsea to gain valuable skills they can use to obtain jobs.


The program, which students attended five days a week, offered classes in English as a second language, child care and an internship at a local day care center.


Following the program the women were awarded a certificate in child development from Wheelock College that specializes in educating child care providers.


Elma Vaidya, project director of employment services at the Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association in Lowell, said she was pleased with the way the program ran.


""I think it was very positive,"" said Vaida, who added that she saw a big difference in the women from the time they came in, to the time they graduated.


""It got them out of the house, taking the public transportation, and built their self-estem.""


She said prior to the program many of participants were not very independent because of not being acclimated to American life.


Dan Lam, director of the Massachusetts Office of Refugees and Immigrants that provided the federal grants for the program, said they now have the skills necessary to stand on their own feet financially.


The ORI, an agency within the Massachusetts Executive Office of Human Services, lobbies for refugees in state government and coordinates the activities in the state agencies which serve them.

SUNNYVALE -- On June 9, an overflow audience of 700 attended an evening benefit by Stanford University Chinese students and professors.


It featured the reading of an eyewitness account of the Beijing Massacre and a videotaped presentation of the demonstrations. Performances included selections by a choir of male and female students; there were several vocal soloists, including a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, who composed a melody and lyrics of three songs he wrote commemorating the students' heroism.


A former dancer with the Beijing State Dance Company performed a dramatic dance of a Chinese general, which he dedicated to the Beijing demonstrators. He is now studying computer science at Stanford.


The event was held at the Chinese American Culture Center in Sunnyvale.


In a separate interview, Stanford student leader Yizi Xu described for Asian Week the newly organized Foundation for Democracy in China, consisting of pro-democracy scholars. Its goals included compensating families of the victims, setting up a government in exile, and developing long-term strategles.


He acknowledged that the Stanford scholars have a high level of fear about returning to China. Another problem was the lack of major figures for the people to rally around.

MONTEREY PARK -- A gift of about 11,000 Chinese books, valued at between $100,000 to $200,000, is on its way across the Pacific to the Bruggemeyer Memorial Library of Monterey Park from Taiwan.


And about 22 Lions Club officials from the Republic of China, headed by Chin-Sheng Lee, council chairman of Multiple District 300, Lions Club International, have traveled to Southern California to present the fruit of months of labor.


At a press conference sponsored by the Coordination Council for North American Affairs in Los Angeles Chinatown last wek, Lee said the Lions Club members in Taiwan were eager to help when they heard of the need for Chinese books in America. Shing-Fa Tsai, international secretary chief of the club, had visited Monterey Park early last year and spread the word upon his return.


With about 18,000 Lions Club members in Taiwan, the club aimed to collect one book from each to attain the goal of 10,000 volumes, Lee said. And because the campaign was endorsed by the government and received over-whelming reponse from the public, they completed the book drive in two months.


The campaign for donations of Chinese books in the Republic of China on Taiwan had originated in a ""casual"" conversation between Monterey Park Council-woman Judy Chu and Tsai at a luncheon meeting, Chu said. Tsai asked Chu what could be done to help Chinese Americans in Southern California, to which Chu replied, ""It would be great to have Chinese books donated to the Monterey Park library."" The 8,000 volumes of Chinese books then available seemed insufficient to meet the needs of the large number of Chinese-speaking immigrants from Taiwan, she added.


After the luncheon, Chu continued, they toured the Monterey Park library and met the librarians.


""To my amazement, (Tsai) said he could collect 10,000 books to sent to Monterey Park,"" Chu said.


""You have lived up to your words and we are very grateful for such a generous gift,"" she said at the press conference last week.


The collection of 10,865 includes many volumes with bilingual texts, and are classified in the following categories:


1. Fiction, novels, martial arts -- 2,293 volumes


2. Historical fiction -- 916 volumes


3. Essays, literary works, biographies -- 1,120 volumes


4. Translated Western literary works, poems -- 818 volumes


5. Children's books including cartoons -- 2,064 volumes


6. Chinese books on cooking, flower arrangements, drama, entertainment, movies -- 956 volumes


7. Books on calligraphy, painting, finance, data information, business administration, trade -- 2,020 volumes


8. Reference books, dictionaries, books on gardening, Chinese medicine, handicrafts -- '578 volumes


9. Collector's edition of the United Daily News -- 100 volumes.


The books are scheduled to arrive next month around Chinese New Year on Feb. 6, Lee said.


Hopefully, the books would help to provide a greater understanding of the Chinese culture for the community, and help younger immigrants gain a greater appreciation of their heritage, he added.


Despite earlier objections to housing large volumes of foreign books in the main building of the library, ""the plan is to keep the entire collection in the library. I think we'll have adequate amount of space for all of them,"" said Elizabeth Minter, Monterey Park city librarian.

Stanley Kwan, whose third film, ""Rouge,"" has enjoyed great success and was featured at this year's S.F. International Film Festival, is one of the promising young directors now working in Hong Kong.


Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1957 and attended the Pui Ching Middle School, where he was interested in drama. In 1976 he enrolled in the Baptist College as a communications major, and the same year joined Hong Kong TVB's Artistes Training Centre. After two years of college, Kwan continued with HK-TVB as a full-time production assistant and soon worked his way up to assistant director. There was quite a bit of overlap between the television and film industries, and when some young directors left TV to form a ""New Wave Hong Kong Cinema,"" Kwan went with them.


""Rouge,"" produced by Jackie Chan and made for Golden Harvest, Ltd., proved difficult for Kwan following the first cut. (He'd been given a free hand up to that point.) He wanted to make a film comparing relationships of the 1930s with those of the 1980s, but the studio wanted a spooky ghost story with lots of special effects. However, after his version won three prizes at the 1987 Taiwan Golden Horse Awards, Kwan got his way.


The director has just finished shooting his latest film in New York City. It has the working title of ""Full Moon Over New York,"" and tells the story of three Chinese women -- one from Hong Kong, one from Taiwan, and one from the People's Republic -- who meet and become friends. The film is currently in post-production, and should be released in Hong Kong this summer.


Next on Kwan's agenda will be a movie about Yuan Lin Yu, a legendary silent screen actress from the Mainland who committed suicide in 1935, the result of a love triangle that got into the papers. (She left a note that simply said, ""Rumor killed me."")


Actually, the picture will be a film within a film, along the lines of ""The French Lieutenant's Woman,"" with popular Hong Kong singer Anita Mui, who starred in ""Rouge"" (winning the 1987 Golden Horse Award for Best Actress), playing a dual role as herself and as Yuan Lin Yu.


Kwan sees this film as an opportunity to again explore the contrasts between 1930s mores and those of today, this time without the supernatural element of ""Rouge,"" and to examine the complex matrix of Chinese politics, past and present. Shooting is not expected to begin until late this year or early 1990.


On making films in Hong Kong, Kwan says that it's difficult to be artistic because the market is so limited. Producers only want to finance films that are likely to have commercial success.


On the other hand, with the emerging generation of New Wave directors, he feels that more artistic possibilities are opening up: ""The trick is to make commercially viable films that still have artistic merit.""

For the past two weeks I tried not to think nor write about Tiananmen Square to quiet my conscience about man's inhumanity to man. But with the execution of Wang Weilan, the young student who stopped the column of tanks on Tiananmen Square; the U.S. Senate vote of 81-10 on 7/14/89 to impose sanctions on China, the earlier unanimous vote of the House of Representatives; the extension of the stay of the Chinese students in the U.S. if the president deems it necessary, all these actions caused my conscience to revolt over and over against the Tiananmen atrocities on June 4-8, 1989. While the civilized world's attention was centered on Paris, France over the 200th anniversary of liberty, equality and fraternity, the young people who died in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, ""did not die in vain,"" nor can we forget them.


David R. Schweisberg, writing for United Press International with a Beijing dateline of 7-14-89 in the S.F. Examiner.


BEIJING -- Beijing authorities have launched what may be the most sweeping political investigation in more than a decade to identify and purge anyone who participated in the democracy movement, Chinese and foreign sources say.


The campaign by the Communist Party, government and security agencies has already spread through many Beijing workplaces, from newsrooms to factory floors, said Chinese interviewed recently.


A key intent appears to be erasing resistance to the crackdown on leaders of the student-led democracy movement by the millions who supported the protests.


It also aims to terrorize the city's 10 million people into submission as the party tries to close ranks, squelch dissent and tighten control over political, economic and cultural life, the sources say.


'We're into a very severe campaign,' said a Western diplomat specializing in Chinese politics. 'It's the old-time religion, the (1966-76) Cultural Revolution stuff. They're using all the old techniques.'


The probe is, so far, concentrated in Beijing, where anti-government protests in April and May were the biggest since the founding of communist China in 1949. The army suppressed the protesters the weekend of June 3, igniting what officials called a 'counter-revolutionary rebellion.'


Tommy Chinn


With apologies to two of my distinguished colleagues Carolyn Gan and Gerrye Wong, I am invading their territories this week. This is not a socioeconomic nor a political story, but I shall be remiss if I don't write this column myself.


Tommy Chinn was my guest of honor when I retired in 1980 from the U.S. Postal Service. We were in Troop 3, Boy Scouts of America together, and when we went to college, we went our separate ways. When I returned to San Francisco in 1936, Tommy was the co-publisher and editor of the Chinese Digest, the first Chinese American weekly news journal. I signed on as sociological data editor and stayed with the paper until 1939. Due to the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island, I gave up journalism for public relations. We formed the Chinese Junior Chamber of Commerce as a branch of the San Francisco Junior Chamber of Commerce. Myron Chan was the president and Dr. Theodore C. Lee was the chairman of the Chinatown Housing Committee. Prior to World War II this was the campaign for Ping Yuen, the Chinatown low cost housing project. World War II came, and everything was put on ""hold."" After the war I went into politics, and Tommy remained in journalism.


Ever true to his profession, Tommy will release his monumental work this fall, a history of San Francisco Chinatown, Bridging the Pacific. It will be Tommy's contribution: the first authoritative historical compilation of the Chinese people in San Francisco.


Dr. and Mrs. Edwin Owyang


The Owyangs will celebrate their 50th anniversary at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Burlingame on Aug. 26, 1989. ""Doc"" Owyang served as a medical doctor with the Y-Force of the Merrill's Marauders in Yunnan, China, during World War II. He retired as a full colonel and returned to San Francisco Chinatown to practice medicine.


Immediately after V-J Day in 1945, Cathay Post #384, American Legion had a membership of over 1,000 honorably discharged veterans. To be elected a post commander meant not only to be powerful in San Francisco Chinatown, but also in the Department of California and National American Legion politics. Spencer Owyang, Leland Kimlau, Johnny Bow, Lee J. Poo were World War I commanders, and Doc Owyang led the corps of World War II commanders in Chinatown. He was not interested in American Legion or city politics.


He devoted his energies to his family and his medical practice in San Francisco and San Mateo counties. We used to kid Doc about his ""Owyang basketball team"" that can beat any family in San Mateo. Many happy returns Doc and Alyce and may the next 50 years be as prosperous!

LOS ANGELES -- The Japanese American National Museum recently announced the addition of 13 new members to its Board of Trustees and Board of Governors, according to Irene Hirano, museum director.


Selected from a variety of professional fields, the new members will add experience and technical expertise to an already diverse and working board.


""All of these people -- in their own ways -- will be a tremendous asset to the Museum,"" said Hirano. ""We thank them for their support and are happy to welcome them on board.""


Tetsuo Yamashita, principal partner of Harte Yamashita & Forest of L.A., hopes that his 30 years of experience in the graphic design business will allow him to contribute to the development of the museum.


""I feel very strongly about participating for our heritage and for our future,"" said Yamashita. ""What's really important is the scope of the museum. It's not just for a small group of people. It's for the entire country. That's what makes me excited about it.""


Henry Nakabayashi, an architect for Feola Dennihan in Glendale, first heard about the museum from his son, who served as a volunteer last year. A friend later asked him if he would serve on the Board of Trustees, and after some thought, he agreed. Nakabayashi serves on the building facilities committee, and brings over 30 years of architectural experience to the museum at a time when its site is in its renovation stage.


""I thought it would be an interesting experience,"" said Nakabayashi. ""I've been very impressed by the organization of this board.""


Dr. Ronald H. Akashi of Monterey Park joins the Board of Trustees with over 10 years of medical experience and also serves as a professor at the USC School of Medicine and the Doheny Eye Institute.


""I am honored to be a member of this team,"" said Dr. Akashi. ""The Japanese American National Museum's commitment to be a world class museum of Japanese American history is the way it should be told and remembered for the future generations.""


Also joining the Board of Trustees include: Brian Kaneko, principal of Kaneko/Metzgar Associates of L.A.; Chip Mamiya of Southwest Financial Services in Gardena; and Paul A. Sumi, director of research for MGM/UA in Culver City.


San Francisco attorney Dale Minami, well known for the Coram Nobis defense of Gordon Hirabayashi, Min Yasui and Fred Korematsu, is among a distinguished group of people joining the Board of Governors, the museum's international body of goodwill ambassadors, technical advisors and supporters.


Minami a Sansei, believes that Japanese Americans have a rich cultural tradition that needs to be restored and preserved. A recent look through his family photo album told him that even though this was a struggling immigrant family in the 1920s and '30s, they were still maintaining a sense of pride in their Japanese heritage through festivals and activities.


""But our history stopped in 1942,"" he said. ""The smiles on the family photos were gone. We lost our sense of history because our parents didn't talk about it anymore.""


Minami believes that the museum can carry on ""our rich tradition"" and he looks forward to his role of publicizing the museum's activities to the people of the Bay Area.


Those joining Minami on the Board of Governors include: Siegfred S. Kagawa, chairman and CEO of Occidental Underwriters of Hawaii, Ltd.; Catherine E. Massey, senior associate of InterMatrix USA of Marietta, Georgia; Albert H. Taira, CEO of Taira Services, Corp. in L.A.; Tomoye and Henri Takahashi of the Takahashi Foundation in San Francisco; and Eiichi Yoshida, president of Sunnyside Nursery, Inc. of Hayward.


Those elected to the executive committee of the board at a recent annual meeting include: Bruce T. Kaji, president; Kay Kayoko, Inose, v.p. of administration; Takashi Shida, AIA, v.p. of facility development; Fred Y. Hoshiyama, v.p. of financial development; Mikiko Tanimura, v.p. of human resources; Chiyeko Chen, v.p. of long range planning; Young O. Kim, v.p. of nominations; Takashi Makinodan, Ph.D., v.p. of program; Henry Ota, secretary; Kei Higashi, treasurer; and Manabi Hirasaki, member-at-large.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Congressman Howard Berman will be in Chinatown this Friday to speak at the ""Banquet for Fairness"" in family immigration.


The fundraiser, sponsored by the Committee for Immigration Justice and the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, will be held at the New Asia Restaurant beginning at 6 p.m.


Berman, who will serve as keynote speaker at the $100-a-plate event, is the author of an immigration bill in the House that defends family reunification.


Bill Hing, co-chair of CIJ, called the Berman bill ""one of the most progressive proposals"" on immigration reform during a press conference announcing the congressman's visit.


Hing noted that in contrast to the Kennedy-Simpson bill that already passed in the Senate, Berman's bill does not place a worldwide ceiling on immigration visas for family reunification, does not cut back on any family preference category and doesn't allow the transfer of power to the president to adjust the number of immigrants allowed into the U.S.

BERKELEY -- The largest ethnic minority class in the 86-year history at the University of California's School of Law (Boalt Hall) convened last week when the fall 1989 term began on Tuesday.


The news comes from Edward G. Tom, the new director of admissions and financial aid at the prestigious law school. Prior to accepting the position, Tom served as the acting director for two years.


Tom, believed to be the sole Asian American law school admissions director in the country, oversees an enrollment that averages over 5,800 applicants for only 270 available seats.


Tom said that the increase among all ethnic minorities has been phenomenal over the years. Of this year's class, Asians represent the largest group among ethnic minority students at the law school.


This year's class of 273 students has 38 Asians, 27 blacks, 31 Chicano/Latinos and five American Indians. And over 40 percent of the class is made up of women.


These enrolled minority students were among 566 Asians who applied for admission, 490 blacks, 406 Hispanics and 48 American Indians.


Tom said that in 1975 when he began work at the university, there were only 23 Asians in the law school.


He attributes the increase of Asian applicants and law students in recent years to the population increase in general and also the school's active recruitment of minority students. He added that there tends to be an added interest in law among Asians, and a growing view among Asians that law as a profession contributes to society and that it is empowering.


""I think that there's a realization about this profession (by Asians) that this is a profession they can do,"" said Tom who formerly headed up admissions at Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco. Drawing from his own experience, he believes that a lot of Asians are pressured into entering the sciences or medicine.


Tom said that minorities and students at large are attracted to Boalt because because it is one of the top law schools in the country and by far the least expensive in comparison with private schools of the same caliber.


Tom, 42, who grew up in Monterey County and received a degree from UC Berkeley in sociology in 1970, said he really enjoys his job as director of admissions.


""It's a real opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people and make a contribution to a very important profession,"" said Tom. He also views his position as one of important responsibility.


""There is the responsibility to give every single one of the applications a fair evaluation, which takes a lot of time and a good pair of glasses,"" said Tom. ""And there's the responsibility to ensure that the admission process is carried forth in an even-handed way."" Tom said there's also the the challenge to ensure that people of all aspects of society know that the law school is accessible to them.


He said he's both ""excited and pleased"" that he has ben named to head the office and that he is looking forward to the coming admission cycle.

NEW YORK -- Time magazine dubbed her ""Queen of the Middle Kingdom"" and People named her ""The Most Famous Woman in China."" And Mike Wallace of ""60 Minutes"" called her ""one of the unsung glories of cable television.""


In China she is both a model and an idol. She sets trends with her hair and clothing. Despite all the accolades, Yue-Sai Kan has yet to become a household name in the United States.


Now Kan is poised to assault over 40 million U.S. television homes this fall when her series ""Looking East"" and ""One World"" debut on cable's Discovery Channel.


""Looking East"" is a half-hour weekly series which provides an inside look at the life, the people and the places of Asia. ""One World"" is a series of eight one-hour shows which explore the cultures and customs of various countries. The show originally premiered on China Central Television in 1986 and was the first original series produced by an American for broadcast in China.


Kan is both host and executive producer of the two Discovery Channel series. Her television career has taken her to more than 20 countries and given her the opportunity to interview an array of world figures such as the Pope, Mother Theresa and Queen Margaret of Denmark, as well as presidents and prime ministers.


She is most excited about ""Looking East"" because it lets her focus on Asia, a vast continent with endless ideas. ""Asia is a fascinating place to start with,"" she said. ""It is like a blank canvas.""


The premier episodes of ""Looking East"" will focus on life in Taiwan and will also broadcast on China Central Television, marking the first time that China will allow programs about Taiwan to be aired on its national network.""


Kan, the oldest of four sisters, is the daughter of painter Kan Wing-Lin. During the political turmoil of the revolution in 1949, her family left China for Hong Kong when she was only a year old. She came to the United States to attend college.


Kan's television career began as a gamble. About 17 years ago Kan and her sister Vickie were already riding high running a multi-million dollar import-export business, when she was asked to be a volunteer anchorperson on Manhattan Cable's ""Chinese Service."" She became hooked on the possibilities of television, sold her interest in the company and plunked $500,000 of her money into creating ""Looking East.""


""I thought since I was doing very well,"" she said, ""why not take a risk in something I wanted to do.""


At first, Kan encountered many difficulties, but she persevered. ""I learned it all by myself,"" she said. ""Every time I made a mistake, I learned fast because it was my own money that I was using.""


Although ""Looking East"" began on a small scale on Manhattan Cable, it opened the way and soon gained national distribution on small cable networks, which led to the creation of documentaries on Asian culture.


Kan's rise to the top came in 1984. Two days before PBS was to broadcast live the 35th anniversary celebration of the People's Republic of China from Beijing, the station learned that the narration and speeches were in Chinese only, rendering the broadcast to the American audience useless. In the station's frantic search for someone who knew Chinese culture and could translate the broadcast, Kan was discovered.


She dispels the notion that Asians are discriminated against in the television industry. At least in her experience, she hasn't encountered any racism.


""Your color makes no difference but it's how good you are,"" she said. ""If you're good, you're good.""


Kan believes hard work and persistence are the keys to succeeding in television and in any other field. She suggests Asians avoid thinking negatively and instead focus on their strengths.


""Being an Asian in this country, you have two Backgrounds,"" she said. ""I'm an immigrant and that enables me to bridge two cultures, East and West.""


Even though Kan left China at an early age, she still feels accepted by the Chinese people, who do not consider her to be an outsider.


""They consider me both because I'm of the same race and I speak the same language, but I'm also considered a foreigner because I speak Chinese with an accent,"" she said. ""I'm very exotic for them.""


A resident of New York, Kan keeps herself busy producing her shows, which hardly leaves her time to play the classical piano. She learned to play the piano at age four and later trained at Julliard. ""I harbor great pretensions of being a concert pianist.""


On the side she is working on a series of video cassettes on how to do business in Asia, which are due out this fall.


But whatever Kan plans on doing in the future, she will most likely try to be unique. ""I don't like to do things that have been done before.""

SAN FRANCISCO -- Following up on its victory last year. Lowell High School has placed first in this year's San Francisco Academic Decathlon. One-third of its winning team members have Asian surnames.


Coming in second was Lincoln High School; the third place winner was International Studies Academy. The competition took place over a seven-hour span last Saturday at Abraham Lincoln High School; results were announced Tuesday evening at the awards banquet at the Kensington Park Hotel at Union Square.


In winning, Lowell's nine-person team members -- Matthew Barnhart, Lee Cheng, Rachel Scherr, Magan Hiatt, Kendrick Hiu, Stella Schley, John Kim, Zachary Ross and Olga Texidor -- topped their counterparts at 11 other city high schools (Balboa, Burton, Galileo, International Studies Academy, Lincoln, McAteer, Mission, Presentation, Wallenberg, Washington and Wilson). Lowell will now prepare for the statewide Decathlon competition at Bakerfield College March 9-11; the winner of that will go to the national competition in Rhode Island later this year.


The Academic Decathlon was founded in 1968 and has been a national scholastic competition since 1982. Students are selected to participate based not only on their GPAs and counselors' recommendations, but also their exposure to a wide range of experiences in academics, as well as speech, drama and music. The competition this year included the ""Super Quiz,"" in which teams faced each other in answering questions under the subject of ""U.S.A. Presidency.""


""This year's decathlon was exciting competition with a four-way tie. Two schools tied for second place and we had a third place winner. The students supported each other so well, old friends from middle school were able to find each other again during breaks,"" said Margaret Culver, coordinator of the academic decathlon for the San Francisco Unified School District.


This year's Academic Decathlon was sponsored by the Rotary Club and the SFUSD; additional funding was sponsored by Just Desserts, Arthur Young & Co., Alex Brown & Sons, Inc. Simpson Paper Co., Bank of America Foundation, Simpson Paper Co., Wells Fargo Foundation, Coopers & Lybrand. Chevron U.S.A. and the Police Officers' Association.

I Hate English


By Ellen Levine


Illustrated by Steve Bjorkman


Ages 8 and up


Scholastic Hardcover, $12.95


With warmth and sensitivity, I Hate English gives us insight into the experience of newcomers to America or any new country. A deceptively simple and engaging story, the book follows a well-established literary technique of developing a character as a universal figure, or an everyman.


Mei Mei, a little girl newly arrived from Hong Kong, undergoes the common experience of adapting to change. Fastpaced and humorously illustrated, this multilayered story touches on some significant issues and leaves us with a greater understanding of the mind of an immigrant and an appreciation of a child's resilience.


Recently settled in New York City, Mei Mei is thankful to be insulated in her Chinatown neighborhood. Everything sounds and looks familiar on the street, in her home and in the Chinatown Learning Center. In school, however, where English is spoken, Mei Mei refuses to utter a single word.


As an immigrant, Mei Mei feels doubt, homesickness and a displacement that accompanies dramatic cultural change. She clutches at her native language like a talisman, an illusory guarantee against the intrusion of this other environment. By refusing to speak English, Mei Mei feels as though somehow she can stop the flow of new information and control the situation with steadfast inflexibility. She is rebelling in the only way possible and for a while, she is quite successful. When Mei Mei's precious insular would is threatened, she is furious. However, with gentle guidance from a wonderful teacher, Mei Mei learns that she need not fear change and that her thoughts and feelings are no less valid than if they were expressed in Chinese.


So while the story deals with change and adjustment, there is a strong message about the importance of an understanding individual who helps our heroine through this personal crisis. Nancy, an astute English language teacher, has probably never been through the same sort of traumatic changes that Mei Mei is experiencing. However, Nancy senses a hidden desire in the child and knows a new method has to be introduced to break through built-up defenses. Then quite without warning, Mei Mei speaks non-stop for 22 minutes -- in English!


Children need to be able to trust, to test and be confident that they will be accepted no matter what. How important it is for us as adults to be attentive to our children through all their various phases of growth: physical emotional and psychological.


And finally, Mei Mei, even in a small way, reminds us first, second, third, fourth and fifth generation Americans what our forebears underwent to become part of the dream. We are invited to recall the wealth of countries and customs left behind but not necessarily forgotten. We revel in the beauty of diversity that this country represents. We can speculate as to the frustrations, anxieties and fears of those who came before us, though for others the same changes may have been unimportant in relation, to the circumstances of their flight. Mei Mei is exceedingly lucky -- how much more difficult adjustment would have been had she encountered open hostility rather than a supportive environment. It will be easier for all of us to be more understanding towards the new child on the block, in the park or the classroom.


Mei Mei's teacher is a model for those of us who live in America already. Nancy is the wonderful neighbor who welcomes the stranger from a foreign land into her neighborhood and home unconditionally. It is not an easy transition for Mei Mei but with the help of her teacher, who is also her first American friend, we are confident that she will adjust. This is a truly delightful story.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The lawyer of a man who allegedly assaulted a police officer on a busy Chinatown street is pleading to the public for witnesses to the incident.


Police said Scott Kin Wah Chan, 45, hit a police officer after the officer wrote him a ticket for parking in a no-stopping zone. As a result the police have charged Chan with battery on a police officer and resisting arrest.


But Chan is claiming police brutality over the Sunday, August 13 incident.


According to the police report, reserve police officer Edwin Palma was on Grant Avenue near Pacific Street citing cars parked in a no- stopping zone. He approached Chan's vehicle and told his wife to move the car.


Palma, who was assigned to the Koban police cubicle on Grant Avenue, returned 10 minutes later and noticed that the car was still parked in the same spot. He then wrote a citation and handed it to Mrs. Chan.


As the police officer turned to leave, he was accosted by Chan. However, the accounts of Chan and Palma differ as to what happened next.


Palma said in his report that Chan came out of the store and shouted, ""Why did you give me a ticket? What is your badge number?"" The report said Chan then allegedly grabbed the police officer by the arm, spun him around, bumped him in the chest and gave him a bear hug.


Palma wrote that he tried to arrest and put handcuffs on him, but Chan resisted. He radioed for assistance and was soon joined by three other officers, who helped Palma arrest Chan.


Chan charges police brutality. Arnold Chin, who is representing Chan, said the police officer was the one who started the altercation. ""It appears the officer hit him first,"" said Chin.


He added that Chan only asked Palma to ""go back to the police station"" to discuss the citation. ""He only wanted to get the officer's attention and next thing he knew, he was down on the ground,"" Chin said.


Chan suffered injury to the left eye and cheek area, and his knees and elbows were bruised. Chin said the injuries seem to indicate he was either hit or thrown to the ground.


""I've gotten calls of outrage from people who say this sort of thing is not uncommon in Chinatown,"" Chin said. Chan already has filed a report wit The City's Office of Citizen Complaints.


So far no witness has surfaced. ""Historically, Asians don't want to come forward as witnesses,"" Chin said but added that four people have volunteered to be character witnesses on Chan's behalf.


He was miffed at the police because in one of the assisting officers' report, it said that there were about 100 to 150 people at the scene. Chin said, ""Miraculously, the police department did not find any witnesses to the incident. I'm sure if they made an effort, they would have found a witness.""


Chin asks anyone who witnessed the incident to give him a call at 931-2304.

LOS ANGELES -- Have you ever noticed that many of your Asian friends and relatives need glasses or contact lenses and wondered if Asians are more susceptible to near-sightedness than other ethnic groups?


According to Elaine Tannors, surgery coordinator at the Jensen Center where about 13,500 refractive surgeries had been performed by Ronald Jensen, M.D., to correct vision, about 25 percent of their patients have been Asians. This is a pretty high percentage considering Asians only comprised about 6 percent of the Southern California population in 1980.


In a recent introductory seminar on refractive surgery at the Woodland Hills Marriott Hotel, Jensen asserted that a higher percentage of Asians than the general population need glasses or contacts.


""This surgery would be fabulous in Japan because there are so many Japanese and other Oriental people that are near-sighted,"" Jensen said.


In a nutshell, said Jensen, refractive surgery is ""performing surgery on the surface of the eye to get rid of glasses."" And like everything that is new, refractive surgery is gradually gaining acceptance since its inception about 20 years ago.


He said in about 1972 a Russian boy, who suffered a cut in his eye when he fell off his bicycle, found that the injury almost eliminated his need for glasses. Since then experts have been studying and experimenting with refractive surgeries on animals.


""Near-sightedness is when the eye is longer than normal and the focus falls in front of the retina, giving blurry distance vision,"" he explained. The problem can be corrected by radial keratotomy, a refractive surgical procedure in which a series of fine microscopic incisions (usually eight) are placed on the surface of the cornea in a radial or spoke-like pattern. These incisions reduce the front curvature of the cornea, causing it to flatten. The flattening effect causes the rays entering the eye to be focused closer to the retina, instead of in front of it, resulting in more normal vision.


Another common vision problem, astigmatism, can also be corrected by a similar procedure, said Jense. Astigmatism occurs when the curve of the cornea is uneven, shaped more like a football than a basketball.


This irregularity makes it difficult for the patient to clearly focus on an object, causing a doubling effect. The procedure consists of making a series of fine incisions on the patient's cornea. The surgeon designs a custom surgery to flatten the steepest part of the cornea to obtain a more spherical shape.


Additionally, hexagonal keratotomy, in which a series of six microscopic incisions is performed on the cornea to form a hexagon, is used to increase the front curvature of the cornea to correct far-sightedness, Jensen said.


Patients receive surgeries on a ""walk-in/walk-out"" basis at his Glendale practice, Jensen said, and can usually go back to work after two days. Because the surgery procedure only takes about 15 minutes, most patients are amazed that it is over ""while they were just getting ready for it to start.""


Patients are given valium or other tranquilizers before the surgery for relaxation, and topical eye drops are used to anesthetize the eyes.


""Patients may feel some pressure on the eye during the surgery but they won't feel the incision. The discomfort (later) could amount to that of a contact lens abrasion. But most people would only feel a little scratchiness,"" Jensen said.


The eyes are usually operated on one at a time, with the operations scheduled a week apart, Jensen said. The cost for surgery on both eyes is $3,200.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Attorney General John Van de Kamp is running for governor. So when he came to Chinatown recently to discuss the rise in anti-Asian violence, he also seized the opportunity to boast about his department's record for placing a relatively high number of Asian Americans in high-level jobs.


All that is very true. But the aspiring Democratic candidate might wish to think twice before using that pitch before audiences of Filipinos, Pacific Islanders or Asian Pacific women.


Van de Kamp can rightly boast that Asian Pacific Americans make up more than 11 percent of his department's staff, and that none of those Asian Pacifics work in blue-collar job classifications such as janitors, custodians or laborers.


Seeing that California's 1989 population is estimated to be approximately 10 percent Asian Pacific, those ethnic communities appear to be well represented in the state's chief law enforcement agency.


But more careful inspection of the numbers reveals that Asian Pacifics -- and especially women, Filipinos and Pacific Islanders -- are heavily concentrated in clerical and technical jobs.


And though 66 Asian Americans in the attorney general's office are categorized as professionals, accounting for more than 8 percent of all professionals in the department, only four have reached the ""supervisory professional"" level.


The attorney general's office lists Filipinos and Pacific Islanders separately from Asians.


As of September 1989 Van de Kamp employed 136 Asian Pacifics in clerical positions. Nearly half -- 62 -- were Filipino women, and another 49 were Asian women while two were Pacific Islander women. Seven Asian men and 16 Filipino men worked in clerical positions


These 136 Asian Pacifics accounted for 15.7 percent of all the department's clerical workers.


The next highest concentration works in the ""sub-professional/technical"" classification. Here again Asian American women dominate, outnumbering Asian American men almost two-to-one. Adding the Asian and Filipino figures, there were 63 Asian American women and 34 Asian American men, and no Pacific Islanders.


Asian and Filipino men dominate in the ""professional"" classification, however. Here the attorney general employed 44 Asian American men and 22 Asian American women. In the ""supervisory professional"" category were three Asian American men and one Asian American woman.

SAN FRANCISCO -- On the first weekend of the 1989 Cherry Blossom Festival, April 14-16 and 21-23, a ""Miss Cherry Blossom"" event will be held to select -- from among interested young Nikkei women -- a representative of the Japanese American Community of Northern California. This event replaces the Cherry Blossom Festival queen pageant which had been held annually until suspended in 1988.


A survey conducted in the community late last year indicated widespread support for reintroducing a program of this type at future festivals. The majority of the survey respondents particularly favored an event strongly emphasizing Japanese and Japanese American culture.


Efforts now are under way to plan and present an exciting, meaningful program that will address the mandate. Yo Hironaka and Benh Nakajo, cochairs of this year's ""Miss Cherry Blossom"" committee, are arranging this event which they say will be similar in some ways to past queen pageants, but also quite different in others.


Detailed information and application forms for young women interested in participating in the ""Miss Cherry Blossom"" event will be available soon. In the meantime additional information may be obtained by contacting Yo Hironaka at (415) 387-4050 or Benh Nakajo at (415) 765-8541.

For over 150 years Chinese have participated in American history from some of its darker moments such as sharecropping and the McCarthy era to its brighter side that offers the chance to succeed and freedom to pursue individuality.


Ruthanne Lum McCunn in her latest book, Chinese American Portraits, provides a moving history of Chinese Americans by using biographical sketches and over 150 photographs.


McCunn deals with the delimma of Chinese immigrants as well as American-born Chinese who have been forced by society to live on the fringe due to prejudice and/or pressure to conform to preconceived stereotypical molds. Their achievements are often overlooked in an overview of American history.


One accomplishment of McCunn's book is to shatter stereotypical images by focusing on Chinese persuing a wide range of professions and living an equally wide range of lifestyles scattered all across the country, rather than solely in the more densely populated areas of San Francisco and New York.


For instance, few images of Chinese sharecroppers living in the Missisippi delta region and marrying black women come to mind when you think of the role of Chinese in history.


""Chinese come in all colors -- many people have no idea that there are black Chinese. When people talk about intermarriage, they're only thinking about white-Chinese marriages, but Chinese have intermarried with blacks, Native Americans and Mexicans,"" said McCunn.


One of the more disheartening facts in the history of Chinese men marrying emancipated black slave women, is that eventually the Chinese settlers came to realize that a higher status was to be had by sending for women from China, thus becoming racial ""purists"" and ostricizing any Chinese who had married a black from their community.


However, racial prejudice didn't always work that way. With the anti-miscegenation laws that forbade marriages in Arizona, California, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dekota, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming between whites and people of color, a Chinese man in Utah was prevented from marrying a black woman whom the official considered mulatto because of her light skin, thus interpreting the law to include anyone who was part Caucasian. In some states this law was not struck from the books until as late as 1967.


Prejudice becomes relative when McCunn describes the anger of a Chinese woman because her daughter was going to marry a Chinese boy whose family was from another province in China, with the mother asking, ""You're going to marry someone from so far away?"" ""He's not from far away,"" the daughter responded, ""he's from Jackson Street and we live on Montgomery Street."" The girl ignored her mother's outlandish protests.


Award-winning author Eleanor Wong, who grew up as a member of the only Chinese family in Albert Lea, Minnesota, and went on to write the book, It's Crazy to Stay Chinese in Minnesota, never gave much thought to being called ""chinky chinky Chinaman,"" rather she equated it to her mother's usual reference to whites as bak gwai or white devils; the same Mrs. Wong who would chase her children with a broom if they dared to speak English at all in the house.


Every kind of racial prejudice conceivable surfaces in McCunn's book -- even the kind that turns inward. Wong describes the experiment of playwright Frank Chin asking students at San Francisco State University to fold a piece of paper in half, listing their Chinese qualities on one side and their American qualities on the other.


""Everything that was interesting, adventurous, original, creative, fun, sexy, daring, artistic, was American. Everything old-fashioned, inhibiting, restraining, dull, repressive, uncreative, stultifying, was Chinese. It's because the title Chinese American, the cliche blending East and West encourages you to say, 'Well, what are my Chinese parts? What are my American parts?' And what you break down, you break down according to the lines of stereotype. It's something conditioned into you that you don't even realize. It's self-contempt,"" McCunn quotes Chin as saying.


In McCunn's section entitled ""Contemporaries,"" she concentrates on the struggles and triumphs of Chinese American artists, once again breaking the stereotypical image of Asians as uncreative. Adrienne Telemaque, a native New Yorker and daughter of author Eleanor Wong, is half-Chinese and half-Haitian and married Phillip Nash, who is of Japanese and Irish descent. She says, ""My friends are from every culture, choosing just one or two would be too isolating.""


Telemaque joined the San Francisco Ballet Company at age 16, but left the profession in her early 20s because individuality wasn't complementary to a ballet corps. Theater is her preferred profession, but she finds that often she has to compromise herself, don a Suzie Wong wig and give in to the stereotypical image that so many casting agents have in mind when they think of an Asian female.


Telemaque joins the ranks with many other actors who know how tough it is to break into a role that allows an Asian to be more three-dimensional.


McCunn quotes local television anchor Emerald Yeh as saying, ""People think Asians have done so well, but how can you say that if one entire gender group is hardly visible?"" referring to the broadcast industry's hiring of only ""exotic"" women but not ""unattractive"" Asian men, who are often bypassed for promotions ""because of perceptions that they are quiet and passive and therefore weak and less capable of handling people.""


Not only does McCunn offer little-known facts about the history of Chinese in America, but she often includes interesting tidbits about China. In her biography about Lai Yun Oi, who came from Namhoi to San Francisco, her homeland sounds like a feminist haven: ""Most women in nineteenth century China were considered no more than chattel. But the women in Namhoi, where Lai Yun Oi lived, were physically and economically independent. Many women refused to marry, committing themselves to remaining single by going through a sau-hai ceremony of combing up their hair, sometimes joining sisterhood for mutual support.""


McCunn has done an admirable job of exposing the way Chinese have been Americans making history for over a century, and a half and of bringing noteworthy pioneers and cutting edge contemporaries to light. Her book deserves attention.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Last Saturday afternoon cello maestro Yo-Yo Ma infiltrated the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra for an impressive performance of Mussorgsky-Ravel's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" and Barber's ""Adagio for Strings."" Ma emerged later from the strings section to coach two fine young cellists, Erica Zumsteg and Semyon Kobialka, working with them on Saint-Saens' ""Cello Concert No. 1.""


The special open rehearsal with Yo-Yo Ma was a benefit for the S.F. Symphony Youth Orchestra's Asian Tour Scholarship Fund, the tour taking place in June/July 1989, with Leif Bjaland, the SFSYO's director, leading the orchestra on an 18-day tour of Asia.


Ma in the role of teacher was fascinating and informative to watch as he complimented Zumsteg and Kobialka on their playing while finding ways for them to improve upon it. He prompted Zumsteg to develop ears in the back of her head and not to tense her hand and arm, but to trust her hand to execute the notes she could miss with the interference of tension.


He advised Kobialka to handle part of Saint-Saens', ""Concerto"" as though he were fed up with something and putting his foot down about it. He also cautioned Kobialka and the rest of the orchestra to listen carefully to each other and to avoid barriers between the soloist and orchestra. Ma demonstrated a tremondous amount of energy and sensitivity to his young pupils, before playing the solo they had been working on with the SFSYO. As always Ma's musical genuis shone brillantly, his performing exquisite.


Kobialka, whose playing Ma described as ""gorgeous"" and rightfully so, is 15 years old, a student at University High school, and has been a member of the youth orchestra for five years. A product of a musical family, Kobialka's Russian father is the Principal Second Violin for the SF Symphony and his Japanese mother teaches piano at the SF Conservatory of Music.


""Yo-Yo Ma is the god of cello, but when you talk with him, he just chats like a real person and he's really down to earth,"" said Kobialka, who decided on the cello after playing the violin and piano for many years.


""When I played piano or violin my parents were always on me, because they knew what I was doing, but the cello was more of my own thing,"" said Kobialka, who isn't sure if he will choose music as a profession, but hopes to find a school that has a good music department, where he can combine his cello studies with the sciences and the liberal arts.


Erica Zumsteg, the other cellist with whom Ma worked, is 15 years old, a student at Lick Wilmerding High School and has been with the youth orchestra for three years. She and Kobialka are both students of Irene Sharp. Zumsteg like Kobialka, is unsure if she will persue a professional career in music, but she enjoys immensely her position with the youth orchestra.


""Yo-Yo Ma asks a lot of questions like 'how can you hear yourself when you are playing?' This experience has been kind of an exciting thing, especially with Yo-Yo Ma,"" said Zumsteg.

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Paul Simon is expected to introduce a comprehensive immigration bill this week that would increase the number of visas available under the fifth preference and reduce the waiting period for family reunification.


It follows a bill introduced earlier this month by Sen. Ted Kennedy and Sen. Alan Simpson that restricts siblings coming in under the fifth preference, giving consideration only to non-married brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens.


John Trasvina, a legislative aide to Simon in Washington, said in contrast to the Kennedy bill, the Simon bill allows brothers and sisters to be reunited regardless of their marital status.


He also pointed out that the Kennedy bill proposes to reduce incoming fifth preference visas from 64,800 to 52,000 for the first three years, followed by a mere 22,000 after that.


Simon's bill would increase this number to 82,000 under the fifth preference category.


""The Simon bill does not restrict the eligibility or reduce the numbers,"" Trasvina stressed. ""The Kennedy bill does both.""


Asians such as Filipinos wishing to live in America currently wait up to 15 years to get a visa, and Trasvina claimed that under Kennedy's legislation the wait would be even longer. He claimed Simon's bill would reduce the wait by 25 percent.


He also expressed confidence regarding the legislation's congressional support.


""(Sen. Alan) Cranston was an original co-sponsor of the legislation and we are getting good strong support from the Hispanic and Asian communities. The Simon bill is much more favorable to these communities.""


Noting the differences in the two bills, Trasvina said he would like to see the best of both brought together.


""It is not which bill is passed it is what the final bill will look like,"" Trasvina said.

Question: Which is more important, justice or image? This line of thought forced itself to the surface recently as I read a Filipino American newspaper story about a New Jersey man accused of stabbing four Filipinos to death last Memorial Day. As is the case with many murder cases in Asian America, this has apparently united the ethnic community.


But with a twist! The alleged mass murderer is himself a Filipino, and the united community is rallying to save him from the cruel American death penalty.


This 24-year-old Filipino American stands accused of murdering his own mother and brother and two family friends. Nowhere in the story did I find anything suggesting a plea of innocence; in fact his own defense attorney -- quoting medical experts -- described his client as ""a gravely ill young man"" who is ""very, very disturbed.""


But five Filipino American lawyers have volunteered -- volunteered, as in donated -- their assistance for the defense, as has a prominent Filipino American psychiatrist in an attempt to ""take care of the cultural aspect of (the) defense,"" the paper reported. A well-known Filipino author is writing a book about the case to illustrate the ""psychological problems encountered by other Filipinos as they immigrate to the U.S.""


""The Filipino community newspapers have demonstrated their support"" for the movement to defend the suspect, the paper noted.


And a ranking officer in the Philippine diplomatic corps was quoted telling the Filipino community to get involved because ""the outcome of this case will affect and have a bearing on our image.""


A bearing on our image? Four people were brutally stabbed to death, and yet the defense sounds like it is centering on the ""cultural aspect"" and the pressures faced by immigrants in a new land.


This knee-jerk reaction, to defend a man on the basis of ethnicity rather than guilt or innocence, will have a far worse bearing on the image of the Asian American community.


In a similar vein Asian Americans tend to sweep some very real community problems under the rug in order to preserve their image. Don't dare mention ""gangs,"" or you'll be accused of perpetuating stereotypes. Nope, ain't no crime in Chinatown (or J-town, Koreatown or Little Saigon), so just don't you go around talking about any such thing.


Strength of the family! Asians have no problems because they have this unbelievably strong family support system, right? Don't believe what you hear about domestic violence in the Asian community. Nope, we ain't got none of that around here.


Straight-A students! (Would you like a copy of the text of our valedictorian's speech to print in your next issue?) Nope, our kids don't have any problems in school. Don't believe what you hear about some of them struggling to get a grasp of what's going on in class.


Drugs? Don't be ridiculous! There's no problem with drugs -- our people are too busy studying and working hard and saving our money and providing emotional support to other family members to waste time on drugs. Nope, ain't no problem here.


. . . And after a while, someone notices that the image campaign has worked. American society thinks Asian Americans have no problems, the ""whiz kid"" stereotype must be true after all, there are no drugs or crime, everything is-rosy. So the government cuts funding for social services in the Asian communities because, after all, they don't need social services. They are, after all, a MODEL MINORITY.


Most Asian Americans have by now realized the danger in this line of reasoning. It is better to be open about the Asian communities problems. Unless these problems are faced squarely and honestly, they will never be solved.


Going back to the case of the accused mass murderer in New Jersey. Heaven help the suspect if he were a non-Asian! If he were, long before this man accused of killing four Filipinos ever had his day in court, Asians throughout the country would lobby their congressmen, demand a federal investigation, hold banquets to raise funds to support the new civil rights organizations that would spring up on both coasts, and new political careers would rise out of the ashes.


But the suspect is an Asian. Let's let the courts find out if he's guilty or innocent.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Vietnamese Fishermen Association of America and six individual fishermen filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against the U.S. Coast Guard in U.S. District Court in San Francisco charging that a federal statute which bars non-citizens from piloting fishing vessels deprives them not only of their civil rights, but their livelihood.


Vietnamese fishermen are being detained and cited by the U.S. Coast Guard for allegedly violating a 200-year-old statute barring non-citizens from U.S. fishing waters.


Co-counsel for the fishermen are Dennis Hayashi of the Asian Law Caucus; Edward Chen of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California; Alan W. Sparer and Carl L. Blumenstein of Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canday, Robertson and Falk; and Michael G. Lee of Minami, Lew, Tamaki and Lee.


The attorneys charge that the statute is unconstitutional for violating the fishermen's right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.


""The statute being enforced is patently unconstitutional,"" said Hayashi. ""It stands in clear violation of the equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment by discriminating against non-citizens and resident aliens. Furthermore, there are questions as to why this law is being enforced now.""


As early as January of this year, the U.S. Coast Guard cited several Vietnamese fishermen for violating the statute barring non-citizens from piloting fishing vessels. The fishermen are mostly resident aliens who have not been in the U.S. long enough to acquire citizenship. The enforcement of the statute has been intermittent and irregular for the past several months.


Most recently, on September 16, the Coast Guard boarded several boats carrying Vietnamese fishermen, told them to return to port immediately, and to cease fishing. In some instances, fishermen were threatened with seizure of their documents and licenses if caught fishing again, which would effectively prohibit them from using their boats.


According to Chieu Pham, president of the Vietnamese Fishermen's Association of America, ""Until this year, the U.S. Coast Guard has never charged any member of the association for violating laws requiring U.S. citizenship to pilot or own fishing vessels."" He added, ""Unless enforcement of the citizenship requirement is enjoined, I believe that many of the association members will be forced out of the fishing industry.""


""The Coast Guard's action has had a chilling effect on the fishermen and their activities,"" said Chen. ""It effectively deprives the fishermen and their families of their livelihood and primary means of support for no rational reason.""


""This outright discrimination advances no national interest and only succeeds in economically and socially displacing hard-working, tax-paying members of the community,"" added Blumenstein.


""The case if significant in light of the struggle against rising anti-Asian sentiment. Recent incidents highlighting violence and hatred against Asians have received prominence both locally and nationwide,"" added Hayashi: ""The fishermen themselves have previously been subjected to harassment here in California and in Texas.""


The suit asks the court to issue a temporary restraining order enjoining the Coast Guard from enforcing the statute and for a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional.


Defendants named in the suit include; Admiral Paul Yost, commandant of the United States Coast Guard and Rear Admiral J.W. Kime, commander of the 11th Coast Guard District.

Since dance is a social activity and expresses cultural norms, assumptions and cliches abound. These norms and technical proficiency mould the taste and criteria from which we critics applaud, approve, denounce and denigrate the dances and dancers we watch. The Queen in Alice in Wonderland, ""Off With His Head"" has nothing on critics and dancers themselves.


A week apart I saw two marvelous young dancers, one from San Jose and one from the island of Bali, demonstrate their command of a given technique: Andres Reyes of San Francisco Ballet and the young Balinese, I Wayan Murdi (I think), in the program notes at Zellerbach Hall, March 31. Since Bali doesn't give out blurbs on dancers' backgrounds, this is something of a guess. That fact is a pity for he was both brilliant technically and expressive emotionally.


Both male dancers were called upon to perform roles of male dominance which provided ripples of pleasure and hokum to an avid audience.


Young Reyes was teamed with Joanna Berman in ""Le Corsaire,"" a Petipa opus credited with an 1899 creation date and music by Riccardo Drigo. Historically the original ballet was one by the French choreographer Maziller, music by Adolph Adam and based on a poem of Lord Byron. It is an extravagant tale of abduction and counter-abduction, one improbably mounted upon another.


No one informs us from which act this pas de deux survives, nor when the bared chest became de rigeur for the male dancer. But it's now as standard as the tutu and tiara for the ballerina, in this case Joanna Berman who obviously watched dozens of dancers in the role when she was in the 1985 Moscow Competition.


Reyes at this point has . . . the technicalities of the role and is concentrating on its finish and polish. For a pirate he is quite serious and attentive, nothing of the feisty tiger which Nureyev made so notable. I didn't miss that interpretation. It simply is exciting to witness two young locally trained dancers essay this piece, one of the measurements of classic technique which has survived from the 19th century. Ten years ago, even five years ago, such an achievement would not have been possible. What this bravura says of ballet in the S.F. Bay Area is that this collaborative theatrical art form has come of age with as much zest and sparkle as Reyes and Berman emitted in their performance. Their bravos have been built on the development of the S.F. company Helgi Tomasson is bringing so remarkably to its maturity. As part of a rarely balanced program, Reyes and Berman's rendition was a brilliant gem.


The unnamed Balinese dancer performed Baris, a warrior dance to display pride, strength, power and confidence, Kebyar Trompong, another solo dance which had been devised by I Mario, and a love duet, Raja Pala.


Balinese technique contrasts with Western ballet in its emphasis on space by seeming almost stationary. The dancer stands with bent legs most of the time, often in second position and moves sideways or weaves his way forward and back with an intricate crossing of the feet while the torso extends itself sideways and the neck, arms and hands are lifted to undulate and flutter and circle.


Don't let the difference deceive you. Balinese dance is a remarkable and a difficult style. This time around, the Balinese have outdone themselves with their costumes and there was a lion dance with a shaggy mane and elaborate mask which was simply enchanting.

LOS ANGELES -- A high-level City Hall executive said she is running for a seat on the board of trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District because she attended LACC and wants to keep the educational opportunity open and viable for others who need it.


Rose Ochi, executive assistant to Mayor Tom Bradley and director of criminal justice planning, said her community college education was an important link between her high school graduation and higher education.


""I grew up in an immigrant family where English was not spoken. I knew I had the ability to do college work but I needed more time to prepare myself. So I went to a community college before I got into the UC system.""


She received an associate of arts degree in 1957 and went on to complete a BA at the University of California, Los Angeles, two years later.


Ochi also values community colleges because these are places where people may learn new skills to improve themselves or become educated in a different field for a new career.


""In my mother's country -- in Japan -- people pretty much stay in the same place in society that they are born into. But in the United States people have plenty of opportunities to make a better life for themselves through education.""


After teaching school in East Los Angeles for a number of years, she went back to school to earn a master's from the California State University, Los Angeles, and a law degree from the University of Loyola in 1972.


She practiced law for a couple of years before joining the Bradley administration in 1974, and has been in her current position for the last 14 years.


She said her experiences as a city office manager, executive, teacher and student have all helped to prepare her for the task of managing the $200 million budget for the nine community college campuses and for setting educational policies.


""The most critical task facing the largest community college system in the world is -- how is the district going to continue to upgrade its educational programs to meet the needs of its 100,000 students with declining revenues?"" Ochi said.


""The board members will have to be major advocates of the community colleges to bring in resources. I think I can be a very good board member because I have experience working with people from Sacramento, plus I have personal ties with many state officials."" It would take a lot of work with the state and the legislature before sufficient funding may be secured for the community colleges, she said.


Additionally, Ochi pointed out that as an attorney she has been involved in law reform litigation and legislative advocacy with particular emphasis on educational and urban issues.


""I spent two years of my life as a co-counsel at trial in the landmark (case) Serrano v. Priest, a lawsuit challenging the state system of school finance."" Her approach in getting public policy changed is ""pro-active,"" said Ochi, and she would bring the same approach to meeting other problems.


She is confident of winning the April 11 election because she has the endorsements of Mayor Bradley, the teacher's union, the county labor union, and three of what she hopes are her future colleagues on the community college board.


""Three other serious contenders dropped out of the race when they heard that I am running,"" Ochi claimed.

WASHINGTON -- The Bush Administration is being urged by the Asian community to appoint an Asian American to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights of Commissioner Sherwin Chan vacates his post.


Chan, the only Asian appointed to the commission since it was established in 1967, met with White House personnel earlier this month to voice his interest in heading the Federal Maritime Commission.


Currently one position on the Federal Maritime Commission is available and another is expected to open soon, as chair Elaine Chao has been nominated by Bush to serve as deputy secretary of transportation.


One community leader who wished not to be identified said Chan's departure would be a ""severe loss"" and ""could be very fatal."" Others have voiced concern over the person rumored for the chairmanship of the Civil Rights Commission, Arthur Fletcher, who served as assistant secretary of labor in the Nixon administration. Civil rights activists worry he will not support affirmative action.


Fletcher in 1971 supported a federal government plan to impose a racial quota on federal construction projects in Chicago after a voluntary equal hiring program ther collapsed.
